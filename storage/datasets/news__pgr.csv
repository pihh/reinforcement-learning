94437,315952,PGR,Parties unite over Taiwan s exclusion from WHO anti virus planning,news,"TAIPEI  Reuters    Taiwan s exclusion from World Health Organisation meetings on the coronavirus oubreak has united the island s political parties  who normally agree on little  especially to do with China 
Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objection of China  which considers it a Chinese province with no right to participate in international organizations as a separate entity 
Taiwan was not allowed to participate in an emergency WHO meeting on Wednesday about the new virus  which has killed at least 25 people since originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan last month  Taiwan has only reported one case 
Taiwan President Tsai Ing wen  re elected by a landslide this month on a platform of standing up to China  this week called on the WHO to set aside political considerations and grant it full access to virus updates 
 Taiwan is at the forefront of global epidemic prevention  There needs to be room at the WHO for Taiwan s participation   she told reporters 
Taiwan s main opposition party  the Kuomintang  which favors close ties with China  expressed its anger saying that epidemic prevention should know no boundaries 
 Please could the WHO cast aside political considerations  If Taiwan is alone in being left out of epidemic prevention work it will leave a gap  and is not beneficial to promoting epidemic prevention work around the world   it said in a statement 
Taipei Mayor Ko Wen je  a doctor by training who is no friend of either Tsai s Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party nor the Kuomintang  added his voice of disapproval 
 In recent years  Taiwan has been placed outside the world s epidemic prevention system  and has no way of getting first hand information  This is a problem   said Ko  whose Taiwan People s Party won its first parliamentary seats this month 
China says such concerns are nonsense  China s foreign ministry said this week nobody cares more about Taiwan s people than China s central government 
Taiwan s Centres for Disease Control also say they have smooth channels with China  though it has also complained about its inability to get first hand information from the WHO 
Mike Ryan  executive director of the WHO emergencies program  told a news conference in Geneva on Thursday they work closely with technical partners in what he termed  China  Taiwan  
 And I believe the authorities in Taiwan are working very closely with China in the mainland and I believe there have been joint missions and joint approaches to the response   he said ",2020-01-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/parties-unite-over-taiwans-exclusion-from-who-antivirus-planning-2066818,2066818

94467,315982,PGR,As Warren Sanders spat intensifies  liberal grassroots groups seek to calm tensions,news,"By Joseph Ax
NEW YORK  Reuters    Liberal grassroots groups on Thursday launched a bid to calm tensions between supporters of the two progressive standard bearers in the Democratic presidential race  U S  Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren  who have engaged in a days long feud after months of non aggression 
Led by the political action committee Democracy for America  the 18 groups announced the  Progressives Unite 2020  campaign  which includes a promise to  focus our fight for the nomination against candidates supported by the corporate wing  instead of fighting each other  
The spat between Warren and Sanders stems from a private conversation they had in December 2018 to discuss the 2020 race  when both senators were laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign to challenge incumbent Republican Donald Trump 
Warren has said Sanders told her he did not believe a woman could be elected president  a comment that Sanders has denied making 
The dispute intensified on Wednesday  when CNN aired previously unreleased audio of the two speaking after Tuesday night s Democratic debate in Iowa  Warren  ignoring Sanders  offer to shake hands  said   I think you just called me a liar on national TV  
Sanders responded that Warren  in fact  had called him a liar but said they should discuss the incident another time 
The new coalition includes groups that have backed Sanders  such as Our Revolution and the Sunrise Movement  as well as organizations supporting Warren  such as the Working Families Party and the Progressive  NYSE PGR  Change Campaign Committee 
The groups said they would ask their members to sign a pledge to  vote strategically  in their states to ensure either Warren or Sanders emerges as the nominee  In other words  if their top choice falters  they would vote for the other liberal despite the current feud 
Warren and Sanders had informally agreed not to attack one another at the campaign s outset  a truce that largely held until last weekend  when Politico reported that the Sanders campaign was training its canvassers to tell voters that Warren would not expand the party s base ",2020-01-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/as-warrensanders-spat-intensifies-liberal-grassroots-groups-seek-to-calm-tensions-2061265,2061265
94468,315983,PGR,Flap with Warren knocks Sanders  strategy off course,news,By Simon Lewis and James Oliphant WASHINGTON  Reuters    The best laid plans of Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders were upended this week   and his campaign is struggling to get back on track   Sanders went into the week looking to draw a sharper contrast between his progressive agenda and that of former Vice President Joe Biden  a moderate and his top rival for the Democratic nomination  Instead  his flap with fellow senator  friend and progressive ally Elizabeth Warren over gender and electability has dominated the news  an unwelcome twist for a campaign that pulled into the top of the race in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire just weeks before the first voting begins  The U S  senator from Vermont has found himself on the defensive after Warren accused him of telling her during a 2018 meeting that a woman could not beat Republican President Donald Trump in the November election  Sanders has denied saying that  The disagreement between the two liberals grew more inflamed after a CNN microphone caught Warren telling Sanders he made her out to be a liar at Tuesday s debate in Iowa   The back and forth has had their supporters at odds on social media  distressing progressives who want to present a unified front against a  corporate Democrat  going into the 2020 nominating contests  which kick off on Feb  3 in Iowa  So far  the dispute does not appear to have hurt Sanders  who saw his support among independents and Democrats rise by 2 points to 20    ahead of Biden s 19    in the past week  according to a Reuters Ipsos opinion poll conducted on Wednesday and Thursday  Warren was at 12 percent in the poll  Her momentum has stalled since November  when she detailed how she would finance the Medicare for All government health insurance proposal she and Sanders have championed   Progressive  NYSE PGR  groups worry that bad blood could push some supporters of either Sanders or Warren to defect to a more moderate candidate such as Biden or former South Bend  Indiana  Mayor Pete Buttigieg if their candidate falters  The Sanders campaign sought on Thursday to turn the conversation away from Warren and back to Biden  with whom Sanders disagrees on matters ranging from foreign policy to trade  Sanders  supporters have shared videos of past speeches where Biden spoke in favor of the invasion of Iraq  which Sanders opposed    The focus for progressives should be on making sure that we have a progressive nominee  and the person standing in the way of having a nominee with the strongest progressive record is Joe Biden   Sanders speechwriter David Sirota told Reuters   Other damage control efforts were under way  Almost 20 progressive groups said on Thursday they were joining together to mount a unity campaign aimed at calming tensions between Warren and Sanders and ensuring that a liberal becomes the nominee   A Democratic strategist aligned with Warren who asked not to be identified suggested her campaign was moving on from the matter and focusing on  driving home her core campaign themes    Warren s supporters have neither been encouraged nor barred from talking about the 2018 meeting  the strategist said  Warren s campaign did not respond to a request for comment   Both Warren and Sanders  along with presidential rival Amy Klobuchar  will have to take time away from the campaign trail ahead of the Iowa nominating contest to serve as jurors in the Senate impeachment trial of Trump   TO THE WALL  The Sanders Warren conflict was forcing the most passionate supporters of each candidate  to the wall    making them take sides against the other  said Charles Chamberlain  chair of Democracy for America  which is leading the effort to defuse tensions   We re trying to bring them back to the table   Chamberlain said  That may be difficult  Some of Sanders  online supporters have reacted angrily to the spat  using the hashtags  NeverWarren and  WarrenIsASnake or posted the snake emoji in the feeds of Warren and her supporters   Boy what a bad actor  Warren  turned out to be   RoseAnn DeMoro  a labor activist who campaigns for Sanders  universal healthcare plan  tweeted on Wednesday before CNN s audio release of the post debate exchange between Warren and Sanders   She betrayed a friend  undermined the movement  and all for political opportunism    Some voters who spoke to Reuters expressed alarm   Them arguing is just going to hurt one of them in the long run   Allison Plendl  32  said at a Buttigieg event in Algona  Iowa   It s just giving ammunition to the other side   The Warren camp saw some blowback on Thursday when Michael Pedersen  a New Hampshire state representative who had backed Warren  switched to Klobuchar after Tuesday s debate  Klobuchar s campaign said   Pedersen said he now viewed Klobuchar as more likely to beat Trump than Warren because he believes the U S  senator from Minnesota appeals to a wider swath of voters  Others saw Warren getting the better of the exchange with Sanders  Michael Ceraso  a Democratic operative who worked for Sanders  campaign in 2016  said Warren was able to make a strong argument for her own electability in November on the debate stage before millions of Americans    It was a breakout moment   he said

94469,315984,PGR,Taiwan s China friendly opposition seeks makeover after election drubbing,news,"By Felice Wu and Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI  Reuters    Driven out of China after losing a civil war  Taiwan s main opposition party faces another crisis following an election drubbing this month  seeking to re invent itself and rethink its unpopular policy of trying to accommodate Beijing 
The Kuomintang  which ruled all of China until forced to flee to Taiwan in 1949  soundly lost both the presidential and parliamentary elections to the Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  DPP   whose promises to stand up to China s threats contrasted with its own platform to be more conciliatory toward Beijing 
China claims Taiwan as its sacred territory  to be taken by force if needed  with President Xi Jinping last year once again proposing a  one country  two systems  model for the island  only to be denounced by both the DPP and Kuomintang 
Taiwan President Tsai Ing wen won re election by a landslide by positioning Taiwan as an independent country staunchly defending its democratic system against autocratic China 
Kuomintang chairman Wu Den yih resigned in the aftermath of the defeat  and the party will vote for a new leader in early March 
But it is riven by disagreement over what its policy toward China should be  especially as many people  particularly the young  increasingly identify themselves as Taiwanese  with little connection to China  or even reason to be nice to it 
During campaigning the Kuomintang proposed returning to the  92 consensus   a vague deal it struck with the Chinese Communist Party in 1992  by which both agreed there is but one China  though each can have its own interpretation of the term 
The DPP used that proposal to drive home a message that the Kuomintang wanted to sell out the island to the Communist Party  The Kuomintang emphatically denied that 
 Everybody is clueless now  because the  92 consensus  is the bedrock for all of us  If we don t use it  then what   Allen Tien  head of Kuomintang s Youth League  told Reuters 
 In comparison   Resisting China and protecting Taiwan  is a fancier slogan  We need to get a new name for the  92 consensus   
Beijing insists the  92 consensus  must be the basis for any talks with Taiwan 
OTHER PROBLEMS AHEAD
There is no obvious new leader  though possible candidates include Eric Chu  who stood unsuccessfully for the presidency in 2016  and Sean Lien  the U S  educated son of a former vice president 
The party needs a  collective leadership   Lien said last week  Chu has not commented 
Some are taking a more direct approach to the party s problems 
A group of Kuomintang members  including some lawmakers  launched a Facebook  NASDAQ FB  page over the weekend to canvass ideas from the public toward a China policy  saying the party had never denied China was a threat to Taiwan 
 The crux lies in what is the best choice for the attitude Taiwan takes to face mainland China   the group said in a statement  adding that close trade ties between the two  as well as a shared language and culture  offered Taiwan an opportunity 
Adding to the gloom  the Kuomintang s presidential candidate Han Kuo yu could face removal from his position as mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung 
He is the target of a petition seeking a recall vote  which could happen this summer  if approved by Taiwan s election commission  Han says he will respect the will of the public 
There have even been suggestions that the party drop the China reference in its name  which translates literally as Chinese Nationalist Party  though for now that looks unlikely 
 Everybody knows we need to change   Hsu Chiao hsin  a Kuomintang city councilor in Taipei  told Reuters  referring to the party s China policy   But we should not make ourselves unrecognizable  ",2020-01-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/taiwans-chinafriendly-opposition-seeks-makeover-after-election-drubbing-2063024,2063024

The finance ministry has been asked to consider more generous tax incentives to attract domestic and foreign investment this year  Somkid Jatusripitak told reporters 
 Currently  we offer a tax deduction of 1 5 times on investment  But the new package will offer more  plus many other measures  Somkid said   This will definitely increase investment even more  
Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana told reporters that the ministry planned to offer a tax deduction of 2 5 times on investment  and there would be tax exemptions on imports of machinery 
Both measures  to be introduced during January December  are expected to draw investment of more than 100 billion baht   3 29 billion   he added 
 It s the first time that we will offer this high 2 5 times  tax deduction    he said   Both measures will cost the government about 9 billion in lost revenue  But it s worth it  
Uttama said the government would also offer soft loans for businesses 
Somkid said the Board of Investment was also planning additional measures to support investment  Last year  Thailand offered a relocation package to draw foreign companies seeking to move production because of Sino U S  trade tensions 
Somkid said the government would also accelerate large transport projects  the auction of 5G spectrum and offer investment by state companies to help improve business activity 
On trade  the government is working on membership in the Comprehensive and Progressive  NYSE PGR  Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership  CPTPP   Somkid said  A fund will be provided to help business that may be affected by the deal  he said

94493,316008,PGR,Taiwan election is make or break for fleeing Hong Kong protesters,news,"By Felice Wu and Yimou Lee
TAIPEI  Reuters    A small but growing number of Hong Kong protesters who fled to Taiwan for safety over the past few months fear an opposition victory in the island s election this week will put them in peril and force them to leave 
The mostly young men and women who came to Taiwan after taking part in increasingly violent protests in support of democracy in Hong Kong have no legal way to gain permanent asylum  but President Tsai Ing wen s broadly sympathetic government has allowed about 60 of them to temporarily extend their stay 
Some of those protesters fear that support will vanish if the Jan  11 election is won by Han Kuo yu  the presidential candidate for Taiwan s Kuomintang opposition party  which favors close ties with China 
 If Han Kuo yu is elected  I will buy a flight ticket and flee to another country right away   a protestor in his early 30s who asked only to be identified as Jero told Reuters 
Jero said he flew to Taiwan on a tourist visa days after he took part in the storming of Hong Kong s Legislative Council on July 1 fearing he could be charged with rioting  which carries a maximum prison term of 10 years 
He now lives in a small studio in Taipei funded by a network of local activists supporting the protesters 
The issue of Hong Kong has played a large role in Taiwan s election campaign  Tsai has vowed to defend the island s sovereignty and has rejected China s suggestion of a  one country  two systems  political formula  saying it has failed in Hong Kong 
Han  who says he wants to forge strong ties with Beijing and met with Hong Kong s embattled leader Carrie Lam and senior Chinese officials last year  has accused Tsai of using the Hong Kong protests to whip up fears of China for electoral gain 
Both Tsai and Han have voiced support for Hong Kong protesters  But the prospect of a Han presidency is more concerning to the protesters 
 Hong Kong people are fighting against the Chinese Communist Party  but how could we convince ourselves that the Kuomintang is also against the Communist Party   said a protester called Roger  whose tourist visa has been extended twice since his arrival in Taiwan in July 
Jacob Lin  a Taipei based lawyer who is part of a team that has been offering legal assistance to protesters seeking residency in Taiwan since mid summer  said many protesters are worried about a change of political control 
 If the ruling party is replaced  the treatment for protesters may be quite different   he said  referring to Tsai s Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  DPP  
Responding to protesters  concerns about a Han victory  Han spokeswoman Anne Wang urged Hong Kong protesters not to be used by the DPP for electoral gain 
 I hope they have a true understanding of Mr  Han s insistence on the value of democracy and freedom   she said   He s solely against provocation  conflict and war  but he s in full support of Hong Kong s democracy and freedom  
Hong Kong s Security Bureau told Reuters in a statement that those accused of breaking the law in the city will have an open and fair trial  and any accusation of politically motivated prosecutions are  unfounded  
 PROTECTIVE UMBRELLA 
Taiwan s government has helped close to 60 protesters who are seeking shelter on the island for  political  reasons since the protests started about six months ago  a senior government official with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters 
The official  who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter  said Taiwan has been offering  assistance on an individual basis  to protesters  discreetly allowing them to extend tourist visas multiple times or facilitating applications for student or work visas 
Taiwan s government will not deport those who had made it there  the official said 
 If we don t help Hong Kong when they are in trouble  who is going to help Taiwan when we are in trouble   he said 
Taiwan s Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement that it will  appropriately handle individual cases  in accordance with existing laws  without elaborating 
Tired of waiting around  some are taking direct action to help the protesters restart their lives in Taiwan 
Hong Kong based rights lawyer Daniel Wong is leading an initiative to set up at least 10 companies from a laundry service to a restaurant in Taiwan to give protesters much needed residency via work visas 
Wong said the plan  dubbed  project protective umbrella   will be funded by a group of anonymous supporters in Taiwan and Hong Kong  many of whom are lawyers  doctors and other professionals 
 We are going to help our own kids   he said   Hong Kong people are not refugees  
Huang Chun sheng  a pastor at a Presbyterian Church in Taipei which has received more than 100 protesters said he will set up a foundation for Hong Kongers in Taiwan to coordinate funding support for those needing shelters 
He said a few of those protesters had since returned to Hong Kong in the belief that they would likely not be charged there 
Shopping for daily necessities in Taipei  a protester in her 20s who identified herself as Tiffany sounded caution on the coming vote  and urged Taiwanese to vote for Tsai  who she says can protect the island s freedoms 
 I hope to study and find a job in Taiwan   she said   I hope Taiwanese can cherish the votes in their hands  ",2020-01-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/taiwan-election-is-make-or-break-for-fleeing-hong-kong-protesters-2052676,2052676

The vote pits President Tsai Ing wen of the pro independence Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party against Han Kuo yu from the Kuomintang party  which favors close ties with China 
Taiwan is decked out in campaign posters and flags  and as the candidates appeal for support from the backs of trucks  in markets and at temples  the atmosphere is ripe for artistic license 
Kuang Yi  who calls himself the  mad artist   fingerpaints next to a small lake in the artist village he built as a tourist attraction in the southern city of Tainan from hundred year old bricks  He said he tries not to take sides in his art 
 I have friends on both sides  they re all good friends   he says  referring to Taiwan s political camps that are divided first and foremost by their China policy 
On the other side of the island  in the northern city of Taoyuan  manga artist Wei Zong cheng takes a less neutral approach 
While Tsai is colored green  the DPP s color  Han is shaded purple rather than the Kuomintang s blue 
Wei says that is because he has mixed in a little red to show Han s China friendly stance  a reference to the color of China s ruling Communist Party 
Wei has also been drawing political cartoons for years for Taiwanese media 
But in Taiwan s fast moving political scene  where new scandals and controversies emerge seemingly every day  the cartoons can have a short shelf life

94498,316013,PGR,Taiwan s China friendly presidential hopeful faces backlash in divided south,news,"By Yimou Lee and James Pomfret
KAOHSIUNG  Taiwan  Reuters    In balmy southern Taiwan  with its rural hamlets  industrial belts and slower paced cities  a rising tide of residents are pushing back against opposition presidential hopeful Han Kuo yu  fearing he ll sell out core Taiwan interests to China 
Han  the mayor of the south s biggest city of Kaohsiung  had been expected to build his support base over the past year since winning office on a promise to help citizens  make a big fortune  by forging better economic ties with China 
Instead  as he prepares for the election on Saturday against incumbent president Tsai Ing wen and her independence minded Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  DPP   he has seen his fortunes wane  hammered by criticism over controversial public remarks and failing to deliver on campaign promises  including oil exploration in the South China Sea 
Last month  a coalition of groups called  Wecare Kaohsiung  held a mass anti Han rally that drew tens of thousands  some holding signs with the words  Dismiss pro Communist mayor  
 Every Taiwan leader needs to find a balance between the U S  and China  but with Han  he has completely shifted toward China   said Aaron Yin  one of the leaders of the movement 
Taiwan s vote for a new president and parliament comes at a delicate moment for its giant neighbor  and sentiment in southern Taiwan has become a key factor for the election  which could set the democratic island s future course with autocratic China 
In March last year  Han  whose Kuomintang Party favors close ties with China  paid a high profile visit to Hong Kong and China  where he met with senior Chinese officials and reiterated his commitment to  one China  as a core of cross strait relations 
Han s red carpet treatment raised alarm bells  as many Taiwanese harbor a deep mistrust of China  especially after Chinese President Xi Jinping threatened Taiwan with force 
 The main aim of this election is to reject any rapprochement with China   Yin told Reuters in a small office stacked with anti Han pamphlets and those pledging solidarity with the pro democracy protesters in Hong Kong 
POLITICAL MAVERICK
Han  62  has proven a divisive figure since reappearing in politics in 2017 to make a failed bid for the chairmanship of the Kuomintang  Known for fiery rhetoric  his ability to electrify crowds helped him clinch the mayorship of Kaohsiung in late 2018 
Although Han has said  one country  two systems  isn t an acceptable model for Taiwan  he has promised to restart dialogue with China if elected president and called for an agreement between China s Communists and the Kuomintang that both sides belong to  one China   with each having their own interpretation of what that means 
Han has described Taiwan s formal independence as scarier than syphilis and warned that Tsai s re election could lead to a  volcano eruption  of tensions with China 
Wang Lin Chiao  a Kuomintang politician seeking a parliamentary seat in the southern township of Meinong  said that stability is paramount  and that continued engagement with China is the only way forward 
 The 21st century belongs to China   Wang said as she campaigned on a quiet street with a three person support team  struggling to find people to speak to 
 Taiwan needs a good future  so we don t want to meddle in sensitive political issues and change things  People only care about money here  and having a safe life   she said  noting a decline in Chinese tourists and exports of agricultural produce to China after curbs by Beijing last year 
But some  such as Chiu Yi ying  a DPP lawmaker competing against Wang for the 222 700 voter constituency  say Taiwan must further deepen its  New Southbound Policy  of economic engagement with 18 countries in South east Asia  rather than rely on China 
Chiu peppers her lobbying with Hong Kong references  telling older voters that an influx of Chinese immigrants and tourists into Hong Kong since the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997 had substantially lengthened queues at public hospitals and depleted supplies of essentials like milk powder 
 That s when they really understand that Hong Kong today is Taiwan s tomorrow   she told Reuters in her campaign office  where massive billboards feature her smiling beside Tsai 
 IN A CAGE  
Some farmers and pigeon breeders in the south s rural patchwork of ponds and fields say they ve been scarred by past decades of conflicts with China and want to avoid that  But they can t ignore the realities of Hong Kong and the dangers faced by a more aggressive China under Xi 
 One country  two systems is not good   said Chen Jin Wen  a pigeon breeder in the north of the historic port city of Tainan as he exercised his birds along a stretch of coastline overlooking the Taiwan Strait  referring to the model by which China has been ruling Hong Kong 
 You see what s happening in Hong Kong  The Hong Kong people are used to freedom  like Taiwan people   he said  as his racing birds pecked about in a wooden cage before bolting skywards 
 But mainland China is taking it away from them now   he said   It s like my birds  they can fly free for a while but they always end up back in a cage  ",2020-01-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/taiwans-chinafriendly-presidential-hopeful-faces-backlash-in-divided-south-2055564,2055564

TAIPEI  Reuters    China will not change its position that Taiwan belongs to it  Beijing said on Sunday  after President Tsai Ing wen won re election and said she would not submit to China s threats  as state media warned she was courting disaster 
The election campaign was dominated by China s efforts to get the democratic island to accept Beijing s rule under a  one country  two systems  model  as well as by anti government protests in Chinese ruled Hong Kong 
 No matter what changes there are to the internal situation in Taiwan  the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change   China s Foreign Ministry said in a statement 
While China says Taiwan is its territory  Taiwan maintains it is an independent country called the Republic of China  its formal name 
Tsai  who has firmly rejected China s  one country  two systems  model  won another four year term by a landslide on Saturday  and her Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  DPP  secured a majority in parliament 
 Taiwan s people once again use the vote in their hands to show the world the value of democracy   Tsai said on Sunday when meeting the head of the United States  de facto embassy in Taipei  Brent Christensen 
 Democracy and freedom are indeed Taiwan s most valuable asset and the foundation of the long term Taiwan U S  partnership   Tsai said  vowing to deepen cooperation with the United States on issues from defense to economy 
On Saturday  Tsai called for talks to resume with China  but said she hoped Beijing understood Taiwan and its people would not submit to intimidation 
However  China will not change its stance on the  one China  principle and opposing Taiwan independence  the Chinese foreign ministry said 
 The universal consensus of the international community adhering to the  one China  principle will not change either  
China hoped the world would support the  just cause  of Chinese people to oppose secessionist activities and  realize national reunification   it added 
Taiwan s Mainland Affairs Council said China should respect the election result and stop putting pressure on the island 
 Our government will firmly defend the sovereignty of the Republic of China and Taiwan s democracy and freedom   it said 
 POLICY TOOLBOX 
China s official Xinhua news agency said Tsai won by deploying dirty tricks  hyping the China threat and colluding with Western forces 
 Whether it is to curb Taiwan independence secessionist activities or to benefit Taiwan compatriots  the mainland has a full  policy toolbox    it said 
 Tsai and the DPP must be aware that they should not act wilfully because of a fluke  
U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo congratulated Tsai and lauded her for seeking stability with China  in the face of unrelenting pressure  
Japan s Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi also sent congratulations  referring to Taiwan as a  precious friend  
China s Taiwan Affairs Office said on Saturday it would continue promoting the  one country  two systems  model for Taiwan  which Beijing uses to run Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy 
Many in the former British colony fear promises made under the system are not being kept 
On China s internet  there was unusual criticism for the Taiwan Affairs Office s failure to win over the island  especially as Tsai s win followed a landslide for pro democracy candidates in Hong Kong s local elections in November 
 What have you been doing   wrote one user on China s Twitter like Weibo   All the money you have spent and all you have done is give succor to hypocrites and traitors  
The criticism follows a denunciation of the Taiwan office on Friday by the Chinese Communist Party s anti corruption watchdog for not following the party line enthusiastically and being too bureaucratic ",2020-01-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/china-says-will-not-change-position-on-taiwan-after-landslide-election-2057489,2057489

TAIPEI  Reuters    Taiwan  urgently  needs to pass a planned anti infiltration law to face threats from China to penetrate the island  President Tsai Ing wen said on Friday  denouncing China s opposition to it as illogical and hypocritical 
The legislation is part of a years long effort to combat what many in Taiwan see as Chinese efforts to influence politics and the democratic process  through illicit funding of politicians and the media and other underhand methods 
China claims Taiwan as its territory  to be brought under Beijing s control by force if necessary  Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China  its official name 
Taiwan s ruling Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  DPP  has begun a renewed push for the legislation  ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan  11  The bill is due for debate in parliament again on Tuesday  when it may pass into law 
In a televised policy address   on which formal debate is set for Sunday   Tsai said the bill was about a threat from China that is not as easy to see as the likes of the Chinese aircraft carrier which sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Thursday 
 I think that certainly there is an urgency in Taiwan society for the anti infiltration law   Tsai said   I hope that we can as soon as possible examine it  
Taiwan s main opposition party  the Kuomintang  which favors close ties with China  has condemned the proposed legislation as a  political tool  of Tsai and her DPP to gain votes while trying to paint them as Chinese Communist Party agents 
They also say the bill will only criminalize normal exchanges with China  something Tsai and the DPP have denied 
China s policy making Taiwan Affairs Office reiterated its opposition to the bill this week too  saying the DPP was trying to  blatantly reverse over  democracy and increase enmity 
Tsai said it was totally hypocritical of an autocratic China that lacks democracy  human rights or freedom of speech to use the language of democracy to criticize the bill 
 China has no democracy and yet it is criticizing Taiwan for reversing over democracy   she said   China has no democratic elections and interferes in Taiwan s democratic elections the whole day long  This is an absurd and laughable position  
China has denied seeking to interfere in Taiwan s elections 
Tsai s main opponent  the Kuomintang s Han Kuo yu  did not directly mention the bill  but again slammed senior DPP politicians for previous visits they have made to China  Han went to China earlier this year and met senior officials

94528,316043,PGR,China offers new pre election inducement to Taiwan with revised law,news,"BEIJING  Reuters    China s largely rubber stamp parliament revised a law on Saturday to simplify investment procedures for Taiwan companies  in another attempt by Beijing to show goodwill to the Chinese claimed island ahead of elections there on Jan  11 
China  with its 1 3 billion people  is Taiwan s favorite investment destination with Taiwan companies investing more than  100 billion there since China began landmark economic reforms in the late 1970s  drawn by a common culture and low costs 
China has extended what it views as olive branches to Taiwan in the run up to the election  including opening further sectors to Taiwanese investors  with the ultimate goal of enticing the island to accept Beijing s control 
Taiwan s government has warned against falling for China s inducements and has called on China instead to grant its own people democracy and freedom of speech  China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control 
The revised law removes several layers of bureaucracy to simplify procedures for investment from Taiwan  with the aim of encouraging more of it 
Chinese commerce ministry official Jiang Chenghua told reporters the central government  paid great attention  to protecting and encouraging Taiwan investment and it had support from the highest levels  including President Xi Jinping 
 Although the revised clauses are not many  they are of great significance and are conducive to optimizing the investment environment for Taiwan compatriots in the mainland and to further expand economic and trade exchanges and cooperation between the two sides   Jiang added 
The revision is designed to dovetail with a new foreign investor law which comes into force on Jan  1  Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said this week he wanted  our Taiwan compatriots to share the benefit of this great change  
Taiwan says China has been stepping up its efforts to sway electors and is planning an anti infiltration law to counter Chinese influence efforts  which could pass next week 
Next month s elections pit President Tsai Ing wen of the pro independence Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party against Han Kuo yu of the main opposition party the Kuomintang  which favors close ties with China

The plan comes ahead of national elections due in late April or early May  with Vucic and his ruling Serbian Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party facing weekly opposition protests and scandals involving top officials 
 We have ample room to further bolster growth which was very good  so far    Vucic said after presenting the program which the World Bank helped develop and which envisages investment of around 9 billion euros in infrastructure such as road and rail 
The rest of the investment  to be financed through borrowing  would be spent on projects including environmental protection  hospitals  schools  and measures to improve the business climate such as cutting red tape 
Under the plan  which also aims to help counter the outflow of workers to the West  public sector wages are expected to rise to an equivalent of 900 euros a month by end 2025 from 500 euros  Pensions will be increased to around 440 euros from 225 
Serbia  which is set to end 2019 with a small deficit  would finance the plan through borrowing  It plans to auction treasury bonds worth 55 billion dinars   523 million  with maturities of five and 12 years in the first quarter of 2020  and 350 million euros of euro denominated bonds with maturities ranging between two and 20 years  according to its Debt Agency calendar

TAIPEI  Reuters    Citing a letter from a young Hong Konger appealing for people  not to believe the Communists   Taiwan President Tsai Ing wen said on Sunday the island s democratic way of life was at risk from the danger China posed to Taiwan 
The months of anti government protests in Chinese ruled Hong Kong have taken centre stage in Taiwan ahead of the Jan  11 presidential and parliamentary elections  with Tsai in particular warning Taiwan would be next if it gives into Chinese pressure and accepts Beijing s rule 
Speaking at a televised presidential debate  Tsai read excerpts from a letter she said she received from a young person in Hong Kong  She did not name the person nor say when the letter was written 
Tsai read from the letter    I ask that Taiwan s people not believe the Chinese Communists  don t believe any pro Communist official  and don t fall into China s money trap   
Taiwan s people have been through their own traumas under martial law before adopting democracy and are now seeing  the end of Hong Kong   Tsai quoted the letter as saying 
Tsai said she wanted to read the letter to remind people of the significance of their vote next month 
 On Jan  11  the vote in our hands can decide whether our democratic way of life of today can continue  The whole world is watching what Taiwan will do on Jan  11  
China claims Taiwan as its own territory  to be taken under its control by force if needed  Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China  its formal name 
China says it will run Taiwan under the  one country  two systems  model   the same as used in Hong Kong   granting it a high degree of autonomy 
Tsai and her main opponent Han Kuo yu from the Kuomintang  which favors close relations with China  have both rejected this model  though Tsai has repeatedly portrayed Han as supporting it 
Han said Tsai was  deceiving  the people of Hong Kong by using their struggle to try and win votes 
 They are bleeding from fighting against China  while you are enjoying electoral gains  Your campaign is based on the blood of Hong Kong people  You are exploiting the values they uphold   he said  citing remarks from a Hong Kong student leader who later apologized for his criticism 
Han also reiterated what has become a frequent complaint  that senior members of Tsai s Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party and Tsai herself had previously been to China  accusing them of hypocrisy for denouncing a trip he made earlier this year

Tariffs on chicken and processed chicken meat  almonds  grapes  wheat  pork  and potatoes are all earmarked for reductions  in order re balance bilateral trade  the ministry said in a statement on its website 
Vietnam has emerged as one of the largest beneficiaries of the trade spat between Washington and Beijing but it is concerned that it could be U S  President Donald Trump s next target

The Southeast Asia country is at risk of being labeled a currency manipulator by the Washington because of its trade surplus with the country  a highly positive current account balance and because its central bank has been quite active in terms of net foreign exchange purchases

What is happening in Hong Kong has also put the people of Taiwan on alert and made them think that the freedom and democratic values Taiwan has must be protected with even greater strength  she added 
 Therefore  when they watch and listen to all the politicians  they pay special attention to the views and determination of these politicians or candidates on these issues   Tsai said 
 So I do not think we are using Hong Kong people to conduct the election  rather it is a process of self vigilance by the people of Taiwan after what has happened in Hong Kong

94559,316074,PGR,China says Taiwan anti infiltration bill causing  alarm  for investors,news,"BEIJING  Reuters    A proposed anti infiltration bill in Taiwan which the government says is needed to combat Chinese influence is spreading alarm amongst the Taiwanese business community in China  the Chinese government said on Wednesday 
The legislation is part of a years long effort to combat what many in Taiwan see as Chinese efforts to influence politics and the democratic process on the island  China claims Taiwan as its territory  to be brought under Beijing s control by force if necessary 
Taiwan s ruling Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  DPP  has begun a renewed push for the legislation  ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan  11  and it could be passed before the end of the year 
The draft bill prohibits anyone donating to a political party  influencing elections or otherwise seeking to sway in Taiwan politics on the instructions of or with the financial support of  infiltration sources    generally taken to mean China 
Speaking at a regular news briefing in Beijing  Zhu Fenglian  spokeswoman for China s policy making Taiwan Affairs Office said the DPP had been using such  law revisions  to incite hostility and restrict normal exchanges across the Taiwan Strait 
 In fact for Taiwan s people  especially Taiwanese businessmen and students  it has already caused alarm and panic that everyone is treated as an enemy   she added  referring to Taiwanese in China 
No matter how their tactics change  the DPP s aim is to intimidate and punish Taiwanese people who participate in exchanges across the Taiwan Strait  Zhu said 
 They are trying to use this for political gain  but they will neither succeed nor enjoy popular support  
China  with its 1 3 billion people  is Taiwan s favorite investment destination with Taiwan companies investing over  100 billion there in total  private estimates show 
Taiwan s main opposition party the Kuomintang  which favors close ties with China  has also condemned the proposed legislation  saying it is a  political tool  of President Tsai Ing wen and her DPP to gain votes while trying to paint them as Chinese Communist Party agents 
Tsai and the DPP have repeatedly said the threat they face from China s disinformation and meddling is real

SAN JUAN  Reuters    Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez  who had said she was reluctant to take power after her predecessor resigned in disgrace this past summer  on Monday declared her candidacy for the same office in next year s elections 
Vazquez was sworn in as governor in August when widespread protests led to the resignation of Gov  Ricardo Rossello  who was caught up in a scandal over profane chat messages and federal corruption charges against two officials of his administration  
Vazquez  who served as justice secretary and was in line to succeed Rossello  was also targeted by protesters for alleged corruption and being too close to Rossello

Vazquez will run under the pro statehood New Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  She will face Pedro Pierluisi  a former representative of the commonwealth in the U S  Congress 
Rossello tapped Pierluisi in late July to become his successor  But Pierluisi was forced out of office a few days later by the territory s Supreme Court  which ruled the selection was unconstitutional

TAIPEI  Reuters    What Communist Party rulers in China fear the most is Taiwan s democracy  President Tsai Ing wen said on Wednesday  describing Beijing as a threat seeking every day to undermine Taiwan and criticizing her main opponent for being too close to China 
Tsai  who faces re election on Jan  11  has repeatedly warned of the danger posed to self ruled Taiwan by China  which claims the island as its own territory to be brought under Beijing s control by force if needed  a message Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated in January 
Taipei Beijing relations have soured since Tsai won office in 2016  with China believing she is moving toward a formal declaration of independence for the island  Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent nation  called the Republic of China  Taiwan s official name 
In a live televised pre election policy address by the three presidential candidates   a debate comes later this month   Tsai accused the main opposition party  the Kuomintang  of cosying up to China  pointing to presidential hopeful Han Kuo yu s meeting with senior Chinese officials earlier this year 
 What China fears the most is the unity of Taiwan s people  What China fears the most is Taiwan s democracy   Tsai said   We must be aware that China is infiltrating and dividing Taiwan s society in an all round way  
Referring to the anti government protests in Chinese ruled Hong Kong  Tsai said that Taiwan cannot accept  one country  two systems   the method Beijing uses to rule the city which is meant to grant a high degree of autonomy and which China hopes eventually to apply to Taiwan 
 The situation in Hong Kong makes it very clear to all of us that democracy and authoritarianism are in conflict  The two systems cannot coexist in one country   she said 
Han  trailing in the polls  said Tsai was being unfair trying to brand him as selling out Taiwan for China  and pointed out she and some of her own senior colleagues had themselves been previously to China to meet top Chinese officials 
 Who dares to say that your team does not love Taiwan   Han  currently the mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung  said  adding his trip was to try to promote Taiwan agricultural exports to China and attract Chinese tourists 
 Why can you go and it s not selling out Taiwan s sovereignty  but when I go it is   he added

wine caves became the center of a spat as seven Democratic U S  presidential contenders squared off in Los Angeles on Thursday for the final televised debate of the year   After a policy heavy first hour  in which the candidates offered their different takes on issues including taxes and trade  the sparring became more pointed and personal  Here are some of the top moments from the candidates seeking their party s nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in November 2020   DID IT CORRUPT YOU    In the night s most explosive exchange  South Bend  Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren argued over fundraising  with the senator from Massachusetts accusing the mayor of being influenced by wealthy donors   The mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served a  900 a bottle wine   Warren said   Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the president of the United States    Buttigieg has repeatedly raised more money than Warren  who swore off all fundraising events and has been critical of any of her opponents who continue to hold fundraisers   Buttigieg argued Democrats need to embrace  not snub  wealthy donors to help defeat Trump   Then things turned personal    This is about issuing purity tests that you yourself cannot pass   Buttigieg said  pointing out he has the smallest net worth of all the candidates   Senator  your net worth is 100 times mine    Warren shot back    I do not sell access to my time   she said   I don t do call time with millionaires and billionaires  I don t meet behind closed doors with big dollar donors    Buttigieg pointed out that as recently as last year  however  Warren did hold fundraisers    Did it corrupt you  Of course not   he said   These purity tests shrink the stakes of the most important election    The two seemed ready to keep going until U S  Senator Amy Klobuchar interjected    I did not come here to listen to this argument   she said   TRADE DEAL DRAWS SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION Divisions also emerged over a new North American trade deal approved by the U S  House of Representatives on Thursday  Progressive  NYSE PGR  Senator Bernie Sanders said he opposed the pact  while moderate Klobuchar said she would vote for it   The House approved the United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA  with bipartisan support  Trump declared victory after its House passage  while Democratic leaders said it was an improvement over the current North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  because it granted improved rights for workers  Sanders reminded the audience that he also voted against NAFTA  unlike some other candidates on stage  The senator from Vermont said while the new trade deal was a modest improvement over NAFTA  it would not stop U S  companies outsourcing American jobs overseas    It is not going to stop corporations going to Mexico   Sanders said   What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers  stands up for farmers   Sanders added that the new deal never mentioned climate change  which he called an  outrage   When the deal reaches the Senate  Sanders said he will not vote for it  Klobuchar  from Minnesota  said she would be voting for it   I believe we have change with this agreement   she said  adding that it contained improved labor and environmental standards  After the debate  a spokeswoman for Biden said he also supports the USMCA deal  CHINA  Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden took on China  criticizing the authoritarian country s actions against Democracy protesters in Hong Kong and Muslim Uighurs   Buttigieg decried the  use of technology for the perfection of dictatorship  and warned that if elected president  he would lead a worldwide boycott of China if the regime resorted to the bloody tactics against pro democracy protesters in Hong Kong that is used more than 30 years ago against protesters in Beijing    The message I will send is if they perpetrate a repeat of anything like Tiananmen Square  NYSE SQ  when it comes to Hong Kong  they will be isolated from the free world and we will lead that isolation both diplomatically and economically   said Buttigieg  who said he would consider boycotting the 2020 Olympics set for Beijing  Biden said he would call for sanctions against China for its internment of Muslim Uighurs and would send  60  of our sea power to that part of the world  as a show of force  while building alliances with other Asian countries to further pressure China    We have to make it clear   This is as far as you go  China    he said  But Steyer rejected the idea of isolating China  saying the United States would have to continue to work with the economic and political powerhouse   We can t isolate ourselves from China   he said   We have to work with them as a frenemy    GET THINGS DONE  Biden fused his regular plea that Democrats seek to unify the country after Trump leaves office with a response defending his son against continued attacks by Republicans   I refuse to accept the notion as some on this stage do that we can never  never get to a place where we have cooperation again   Biden said   If that s the case  we are dead as a country   Attacks against Biden and his son Hunter are at the core of the accusation against Trump that led to the House impeaching him on Wednesday  Trump asked Ukraine s president to investigate the Bidens  which the House argues was an abuse of power   If anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate  it s me  They have attacked me and my son and my family  I have no love   Biden said   But the fact is  we have to be able to get things done   GIFT OR FORGIVENESS  In a nod to the holiday season  the candidates were asked if there was a fellow candidate on stage from whom they would ask for forgiveness  or a candidate to whom they would like to give a gift  Entrepreneur Andrew Yang  the first to answer  was speechless for 10 seconds before laughing nervously  Eventually  he said Warren had done him the honor of starting to read his book and said   I would love to give each of you a copy of my book   Sanders later joked he could give all four of his books  Warren looked slightly emotional when giving her answer   I will ask for forgiveness   she said   I know sometimes I get really worked up  sometimes I get a little hot  What happens is if you do 100 000 selfies with people  you hear a lot of stories about people who are really down to their last moments   Klobuchar also asked for forgiveness  any time any of you get mad at me   
 I can be blunt  but I am doing this because I think it s so important to pick the right candidate here   she said ",2019-12-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/on-trade-and-taxes-us-democratic-presidential-rivals-offer-differing-views-2045619,2045619

Smer has seen a slide in support since last year s murder of an investigative journalist and his fiancee that triggered mass protests over corruption and ousted long time prime minister Robert Fico 
But his ruling coalition has survived  let by his hand picked successor Peter Pellegrini  and the socially conservative Smer remains favorite for next year s election 
Opinion polls put at least three opposition parties just above the 5  threshold needed to get into parliament  A possible union with stronger opposition parties would increase their chances  but such a broad coalition of socially liberal and conservative groups would be volatile 
Former president and leader of a new centrist party For the People Andrej Kiska was the first to announce the failure of the negotiations on Thursday 
 Coalitions make sense only if the support for such coalitions would be higher than the combined support for individual parties   he told reporters  adding that some voters might see such a disparate grouping as unconvincing

Opposition parties and voters fighting what they saw as tainted system got a huge boost with the victory of a liberal  pro EU lawyer  Zuzana Caputova  in the presidential election last year but it is far from clear this can be repeated in the parliamentary election 
The opposition has ruled out cooperation with Smer or its junior coalition partners  while all parties including Smer have ruled out a coalition with the far right People s Party Our Slovakia  currently the third or fourth strongest group in polls

TAIPEI  Reuters    New allegations Beijing tried to infiltrate Taiwan s democracy roiled election campaigning on the island this weekend  with President Tsai Ing wen s main opponent saying he would drop out if he had taken money from China s Communist Party 
A Chinese defector  named as Wang  William  Liqiang by Australian media  gave a sworn statement to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation  or ASIO  about Beijing s efforts to influence politics in Taiwan  Hong Kong and Australia 
In particular  Wang said he helped guide positive media attention toward certain Taiwanese politicians  including Tsai s top challenger  Han Kuo yu from the China friendly Kuomintang party  China  in a late night statement on Saturday  said Wang is a convicted fraudster who traveled on fake documents 
Taiwan  claimed by China as its sacred territory to be brought under Beijing s control by force if needed  is already on high alert for Chinese attempts to sway presidential and legislative elections scheduled for Jan  11  whether through disinformation campaigns or military intimidation 
The details about what China is suspected of doing in Taiwan quickly provoked strong reaction from both Han and his party and Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  DPP   which supports Taiwan s formal independence  a red line for Beijing 
Speaking on a campaign stop in eastern Taiwan on Saturday  Tsai said China s  shadow  was becoming more and more obvious 
Taiwan must not let China destroy its democratic values  she added 
DPP Chairman Cho Jung tai  writing on his Facebook  NASDAQ FB  page  said the Kuomintang was teaming up with the Chinese Communist Party against Taiwan and urged people to use their vote wisely 
 Will one ballot decide whether Taiwan wants to go into totalitarian China with the Kuomintang   Cho wrote 
The Kuomintang called the reports in the Australian media  quite sensational   adding it hoped the government did not use this to  play the fear of the communist s card  
Han told reporters he had doubts about what the defector was claiming  asking how the Kuomintang lost the last presidential election in 2016 if China really was swaying elections 
If he had taken money from China s Communist Party  Han vowed to resign from his post as mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung  to which he was elected a year ago 
 In this year s presidential election  if Han Kuo yu has taken even one cent  he will immediately drop out of the race   Han told reporters  adding he needed more information 
 Can Mr  Wang please come directly to Taiwan  and not hide overseas  
China s Taiwan Affairs Office  in a statement to Taiwanese media  said Beijing was not intervening in Taiwan s election  and called accusations to the contrary  nonsense  
Taiwan s government says it is investigating Wang s claims  and is asking Australia to provide further information

94593,316108,PGR,Taiwan presidential challenger s wife skips Singapore after being told no campaigning,news,"TAIPEI  Reuters    The wife of Taiwan s main opposition candidate in a presidential election has canceled a campaigning trip to Singapore after the government said it did not permit  foreign political activities  
Singapore  like most countries  has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan  which China claims as its own territory and simply a province with no right to foreign relations 
But Singapore does have close informal ties with Taiwan  including militarily  and was the site in 2015 for a landmark meeting between China s President Xi Jinping and Taiwan s then president  Ma Ying jeou 
Lee Chia fen  the wife of Han Kuo yu from Taiwan s Kuomintang party  which favors close ties with China  had been due in Singapore this week to stump for support for her husband from Taiwanese electors in the island state  Media in Singapore estimate there are around 50 000 Taiwanese living there 
The Kuomintang said on Tuesday that her trip had been called off altogether  having already said on Monday that it had canceled what would have been a rare high profile overseas election event after Singapore s government had expressed concern about security 
Singapore s Foreign Ministry  responding to what it called questions  regarding reports on the cancellation of a visit to Singapore by the spouse of a politician from Taiwan   said foreign political activities were not allowed 
 The government does not permit the conduct of foreign political activities  including campaigning and fund raising  in Singapore  We have consistently maintained the same policy for all parties   it said in a statement 
 We expect all residents and visitors to respect and abide by our laws  
However  other countries in the region which also have large Taiwanese business communities have welcomed Lee  including Cambodia  a close Chinese ally that does not even permit Taiwan to have a representative office there 
Lee has also been to Vietnam and Japan to drum up support  and is now in Malaysia  Her husband is far behind in opinion polls 
The Kuomintang  which used to rule China until it was forced to flee to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists  says it wants to improve relations with Beijing 
Han this month called for a return to a consensus with Beijing that there is only one China  but rejected China s formula for Hong Kong style  one nation  two systems  unification 
China has also previously allowed the Kuomintang to conduct low key campaigning amongst the large Taiwanese business community in China  hoping they will go home to vote and usher in a government more well disposed toward Beijing

The allegations by the self professed spy Wang Liqiang  reported by Australian media  have rocked Taiwan  after he detailed Chinese efforts to meddle in Taiwan elections and promote Communist Party influence in Hong Kong 
Taiwan President Tsai Ing wen and her Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  DPP  have seized on the accusations to warn of the threat from China  which considers Taiwan to be sacred Chinese territory to be brought under Beijing s rule by force if necessary 
China has already branded Wang a fraud and said it was nonsense to suggest it was interfering in Taiwan s January presidential and parliamentary elections  On Wednesday  the government doubled down on that criticism with its strongest words so far 
Speaking at a regular news briefing  Zhu Fenglian  spokeswoman for China s Taiwan Affairs Office  reiterated that Wang was a fraudster who carried fake travel documents 
 Actually the facts are clear for this  fraud who become a spy   This is a totally absurd  loophole ridden  screenplay  concocted by anti China forces   she said 
 The DPP authorities and the fraudster have bandied together  wantonly carrying out political manipulation   Zhu said 
 Their intention is to create the illusion of the mainland getting involved in the Taiwan regional elections and obtain improper election benefit for themselves  
Among several allegations leveled  Wang said he had helped guide positive media attention toward certain Taiwanese politicians  including President Tsai s main opponent  Han Kuo yu of the opposition Kuomintang party  which favors close ties with China 
Han  who has said he would drop out of the election if he had taken any money from the Communist Party  said on Tuesday he would sue Wang if he ever came to Taiwan

TAIPEI  Reuters    Taiwan s central bank has instructed two major foreign exchange banks on the island to bring in more U S  dollars before the end of the year to prepare for increased demand in case of political uncertainty in January elections  two sources told Reuters 
Taiwan holds presidential and legislative votes on Jan  11 
Opinion polls put President Tsai Ing wen of the pro independence Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party far ahead of her main opponent Han Kuo yu from the Kuomintang party  which favors close ties with China 
China claims Taiwan as its sacred territory to be brought under Beijing s control by force if necessary  and pays close attention to elections on the island 
Beijing has in the past menaced Taiwan with war games to try and influence people not to vote for candidates viewed as pro Taiwan independence  though such efforts have tended to backfire 
Two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters that Taiwan s central bank has instructed Mega Commercial Bank and Bank of Taiwan to import physical dollar bills    30 million for Mega and  25 million for Bank of Taiwan 
The two banks declined to comment 
A Taiwan central bank official said it was normal to ask banks to ensure they had ample U S  dollars ahead of elections 
The sources added that the import volume was less than the last presidential election in 2016  as the central bank assessed that the banks  dollar cash reserves were still abundant 
Taiwan usually stocks sufficient dollars ahead of elections to ensure it can meet demand if there is tension or political uncertainty with China  in case Taiwanese have to leave the island fast or the currency plunges in the event of a crisis

The legislation is part of a years long effort to combat what many in Taiwan see as Chinese efforts to influence politics and the democratic process on the island  China claims Taiwan as its territory  to be brought under Beijing s control by force if necessary 
The ruling Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party has begun a renewed push for the legislation this week  ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan  11 
They say there is extra urgency following allegations from a Chinese asylum seeker in Australia  Wang Liqiang  who told media there he was a spy who had worked to spread Communist Party influence in Hong Kong and meddle in Taiwan politics 
Chiu Chui cheng  deputy head of Taiwan s Mainland Affairs Council  said China s infiltration and interference in Taiwan was  extremely severe  
Other democracies take legal steps to stop such activities  and Taiwan must do so too  especially due to  China s unwillingness to give up on annexing Taiwan  while using Taiwan s free and open environment to create division within society   Chiu told reporters 
 We are right at the frontline of external threats and thus have an even more urgent need to strengthen the legal system to safeguard national security and the future of freedom and democracy  
China has denied meddling in Taiwan  and says supposed spy Wang is a convicted fraudster who has made  absurd  claims

As Taiwan s presidential elections approach in January  China has stepped up a campaign to  reunify  with what it considers a wayward province  wooing away the island s few diplomatic allies and flying regular bomber patrols around it 
And President Xi Jinping said in January that China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control but will strive to achieve peaceful  reunification  
Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told Reuters last week that China could attack the democratic and self ruled island if
any threat to China s ruling Communist Party arises from social pressures that could result from any slowdown in the world s second largest economy amid a trade war with the United States 
Ma Xiaoguang  spokesman for China s Taiwan Affairs Office  told a regular news conference in Beijing that Wu s comments were  complete nonsense and absolute rubbish  
 Recently  in order to seek benefit for the elections  they have been weaving various lies to intimidate  threaten and mislead the people of Taiwan   he added 
 I think compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait must be highly vigilant and not easily misled  
China s economy is fine  Ma said 
 Under the current complicated economic situation  the mainland s economic development landscape is still good  and this is not something the likes of Joseph Wu can talk down  
China s economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30 year low this year  putting the onus on Beijing to step up stimulus needed to sustain growth 
Ma said China wants  peaceful reunification   while Taiwan s ruling Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party is the real greatest threat to peace  pushing independence and inciting enmity 
Taiwan was trying to  cover up  the island s own economic problems  Ma added 
Taiwan s economy grew at its fastest pace in more than a year in the third quarter  as a rebound in demand for tech products for the year end peak season boosted manufacturers and  offset  the impact of trade disputes

William Lai  premier until January when he stepped down to take responsibility for a crushing defeat in regional elections last November for the ruling Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  will be Tsai s vice president candidate  she told a news conference in Taipei on Sunday 
In April last year  while still premier  Lai told parliament he was a  Taiwan independence worker  and that his position was that Taiwan was a sovereign  independent country 
China s influential Global Times tabloid responded by saying China should issue an international arrest warrant for him to face prosecution under the country s 2005 Anti Secession Law 
Accepting Tsai s nomination  Lai made no mention of independence  but said the island had to stand up to pressure from an encroaching China and  show the way  for Chinese ruled Hong Kong  which has seen months of anti government protests

China on Sunday sailed an aircraft carrier group through the sensitive Taiwan Strait  the same day Tsai announced her running mate  former premier William Lai  who has angered Beijing with his pro independence comments  Taiwan denounced the carrier sailing as attempt to intimidate voters 
China fears Tsai and her Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party will push for Taiwan s formal independence  a red line for Beijing which in 2005 enacted an  anti secession law  that allows it to use force on Taiwan in extreme cases 
Tsai  speaking after formally registering to run for re election in the Jan  11 vote  said the vote was happening at a crucial time  as China s pressure grows and against the backdrop of anti government protests in Chinese run Hong Kong 
 Our Republic of China  Taiwan  is a country  a sovereign  independent country  Our people have the right to choose their own president   she told reporters  referring to Taiwan by its official name

94618,316133,PGR,Where Democratic presidential candidates stand on  Medicare for All  ahead of next debate,news,"By Joseph Ax  Reuters    Perhaps no issue has divided the field of Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls more than the debate over  Medicare for All   Progressive  NYSE PGR  candidates favor the sweeping proposal  which would replace private health insurance with a single government run plan  More moderate candidates have embraced less drastic measures they say would achieve universal healthcare coverage while allowing individuals to choose their plan  Here is where each of the 10 Democrats who have qualified for Wednesday s debate in Atlanta stand on Medicare for All  MEDICARE FOR ALL OR BUST Bernie Sanders The U S  senator from Vermont authored Medicare for All legislation that would essentially abolish private insurance in favor of a single government run plan that covers every American  The ambitious proposal would cost more than  30 trillion over 10 years  according to independent analyses  Sanders has acknowledged he would impose higher taxes on families to help pay for the program  but has argued that the typical middle class family would save overall by eliminating virtually all health expenses  The bill would transform Medicare   now primarily for Americans aged 65 and over   into a universal system and ban employers from offering healthcare plans to compete with the government  Aside from prescription drugs  patients would face no out of pocket costs when accessing medical services  Several Democratic rivals  including former Vice President Joe Biden  have criticized Sanders  plan as unrealistic  Elizabeth Warren Warren  a U S  senator from Massachusetts  has endorsed Sanders  proposal  Unlike Sanders  who has not explained specifically how he would pay for the plan  Warren has released a detailed financing proposal  Warren has estimated Medicare for All would cost  20 5 trillion in additional government spending over 10 years  That is lower than what independent analyses have found  but Warren has argued that she would achieve savings by lowering administrative costs and reducing drug prices  among other changes  She would rely on tax increases for corporations and the wealthy  most notably billionaires  and said the plan would not raise taxes for middle class families  one penny   The proposal was met with skepticism by several of her Democratic rivals  including Biden  whose campaign accused her of engaging in dishonest  mathematical gymnastics   Warren said she would transition to Medicare for All gradually over three years  including initial legislation to make Medicare available to all Americans while preserving existing employer based insurance at first  PREFERRING A PUBLIC OPTION Joe Biden The No  2 to former Democratic President Barack Obama has criticized Medicare for All as an effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act  ACA   Obama s signature healthcare law  Instead  Biden has vowed to  build on  the ACA  popularly known as Obamacare  by adding a public option that would leave the current private insurance system in place  His healthcare plan  estimated to cost  750 billion over 10 years and paid for partly by higher taxes on the wealthy  would let people enroll in a paid government healthcare plan as an alternative to private insurance  The government plan would be modeled on Medicare and available even to workers with employer provided policies  The proposal would also expand the ACA s subsidies for private policies  making them more generous and extending them to more people  Pete Buttigieg Like Biden  Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Indiana  favors a public option  which would allow individuals to opt into a government plan but would preserve the existing role for private insurers  Buttigieg  who has coined the phrase  Medicare for all who want it  to describe the concept  has argued that a public option will eventually lead to a single payer system  because individuals will find that Medicare is more cost efficient than private policies  Amy Klobuchar Unlike other fellow senators seeking the Democratic presidential nomination  Klobuchar did not co sponsor Sanders  Medicare for All legislation  Klobuchar  a moderate from Minnesota  has said she would improve on the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option  giving people the chance to choose a government backed plan  She has criticized Medicare for All as a  pipe dream   Tom Steyer Steyer  a billionaire turned Democratic mega donor who entered the race in July  has said he favors a public option that would allow Americans to choose a government backed plan  STAKING OUT A MIDDLE GROUND Kamala Harris For months  the U S  senator from California   an original co sponsor of Sanders  Medicare for All legislation   struggled to clarify whether she would eliminate private insurance in favor of a single payer health plan  as the Sanders bill envisions  On at least two occasions  she appeared to answer in the affirmative before walking back her statements  Harris has since released her own Medicare for All plan  which stands somewhere between the sweeping Sanders proposal and more moderate alternatives  Under Harris  proposal  all Americans would be covered by Medicare  but private insurers would continue to play a role by offering plans within the Medicare system similar to the current Medicare Advantage program that allows recipients to choose private insurance plans that offer extra benefits  Her plan sets out a 10 year period to phase in the new system  unlike Sanders  goal of four years  Harris has said she would use a mix of new taxes on the wealthy and corporations to finance her plan  although she has not offered a precise price tag  Andrew Yang Yang  an entrepreneur  supports the concept of Medicare for All  arguing that the prevailing job based insurance system discourages businesses from hiring due to ever rising costs  while forcing people to stay in jobs they dislike for fear of losing their healthcare coverage  He has said he would not ban private insurers but does not believe they would be able to compete with a no cost government plan

94619,316134,PGR,Healthcare battles in Democratic White House race could carry risk in 2020  polls show,news,"By Joseph Ax and Amanda Becker NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    A trio of polls released ahead of Wednesday s Democratic presidential debate showed a majority of Americans support Medicare for All  but offered conflicting signals about whether the proposed healthcare overhaul could hurt the party in the November 2020 general election  As with the previous four debates  Wednesday s televised clash in Atlanta is likely to be dominated by the intra party battle over how best to expand healthcare coverage to millions of Americans  U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren  who has emerged as a top contender to challenge Republican President Donald Trump  has faced criticism from moderate rivals including former Vice President Joe Biden over her Medicare for All proposal  which would eventually eliminate most private insurance in favor of a government run plan  In polling data made public on Wednesday  the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation found 53  of Americans favored Medicare for All  However  two thirds approved of a  public option  plan like that proposed by Biden  Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend  Indiana  and other moderate candidates  which would offer a government plan to compete with private insurance rather than replace it  The nonprofit Progressive  NYSE PGR  Change Institute  whose political arm  the Progressive Change Campaign Coalition  PCCC   has endorsed Warren  on Tuesday released its own poll along with the nonprofit groups Public Citizen and Business for Medicare for All  It showed that 66  of registered voters nationally   and 63  in political battleground states   support Medicare for All  The dueling data reflects the extent to which many Americans are still fuzzy on Medicare for All s details  some strategists said  Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in 2018 powered by victories in moderate districts that were largely credited to the party s disciplined messaging on healthcare  Democratic candidates focused on Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act  thereby eliminating protections for people with pre existing medical conditions   That contrast has largely faded from the presidential campaign trail  overshadowed by an extended back and forth over Medicare for All and its feasibility  Warren was attacked at the last debate for refusing to say whether her proposal would raise middle class taxes  She has since issued a detailed plan asserting the overhaul can be paid for by taxing corporations and the wealthy alone while driving down costs  Her rivals have responded by saying that her assumptions are unrealistic   It s a little bit of a mystery to me why Democrats want to carve themselves up over health care  an issue they have a big advantage on   said Drew Altman  president and chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation  Some party leaders  including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  have warned that the focus on Medicare for All could cost Democrats with swing voters next year  A separate Kaiser survey released on Tuesday of voters in the presidential battleground states of Pennsylvania  Wisconsin  Michigan and Minnesota found that more than 60  of swing voters view eliminating private insurance as a bad idea

94620,316135,PGR,China says Taiwan courting  disaster  after election independence comment,news,"TAIPEI  Reuters    The Chinese government warned self ruled Taiwan on Thursday that it was courting  disaster   after the running mate for President Tsai Ing wen in January elections said he was working toward the island s independence  a red line for Beijing 
Tsai chose former premier William Lai as her vice presidential candidate on Sunday  the same day China sailed an aircraft carrier group through the sensitive Taiwan Strait  a move Taipei denounced as attempted intimidation 
The issue of Taiwan s formal independence has shot into the election spotlight since Lai joined with Tsai 
Their Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  DPP  is in favor of formal independence  But Tsai has said she is not looking to change the status quo with China  in which Taiwan seeks neither formal independence nor to be part of the People s Republic of China 
In April last year  while premier  Lai told parliament he was a  Taiwan independence worker  and that his position was that Taiwan was a sovereign  independent country 
China s nationalistic Global Times tabloid responded by saying China should issue an international arrest warrant for him to face prosecution under the country s 2005 Anti Secession Law  China considers Taiwan its territory  to be taken by force if necessary 
In a Facebook  NASDAQ FB  post on Monday  Lai repeated that he was a  realistic worker for Taiwan independence   noting that Taiwan was already a sovereign nation called the Republic of China  its official name  and not  attached  to mainland China 
Responding to a question on those remarks  China s Taiwan Affairs Office said both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China  and that the country s  reunification  is not something any force can stop 
  Taiwan independence  is a dead end  and it will only bring profound disaster to Taiwan  It will surely be opposed by all Chinese people  including Taiwan compatriots   it added 
Tsai  asked on Tuesday after formally registering her candidacy whether she supported formal Taiwan independence  said that it was a question she had addressed before and that the Republic of China on Taiwan was already a sovereign  independent nation 
Tsai s main opponent  Han Kuo yu of the China friendly Kuomintang party  has described formal independence as being worse than syphilis 
He said this week that Tsai and Lai s remarks on Taiwan already being an independent state is equivalent to a  backdoor listing  for formal independence 
Although the DPP is not technically campaigning on a promise to officially declare an independent Republic of Taiwan  some of its politicians are more explicit

With Prime Minister Boris Johnson s government facing gridlock over Brexit  political parties are gearing up for an early general election sometime in the fall  At the last national ballot in 2017  the party s relentless focus on domestic policies and reforming the economy contributed to a stronger than expected showing that cost the Conservative Party its majority

Expanding it to cover the three areas Labour is considering would generate an additional  2 1bn in revenue for the Exchequer  according to the report 
 We need to move beyond a world dominated by fast finance   McDonnell said in a separate statement 
But Stephen Jones  chief executive of U K  Finance  said the plan would hit savers  homeowners and small businesses

TAIPEI  Reuters    More than 100 000 people thronged the streets of Taiwan s capital Taipei on Saturday for East Asia s largest Pride march  months after the self ruled island began formally allowing same sex marriage  the first place in Asia to do so 
Proudly democratic Taiwan is a bastion of liberal values in a part of the world where in many countries homosexuality remains illegal 
Since legalization on May 24  more than 2 150 same sex couples have married in Taiwan  government data shows 
Organizers say more than 200 000 people are marching through the streets of Taipei  in a parade that will end in the evening outside the Presidential Office 
Chi Chia wei  an activist who brought a case to Taiwan s constitutional court that led to a landmark court ruling on same sex marriage in 2017  told Reuters that everyone was extremely happy 
 We used to be worried and fearful  but we have accomplished it  so we are all joining the Pride parade with joy   he said while standing on a balcony waving a big rainbow flag to the crowds below

94644,316159,PGR,Slovak parliament toughens pre election polling rules before February vote,news,"BRATISLAVA  Reuters    Slovakia s ruling leftist Smer party pushed a bill through parliament on Monday extending a ban on opinion polls to 50 days before elections  one of the longest periods in the world 
The move  coming before a planned election next February  has drawn strong criticism from opposition parties and political experts who view it as an attempt to silence challengers from new parties 
Slovakia  like other countries in Europe  has seen a rise in new parties in recent years  Most notably  newcomer activist lawyer Zuzana Caputova defeated Smer s preferred candidate in a presidential runoff in March 
The new bill was backed by Smer and one of its two ruling coalition partners  the center right Slovak National Party  SNS   as well as opposition far right People s Party Our Slovakia 
It will extend the ban on publishing polls from 14 days  which was already the second longest ban of pre election poll releases in Europe  Among others in the world  only Cameroon and Tunisia have a longer blackout period 
The bill s authors  from Smer and SNS  said they aimed to protect voters from disinformation so they can base their decisions on the parties  programs and activities 
 Political parties use opinion polls to influence public opinions  confusing voters   the bill said 
The longer blackout on polls is the second amendment to election rules this year  In June  the government rushed through legislation tightening campaign financing rules 
In a statement last month  sociologists at the Slovak Academy of Sciences criticized the polling bill as a  violation of the freedom of speech that gives unfair advantage to political parties   that would still be able to order opinion polls without publishing them  
The socially conservative Smer party  in power nearly continuously since 2006  remains the favorite for next year s election 
It stood at 22  support in a Focus poll on Sunday  followed by Progressive  NYSE PGR  Slovakia Together at 11 0  and far right People s Party Our Slovakia at 10 2   Of the nine parties that would make it to the parliament  four were sitting just above the 5  threshold 
But Smer has suffered election defeats since the 2018 murder of Jan Kuciak  a journalist who investigated high level graft cases  and his fianc e  at their home 
The killings sparked mass demonstrations against the perceived impunity to corruption  The protests forced longtime Smer leader Robert Fico to resign as prime minister  He was replaced by party ally Peter Pellegrini ",2019-10-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/slovak-parliament-toughens-preelection-polling-rules-before-february-vote-2005929,2005929
94645,316160,PGR,U S  China tensions spur progress on giant Asia trade pact,news,"By Patpicha Tanakasempipat and Matthew Tostevin BANGKOK  Reuters    Tensions between the United States and China have given new impetus to a China backed trade pact and there is a chance of major progress  if not final agreement  when Southeast Asian leaders meet in Bangkok this week  analysts say  The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership  RCEP  could become the world s largest free trade zone  comprising 16 countries that account for a third of global gross domestic product and nearly half the world s population   Progress since talks began in 2012 has been slowed by disagreements between members  such as major Indian concerns over a possible deluge of imports from China  The pact also includes the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN   Australia  Japan  New Zealand and South Korea  Analysts said the pace of discussion on remaining issues had quickened this year  as the U S  China trade war sharpened concerns over both economic growth and regional security   We are hearing that there is light at the end of the tunnel and it is already a short tunnel   said Tang Siew Mun  head of the ASEAN Studies Centre at the Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore    The momentum is now there for the politicians to get this done   he told Reuters  Thailand  which currently chairs ASEAN  said this month market access talks were 80 4  complete and members had agreed on 14 of a total of 20 chapters  Talks with RCEP members will follow the ASEAN summit  from Oct  31 to Nov  4  in Bangkok   Some Southeast Asian nations would like to show that they can keep the regional integration show on the road  despite the U S  China tensions   said Benjamin Bland  director of the Southeast Asia project at the Lowy Institute in Sydney  In Asia  China is not alone in feeling the pressure of the trade war  Although some companies have moved production from China to escape U S  tariffs  the International Monetary Fund  IMF  forecasts growth in ASEAN s top five economies will fall to 4 8  this year from 5 3  in 2018  It expects India s growth to slow to 6 1  from 6 8   Countries that used to rely on the United States as a counterweight to China s growing regional dominance are also increasingly doubtful if they can  RCEP members including India  Japan  Malaysia  South Korea and Thailand all have large trade surpluses with the United States   a bugbear for President Donald Trump  U S  Thai trade relations have been strained  with Washington withdrawing trade preferences on  1 3 billion in Thai goods last Friday  accusing Thailand of failing to protect workers  rights    WARNING SIGN   The trade tensions should be the final warning sign that Asia needs to have a collective platform and a place for engaging in economic issues   said Deborah Elms  executive director of the Asian Trade Center based in Singapore  It would be a  massive missed opportunity  if leaders did not announce the success of the pact at this week s meeting  Elms added   The RCEP trade deal aims to build on the free trade deals that Southeast Asian countries have with other members   It has been widely seen as a China supported alternative to the Comprehensive and Progressive  NYSE PGR  Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership  CPTPP   which covers 11 countries across the Pacific   though Trump pulled the United States out of talks before it was signed  RCEP  seven of whose member nations are also in the other agreement  is less ambitious in terms of the areas of trade that would be freed up and the conditions participants must meet  But it is still expected to provide a major boost to regional trade  besides being symbolically important  as the Trump administration challenges multilateral trade deals   Completing the RCEP negotiations as early as possible is of great significance to the long term stability  prosperity and development of the region   Li Chenggang  China s assistant commerce minister told reporters in Beijing on Monday   The negotiations are currently in the final sprint    Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is confirmed to attend the Bangkok meet  while the United States has yet to announce any representative more senior than Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell  Last year  U S  Vice President Mike Pence joined the meeting with Southeast Asian leaders in Trump s place   Other issues that may figure at the Southeast Asian summit include the standoff between China and several regional states over its sweeping maritime claims in the South China Sea  as well as Myanmar s treatment of Muslim Rohingya after a military crackdown drove more than 700 000 into Bangladesh in 2017  But with Thai hosts keen to show progress on the RCEP deal  analysts and diplomats say it is shaping up as the most important issue in Bangkok   ASEAN hopes to at least be able to announce that substantial progress has been made  to ensure momentum is

Sinisa Mali said the budget was based on a growth projection of 4  in 2020  up from around 3 5  this year 
Belgrade and the IMF had agreed that the spending plan for the next year would target an overall fiscal deficit of 0 5  of GDP  unchanged from this year

94647,316162,PGR,Explainer  World s biggest trade pact shapes up without India,news,"By Matthew Tostevin
BANGKOK  Reuters    Although India pulled out at the last minute  China and 14 other countries agreed in Bangkok this week on plans for what could become the world s biggest trade agreement   the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership  RCEP  
They aim to sign it next year to start freeing up trade between members that include the 10 member Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN   Japan  South Korea  Australia and New Zealand 
WHAT WILL RCEP DO 
Exact details have yet to be released  but it will progressively lower tariffs across many areas 
Its backers say that just as importantly it will let companies export the same product anywhere within the bloc without having to meet separate requirements and fill out separate paperwork for each country 
 For a goods producer it s huge   said Deborah Elms of the Asian Trade Centre   What we don t have now is a lot of Asian trade for final markets in Asia  This sets that up  
It gives an incentive for companies to build supply chains within the region even if they export outside 
The agreement also touches on services and on protecting intellectual property 
WHAT DOESN T IT DO 
RCEP is not seen as such a  high quality  trade agreement as the Comprehensive and Progressive  NYSE PGR  Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership  CPTPP   among 11 Asia Pacific countries  because it does not cover or harmonize as much 
Tariffs are agreed between countries rather than across the board  For some countries  sensitive issues such as agriculture won t be touched  It lacks provisions for liberalising state enterprises or protecting workers and the environment 
WHAT ECONOMIC IMPACT WILL IT HAVE 
Even once signed  implementation would take months to start and years to complete  The complexity makes precise calculations hard  economists say 
The 15 participating countries make up nearly a third of the world s people  it would have been nearly half with India   RCEP members account for nearly a third of global domestic product  with India s departure making less of a difference 
WHAT DOES INDIA S ABSENCE MEAN 
India can join later and other countries   notably Indonesia and Japan   have been lobbying it hard to stay  But Prime Minister Narendra Modi was emphatic about rejecting terms the other members agreed 
 While India s exit devalues the pact  it also removes the single biggest obstacle to its completion   said Anthony Nelson of consultancy Albright Stonebridge 
India s biggest concern is a wave of cheap goods from China and elsewhere  For other countries  losing India means they won t access a market that is notoriously hard to get into  but also they won t be able to include India as easily in supply chains 
Supporters of the deal argue that India will lose investment while its consumers will pay more than they should 
Southeast Asian countries also see India as a counterweight to China s growing dominance 
 It s a missed opportunity for India   said Pavida Pananond of Thammasat University in Bangkok 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR GLOBAL TRADE 
Just getting the deal done   even without India   is a boost for multilateral trade deals over the bilateral sort favored by U S  President Donald Trump 
Trump s tariff raising trade war with China gave extra impetus to push ahead with RCEP  which had progressed only sluggishly since 2012 
DOES THIS STRENGTHEN CHINA VERSUS THE US 
China is already the biggest source of imports and destination of exports for nearly all the RCEP countries 
But at a time of growing concerns over China s might  it cements its position more firmly as an economic partner with East and Southeast Asia  It will also be better placed to shape the region s trade rules 
Additional symbolism for China s rise at the expense of the United States came from the deal being agreed alongside an ASEAN summit to which Trump s administration sent a lower ranking delegation than all other countries 
In a snub to the Americans  they were met by only three of the region s leaders instead of the full group of 10 
 China measures up commendably against the U S  diplomatic faux pas and India s RCEP withdrawal   said Siew Mun Tang of the Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore ",2019-11-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/explainer-worlds-biggest-trade-pact-shapes-up-without-india-2012012,2012012

In a series of interviews with local media  Puerto Rico s former justice secretary denied reports that she had agreed to resign soon to allow Jenniffer Gonzalez  the Caribbean island s nonvoting representative in the U S  Congress  to take over 
 I have never had such agreement  I don t know what kind of agreements  New Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party and legislative leaders  have reached   Vazquez said on a morning radio show  emphasizing that she intends to remain in office for the remainder of former Governor Ricardo Rossello s term  which ends on Jan  1  2021 
On Wednesday  Vazquez became Puerto Rico s third governor in less than a week  after Rossello  who took office in 2017  stepped down on Friday  and his hand picked successor  Pedro Pierluisi  was removed by the island s supreme court 
The nine member court on Wednesday unanimously ruled that Pierluisi s assumption of the office was unconstitutional because the Puerto Rico Senate had not confirmed his July 31 appointment by Rossello as secretary of state  the post that is next in line for governor under the territory s constitution 
The high court s ruling followed weeks of political turmoil  with Rossello on July 24 announcing his intention to resign after of days of protests 
The demonstrations  which drew around a third of the island s 3 2 million people  were sparked by the revelation of offensive chat messages between Rossello and his closest allies  and federal corruption charges brought against two former members of his administration 
The chat message scandal led to the July 13 resignation of Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin  whom Rossello eventually replaced with Pierluisi 
Vazquez last week initially voiced reluctance to take over the island s top government post after being targeted by protesters for alleged corruption and being too close to Rossello 
On Thursday  Vazquez said she did not see herself as a politician  emphasizing she would not run for governor in the 2020 election  
The political upheaval comes at a critical time in Puerto Rico s bankruptcy  as it seeks billions of dollars in federal funding for healthcare and recovery efforts from devastating 2017 hurricanes 
As governor  Vazquez must deal with Puerto Rico s federally created fiscal oversight board  which filed the government s bankruptcy in 2017 in U S  District Court to restructure about  120 billion of debt and pension obligations

94660,316175,PGR,As 2020 race heats up  growing worries Warren and Sanders will split leftist vote,news,"By James Oliphant
DES MOINES  Iowa  Reuters    At rallies at the Iowa State Fair last week  2020 White House contenders Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders drew raucous crowds who chanted their names  waved signs and cheered at their every pledge 
Friends and liberal standard bearers of the Democratic Party  the two U S  senators espouse many of the same causes  universal healthcare  taking on Wall Street  and raising the minimum wage 
Both candidates also have robust  well funded campaigns and strong claims on this state  which holds the first Democratic presidential nominating contest in February 
That has some voters preoccupied with a question  is Iowa  or the presidential field in general  big enough for two popular progressives running head to head  or is there a risk that they could split the vote on the left  to the benefit of a centrist such as former vice president Joe Biden 
 Of course it concerns me   said Sherma Mather  50  who was visiting the fair from Richmond  Virginia  to support Warren 
Although the field is unsettled with the Iowa caucuses still nearly six months away  early opinion polls have consistently shown Biden in the lead with either Sanders  of Vermont  or Warren  of Massachusetts  in second place 
The fact that combining support for Sanders and Warren would eclipse Biden s buttresses progressives  arguments that the party is lurching leftward 
 They are a 1 2 punch and they are having a gravitational pull on the rest of the field   said Adam Green  co founder of the Progressive  NYSE PGR  Change Campaign Committee  PCCC   an advocacy group that supports Warren 
Two dozen Democrats are competing to secure their party s nomination and battle Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 general election 
Sanders and Warren insist they are friends  not rivals  And they have so far stayed true to their pledge not to turn on each other for political gain  as moderate candidates warn that their reformist agenda will only ensure Trump s re election 
In Iowa  which has an outsized role in picking presidential nominees  there are signs that Warren could be chipping away at some of Sanders  long held support on the left 
A recent poll by Monmouth University of Iowa Democrats showed Warren in second place with 21  of the vote  trailing Biden by just seven percentage points  Sanders had dropped to 9  in the state  according to the poll 
Advisers to Sanders on Monday said the survey was flawed on the grounds his supporters were undersampled 
Nationally  the news is better for him  with Sanders and Warren basically neck and neck behind Biden  The most recent Reuters Ipsos poll had Sanders in second place by a wide margin over Warren 
Sanders  can make a case for himself at this juncture how he is a unique candidate without denigrating others   said his campaign manager Faiz Shakir 
Warren s campaign declined to comment for this story 
Watching Sanders at the state fair on Sunday  Alexis Johnson  33  of Des Moines  said beating Trump was her top priority as a voter and expressed little enthusiasm for Warren 
 It s going to Bernie or Biden  I feel like   she said   And Bernie s my man  
Misty Cornelius  38  of Des Moines  was sporting a Sanders tattoo on her chest at the fair  but she said Warren might be a better choice against Trump 
 Bernie has been stigmatized   she said   Warren is a fresh face  
DIFFERENT APPEAL
Despite sharing many of the same talking points  the two are noticeably different on the stump 
Drawing upon her working class Oklahoma roots  Warren casts herself as a sort of prairie populist  while Sanders talks more in terms of leading a  movement  
There is evidence too that the two do not chase the same kind of voters 
Patrick Murray  the polling director at Monmouth  said while  there is ideological overlap   Warren s recent surge has her pulling support away from virtually every other candidate  not just Sanders 
 Sanders has core support that will not desert him   Murray said  That grassroots support led Sanders in 2016 to battle the eventual nominee Hillary Clinton to the very end of the primaries 
But Warren may have appeal to women  particularly college educated women  that Sanders cannot match   I am sick and tired of men running the world   said Janet Caldwell  66  of Washington  Iowa 
Sanders  campaign in fact views Biden as their primary challenge  because both are courting the kind of working class voters and union voters who gravitated to Trump in 2016 
Biden did little in Iowa to boost his status as a front runner  He made several gaffes  including when he said in a speech that  poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids    a sensitive slip up in an election where race is in the spotlight 
Also waiting in the wings in Iowa is U S  Senator Kamala Harris of California  who ranked third in the state in the Monmouth poll with 11  support 
After Iowa  Sanders and Warren will clash in New Hampshire  which holds the first Democratic primary later in February 
Many Warren voters  like Mather of Richmond  fear Sanders will not yield if his fellow senator continues to gain momentum 
Right now  the foremost concern of the two campaigns is not to siphon support off the other  Instead  they both want to convince large swaths of voters that a progressive Democrat can win the election against Trump  the PCCC s Green said 
 Many  electability voters  are parked in Joe Biden s column   Green said   but that perception is changing  ",2019-08-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/as-2020-race-heats-up-growing-worries-warren-and-sanders-will-split-leftist-vote-1953450,1953450
94661,316176,PGR,Taiwan sharply boosts defense budget amid China tension,news,"TAIPEI  Reuters    Taiwan unveiled its largest defense spending increase in more than a decade on Thursday amid rising military tensions with its giant neighbor China  which considers the self ruled island its own and has not renounced the use of force against it 
President Tsai Ing wen s cabinet signed off on an 8 3  increase in military spending for the year starting January to T 411 3 billion   13 11 billion   its largest yearly gain since 2008  according to Directorate General of Budget  Accounting and Statistics 
If approved by lawmakers  which is likely given the ruling Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party s control of parliament  it will be the highest since records started in 2001  data from the statistics agency show 
China warned in July it was ready for war if there was any move toward Taiwan s independence and denounced arms sales from the United States to Taiwan  which is among a growing number of flashpoints in the U S  China relationship including a trade war and U S  sanctions 
 To react to the enemy s threat and to ensure national security  the defense budget continues to grow stably   Taiwan s defense ministry said in a statement 
The ministry said it will spend more to purchase advanced weapons from overseas and to build a fully volunteer force after decades of conscription 
China  which suspects Tsai of pushing for the island s formal independence  has been ramping up military pressure on Taiwan  which includes encirclement drills around it and flying jets across a maritime border separating the two sides  a move Taipei called  provocative  
The United States is the main arms supplier to Taiwan and approved in July sales of weapons estimated to be worth  2 2 billion to the democratic island  Washington has no formal ties with Taipei  but it is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself

The office of President Adama Barrow  whose election in 2016 brought an end to the rule of the army officer who toppled Jawara  Yahya Jammeh  hailed the late president as  an elder statesman  and Gambia s  founding father  
A veterinarian by training  Jawara in 1959 founded the Protectorate People s Party  later rechristened the People s Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  which emerged as the dominant political force following independence from Britain in 1965

In 1970  Gambia adopted a republican constitution by referendum and Jawara was elected its first president 
Over the next two decades  he presided over a multi party political system in a region plagued by authoritarian rule and frequent civil unrest 
He drew criticism in the later years for nepotism and corruption  That helped open the door to the military coup that unseated him and which was initially welcomed by many Gambians  His reputation has risen again since the removal of Jammeh 
A statement by Barrow s office noted that Jawara was affectionately known as  Kairaba Jawara   or  Peaceful Jawara  
 Under his leadership  The Gambia became one of Africa s few successful parliamentary democracies  a champion of international peace  justice and human rights   the statement said 
The 23 year rule of Jawara s successor  Jammeh  was marked by widespread torture  killings of perceived opponents and graft  according to Barrow s administration and testimony before a truth commission it established 
Jammeh has not been reachable for comment in exile  but his supporters have dismissed accusations against him as a witch hunt  Since coming to office  Barrow has tried to restore human rights and end spats with foreign governments initiated by Jammeh ",2019-08-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/gambias-first-postindependence-president-jawara-dies-at-95-1964579,1964579

94670,316185,PGR,As China trade war escalates  2020 U S  Democrats scramble over their message,news,"By James Oliphant WASHINGTON  Reuters    The growing economic fallout from President Donald Trump s drawn out trade war with China would appear to be a ready made opportunity for Democratic presidential contenders seeking to blunt his central 2020 re election pitch  That he has made the economy great again  So far  it has not quite worked out that way  While most of the 20 Democratic presidential hopefuls vying to take on Trump in the November 2020 election have condemned his tit for tat exchange of tariffs with China for hurting farmers  consumers and businesses  they have not been of one voice on how they would handle things differently  That has led to a scrambled and sometimes incoherent message from Trump s rivals even as global markets gyrate  U S  consumer prices of Chinese imports rise and farmers lose their biggest export market as a result   It s a little tricky   said Jared Bernstein  who served as the top economic adviser to Joe Biden  the Democratic front runner  when Biden was Barack Obama s vice president   The challenge is to distance yourself from what has been a pretty disastrous set of policies from the Trump administration  while signaling you are not going to be soft on China   The Republican president has pledged to overhaul America s trade relationship with the world  reduce trade deficits and open up more markets to U S  exports  His advisers insist his projection of toughness against China will energize  not alienate  his base  But as China s retaliatory actions hit farming and manufacturing in battleground states from Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to Michigan for a second year now  Trump s China gambit looks increasingly risky going into 2020  For their part  Democrats in Congress have long been critical of China and the economic and national security threat posed by the world s second largest economy  That has left Democratic presidential candidates struggling to articulate their own get tough positions without looking like they are adopting Trump s bulldozing ways   The conflict with China has also exposed the same divisions within the party between moderates and progressives  Moderates Pete Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Indiana  and former U S  Representative Beto O Rourke  for example  would lift Trump s tariffs altogether  Progressive  NYSE PGR  U S  Senator Bernie Sanders views tariffs as a valuable weapon to bring China to heel  and fellow liberal U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren has a trade agenda that appears to be just as protectionist as that of Trump  The issue may arise again later this week when 10 Democrats will be on stage for the third presidential debate in Houston   STOLEN THUNDER  Regardless of ideology  most Democrats seeking their party s presidential nomination have been treading cautiously on China  An August poll released by the Pew Research Center showed 60  of Americans had a negative view of China  up from 47  in 2018  a sign that Trump s China bashing is having an effect   Indeed  Trump s insurgent 2016 campaign was powered in part by animus toward China and pledges to confront the Asian power  Trump exposed raw feelings about globalisation and free trade held by many voters who witnessed U S  factory jobs vanish and local economies stagnate  In doing so  he co opted a position long held by progressives such as Sanders and Warren that globalisation had benefited multinational corporations at the expense of U S  workers   Trump stole everybody s thunder on the issue   Bernstein said  Warren s recently released trade plan is not centered on tariffs  But as president  she would not support any trade deal with a nation that did not meet a host of environmental  labor and human rights criteria  a set of standards the United States itself does not yet meet and would likely exclude developing nations   There is no doubt the public is ready for an anti China message  But it has to be a smart  strategic message   said Scott Lincicome  a trade policy expert at the CATO Institute  which supports free trade  Otherwise  he said   They are ceding the turf to Trump   In that regard  it has not been easy for Democrats to establish their separate identities   The Sanders Warren message on trade at the Joe Voter level is indistinguishable from Trump s   Lincicome said  FINE LINE Biden is one candidate who has attempted to navigate a fine line  and he is viewed by U S  business concerns as perhaps the best hope for a  reset  to the pre Trump status quo   But the former vice president has been on the defensive on the subject since early in the year  when his dismissal of China s economic threat triggered criticism from Trump and Sanders  among others  Biden has since vowed to marshal U S  allies to put pressure on China to curb its anti competitive practices  and expressed sympathy for U S  farmers who have lost China as a customer  But he has not said whether he would lift all of Trump s tariffs  and his campaign would not address the question with Reuters   A spokesman for his campaign said only that Biden would  start getting tough and smart on China without throwing backbone American industries like agriculture and manufacturing under the bus   The Trump campaign has long believed Biden is vulnerable on trade because of his vote in favor of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement and his support of normalized trade relations with China as a U S  senator  As vice president  he also championed the Trans Pacific Partnership  a multi nation Pacific Rim trade deal that was designed to rein in China by bolstering other trading partners in the region but was opposed by progressives and labor unions at home  Trump pulled the United States out of the TPP after taking office in 2017  Biden has said he would support a renegotiated TPP  but would not rejoin it as it stands  He has also said he would not support Trump s U S  Mexico Canada trade pact that would replace NAFTA  unless changes are made to its labor and environmental provisions  among others   Tony Fratto  a top official at the U S  Treasury Department under Republican President George W  Bush  said Biden should take advantage of polling that shows most Americans favor free trade agreements   A July poll from Pew found 65  of Americans now favored free trade pacts with other nations   Biden could chart a course different from both Trump and Democratic liberals and appeal in the process to suburban voters who are more likely to support global trade and yearn for international stability  Fratto said  
 There are more suburban voters than union voters   he said   Biden has a natural opportunity  ",2019-09-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/as-china-trade-war-escalates-2020-us-democrats-scramble-over-their-message-1973256,1973256

China claims self ruled Taiwan as its own and has vowed to bring the island under its control  by force if necessary 
China has suggested the island could be ruled under a formula similar to Hong Kong s  one country  two systems  arrangement  which guarantees certain freedoms  but Hong Kong s protests have raised questions about the formula 
Beijing has accused Taipei of supporting the Hong Kong protests  Taiwan denies that 
In Beijing  Ma Xiaoguang  spokesman for China s Taiwan Affairs Office  said Lee was being investigated  in accordance with the law   He gave no other details 
Taiwan s Mainland Affairs Council demanded Beijing give a  full explanation   including information on Lee s whereabouts and the charge he faces

94692,316207,PGR,Venezuela Political Chaos Deepens With Third Claim to Presidency,news," Bloomberg     If Venezuelan politics weren t convoluted enough  they just got a bit more complicated this week 
The opposition aligned Progressive  NYSE PGR  Advance party hired Ari Ben Menashe  a Montreal based lobbyist  to  pursue Henri Falcon s election as President of Venezuela   according to a contract filed with the U S  Justice Department 
Days after the public filing  Falcon and his advisers are walking back the purpose of the  200 000 contract  An amended document  obtained by Bloomberg News  said their main aim is  to pursue a peaceful solution to Venezuela s economic  humanitarian and political crisis   Progressive Advance said in a press release that it was  absurd  to consider a presidential candidacy for Falcon 
The former Lara state governor didn t immediately respond to requests for comment 
Falcon lost to President Nicolas Maduro in a widely criticized election last May  That led the U S  and more than 50 governments to recognize National Assembly President Juan Guaido as the nation s rightful leader this January  when Maduro s second term began 
The lobbying effort underscores an ongoing rift within Venezuela s opposition  even as roughly four fifths of Venezuelans share a negative view of Maduro s government  Last year  the nation s main opposition bloc boycotted what it called a sham vote pitting Maduro against Falcon and televangelist Javier Bertucci 
In the contract  Progressive Advance said it s working with Ben Menashe s firm to establish contact with Washington and Moscow to seek a solution to the country s crisis  The party has proposed an oil for food program in which Venezuela could export oil to the U S  and the profits would be used exclusively to buy food for the nation  At the moment  hyperinflation makes it almost impossible for most Venezuelans to buy the food they need 
Maduro s government and opposition officials representing Guaido started negotiations in May  sponsored by Norway  seeking to find a solution to Venezuela s political and economic crisis  The most recent talks ended Wednesday in Barbados with no deal  Guaido s representatives pushed for early presidential elections  according to two lawmakers with direct knowledge of the matter ",2019-07-19,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/venezuela-political-chaos-deepens-with-third-claim-to-presidency-1929060,1929060

94700,316215,PGR,Governor resignation sparks power struggle in Puerto Rico,news,"By Nick Brown
SAN JUAN  Reuters    The resignation of Puerto Rico s governor after mass protests has sparked a succession battle  and the winner could be a Washington corporate lawyer not directly linked to his administration  which has been dogged by corruption scandals 
Governor Ricardo Rossell  said on Wednesday he would step down on Aug  2 in the face of public anger over the release of profane chat messages and embezzlement charges against two former administration officials 
In line with the U S  territory s constitution  Secretary of Justice Wanda V zquez is next in line to succeed Rossell   based on current Cabinet vacancies 
Protesters who forced Rossell  from office have vowed to oppose V zquez  saying she is too close to the disgraced governor 
That has prompted leaders of Rossell  s pro statehood party to look to a former Puerto Rico representative in the U S  Congress as a possible successor  according to four sources familiar with the matter  who asked not to be named so they could discuss it 
Pedro Pierluisi  who represented the island in Washington from 2009 to 2017  has made it clear to party leaders he would accept the job  according to one of these people 
Pierluisi  currently an attorney with Washington law firm O Neill   Borges  ran against Rossell  in the gubernatorial election in 2016  losing in a primary 
A member of Rossell  s New Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  PNP   Pierluisi could become the commonwealth s next governor if he is nominated and confirmed as secretary of state before Rossell  resigns  That post  currently vacant  is first in line to succeed the governor 
Also vying for the position is Puerto Rico Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz of the PNP  these people said 
EYES ON 2020
Foremost in the minds of party leaders is whether Rossell  s successor can help them retain the governorship when it comes up for grabs in November 2020 
Pierluisi  a former Puerto Rico secretary of justice  is favored by some Puerto Rico advocates in Washington for his familiarity with federal politics  according to one of the sources  Another of the sources said Pierluisi has stressed to party leaders that he would not seek re election in 2020  to keep the door open for Schatz  Puerto Rico s current delegate to the U S  Congress Jenniffer Gonz lez  or another candidate 
Schatz is seen by some in the party as too closely linked to Rossell  to be a viable successor or 2020 candidate  the people said 
Puerto Ricans want a leader to steer them out of crisis and economic recession after Rossell  s term was marked by back to back 2017 hurricanes that killed around 3 000 people just months after the U S  territory filed for bankruptcy 
Pierluisi had a track record of gaining increased federal funding for Puerto Rico s 3 2 million people while serving in Congress 
He also faced accusations in a 2016 New York Times report of possible conflicts of interest between legislation he introduced and financial consulting work by his wife  allegations they both denied 
Pierluisi has been named by local media as a possible successor to Rossell  since his former secretary of state stepped down in the wake of the online chat scandal 




In the chats  published on July 13  Rossell  and 11 top aides made offensive statements about female political opponents  gay pop singer Ricky Martin and ordinary Puerto Ricans ",2019-07-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/governor-resignation-sparks-power-struggle-in-puerto-rico-1936066,1936066
94704,316219,PGR,Puerto Rico s Succession Drama Shifts With Turn on Senate Vote,news," Bloomberg     Pedro Pierluisi  whose ascension to the Puerto Rico governor s office has triggered a legal fight over his legitimacy  said he would honor a Senate vote on his right to the office  the latest in a series of seemingly contradictory remarks that have caused even more chaos in a volatile succession crisis 
The question of whether it was legal for him to take over for Ricardo Rossello on Friday despite the lack of Senate approval for his position was also winding through the island s court system Monday  That s left Pierluisi in a precarious position  with the possibility he could be forced at any time to stop acting as the top executive of the U S  territory 
 If the Puerto Rican Senate decides to carry out any type of vote on my incumbency  I will respect the result of said vote   he said Monday  appearing to reverse course from statements he made over the weekend  which themselves were seen as an about face 
The dizzying developments reflected a constantly developing story playing out simultaneously in court  the halls of the local Congress and the streets of San Juan  where protesters have been active for much of the the past month and forced Rossello s resignation 
The Senate had been expected to hold a session at 3 p m  local time Monday  but not to vote on Pierluisi s  incumbency   Instead  lawmakers had been expected to weigh in on his appointment as Rossello s secretary of state  a position that is next in line to the governor  When Rossello stepped down Friday  Pierluisi took his place  even without having completed the confirmation process 
Private Ceremony
Meanwhile  Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz filed suit Sunday to force Pierluisi to  cease and desist occupying and exercising the functions of the Puerto Rican governorship   The Senate also requested a ruling on the succession framework  which could permanently undermine any remaining claim Pierluisi might have to the office  The body is asking the island s top court to take the case 
The developments are the latest in a battle that began when Rossello was forced from the governorship after chats leaked in which he disparaged average Puerto Ricans  Pierluisi  his chosen successor  was confirmed only by the local House of Representatives  Nonetheless  Pierluisi took the oath in a private ceremony at his sister s home seconds after Rossello officially stepped down 
His first remarks as  governor  were deferential to the pending Senate vote  but late on Sunday  he appeared to make the point that the Senate vote on the secretary of state nomination was moot  and that he wanted the judges to decide  His latest statements open the possibility of another type of vote in the Senate  one which would be expressly about his right to the governorship 
If the lawsuit doesn t speak for itself  Senate President Rivera Schatz has left little doubt that he opposes Pierluisi and how he s assumed the office  But the political landscape has been shifting rapidly  with old ruling party alliances fraying  Indeed  Pierluisi s nomination in the House overcame what that chamber s President Carlos  Johnny  Mendez had originally predicted to be insurmountable resistance 
Reluctant Stand In
If the Senate gets its way in court  the real governor might turn out to be Justice Secretary Wanda Vazquez  who doesn t want the job and has said she would take it only as a matter of constitutional responsibility 
The chaos is weighing on the U S  commonwealth s fragile economy  its record bankruptcy and the prospects of federal aid to rebuild from 2017 s Hurricane Maria 
All the major players in the drama    Pierluisi  Vazquez and Senate President Rivera Schatz    belong to the New Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  which many protesters thought they were ousting when they drove Rossello from office  The party dominates both chambers of the legislature and the governorship 
But Puerto Ricans say they re fed up with the status quo  under which free spending and corrupt politicians helped the island of 3 2 million amass  74 billion in debt  all the while overseeing a collapse of the economy that spurred an exodus to the mainland  They also blame the Popular Democratic Party  the main opposition  which was in power during many of the years of misspending 
It wasn t clear which replacement governor might satisfy protesters who flooded Old San Juan s cobbled streets  leaving behind graffiti reading  Pierluisi  you re next   and  No to Wanda  
Gustavo Velez  a Guaynabo economist and head of consulting firm Inteligencia Economica  said it may be early to declare the end of the establishment 
 Its legitimacy is really undermined  but at this point  there are no feasible political options  nor an effective leader to replace the traditional ones   said Velez 
Much could turn on the influence of the senate president  a New Progressive stalwart who is running for governor in 2020  Several lawmakers supported him to step in now  and some have suggested a plan is still afoot to make that happen  Rivera Schatz has said he hasn t asked anyone to give him the job 
 Enemy No  1 
In a fiery speech Thursday  he excoriated critics and blasted what he called a media conspiracy  He said that Pierluisi was  Puerto Rico s public enemy No  1  
He has also been an outspoken critic of Justice Secretary Vazquez  whose resignation he demanded last year amid an investigation into whether she improperly tried to influence a criminal case involving a break in at her daughter s home 
At the heart of the resistance to Pierluisi is his role in creating a deeply unpopular federal oversight board  which is trying to enforce austerity to help restructure the debt  As the nonvoting representative for Puerto Rico in the U S  House from 2009 to 2017  Pierluisi championed a law called Promesa that gave Puerto Rico a path to bankruptcy court but also installed the board  Then  Pierluisi worked for O Neill   Borges LLC  the board s on island law firm 
Blaming Wall Street
 He represents the financial sector that has been ruining us   said Yadira Carrasquillo  45  a U S  Army veteran among about 100 protesters in front of the governor s mansion on Sunday afternoon 
Pierluisi s critics said the work constitutes a conflict of interest  which he denies  He says he never wanted the board  but accepted it as part of a tough negotiation that brought other benefits 
The leadership crisis began July 13  when Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin  a participant in the infamous messaging group  was among the first in the administration to resign    a gesture meant to save the administration when it still seemed salvageable  Swelling street protests soon made Rossello s own job untenable ",2019-08-05,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/puerto-ricos-succession-drama-shifts-with-turn-on-senate-vote-1945925,1945925

 It s still not set in stone if I m going yet   Rendon told reporters   I ve got a lot of injuries  or little ailments that I m dealing with right now  So it s the kind of decision where I m thinking about  I may want to get my body back to 100 percent over those four days instead of actually dealing with all this  and actually not getting time to rest  So I m still thinking about it  
Rendon wouldn t offer details on his undisclosed injury  but said it has bothered him for a while 
 Definitely a few weeks now   he said   And I m pretty sure you can go back and watch the games  I haven t been running out balls as much as I usually do in the past  So you guys can go back and try to figure that out  I m not going to release that  
On Tuesday night  though  he was still scheduled to start his 50th consecutive game since returning from a brief stint on the injured list with a bruised left elbow May 7 
Rendon suffered the contusion when he was hit by a pitch in a game against the Miami Marlins on April 20  He attempted to return to the lineup on April 26  but was 0 for 3 against the San Diego Padres and landed on the IL  He missed 14 games due to the injury 
Entering Tuesday s action  Rendon was hitting  311 with 19 home runs and 58 RBIs this season in 69 games  His 1 028 OPS leads all third baseman in the majors and ranks fifth among all position players 
Rendon and the Chicago Cubs  Kris Bryant were the two National League reserves selected to back up Colorado third baseman Nolan Arenado  who was picked to start in the voting by fans 
With Major League Baseball putting pressure in recent years on players to ensure those selected will participate in the All Star festivities even if they feel they can t play  Rendon is more than likely to show up at Progressive  NYSE PGR  Field in Cleveland next week 
 I have a funny feeling    this is just me speaking  I don t speak for Anthony    but I think he ll show up in Cleveland   Nationals manager Davey Martinez said   It s fun  They re not playing three days in a row  He s not doing the Home Run Derby  I think he needs to experience it  and see what it s like  and go in there and play three or four innings  whatever he s going to do  and go from there  But I think he really needs to 
 I mean  he deserves it  If anybody deserves it  it s him  For me  even from the other side  he s been an All Star for many years  He finally got selected  so I think he needs to go and enjoy it

94735,316250,PGR,Explainer  Von der Leyen s rocky path to confirmation as EU Commission chief,news,"By Francesco Guarascio and Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS  Reuters    European Union lawmakers are likely to confirm Germany s Ursula von der Leyen as president of the bloc s executive Commission in a secret ballot next Tuesday  but there is a risk she could fall short of the absolute majority she needs 
Many members of the European Parliament are angry that EU leaders  horse trading over top posts at a bruising summit last week  brushed aside the so called  Spitzenkandidaten   the main parliamentary groups  candidates for the job 
If the 60 year old conservative German defense minister scrapes through with a slim majority she could face a shaky start to her five year term  especially if she has to rely on the far right and nationalists from eastern Europe to get her across the line 
Worse  if it emerges that British members of the European Parliament swung the vote for von der Leyen  there may be questions about her legitimacy after the United Kingdom leaves the EU on Oct  31  the current deadline for Brexit 
Von der Leyen would be the first woman to lead the powerful European Commission  which oversees trade negotiations  antitrust rulings and broad policy for 500 million Europeans 
If lawmakers reject von der Leyen  who was nominated by EU leaders on July 2 in what some branded a backroom deal  it would be another reputational blow for the bloc  rocked in the last decade by the euro zone debt crisis  Britain s decision to leave and the rise of far right and far left eurosceptic parties 
NUMBERS GAME
Von der Leyen will address the 751 member European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday  and then lawmakers will hold a debate and proceed to vote for or against her in a secret ballot at 6 p m   1600 GMT  
She needs the backing of an absolute majority  which would normally be 376  The assembly is currently four members short  however  which means she may need 374 votes from a total of 747 
Cobbling together that number has been complicated by May s elections to the parliament  which delivered a more fragmented assembly with a bigger far right contingent 
The vote could be postponed if lawmakers needed more time to make up their mind about von der Leyen  a diplomat said 
A second diplomat said it was very hard to see someone taking the responsibility for striking her down  but that the secret ballot made things more complicated 
 Things for now are not looking great  there will be many last minute calls to be made   the diplomat added 
Von der Leyen  who hails from the center right wing of European politics led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel  can count on the votes of lawmakers from the conservative European People s Party  EPP   which has 182 seats 
The Greens  who have 74 seats  and the European United Left Nordic Green Left  GUE NGL   with 41  decided this week not to back von der Leyen  making support from the center left crucial 
It is unclear how much backing she has from the Progressive  NYSE PGR  Alliance of Socialists and Democrats  S D   who have 153 seats  and the Renew Europe liberals  who have 108  Diplomats said lawmakers from these groups have come under pressure from their countries  governments to vote for von der Leyen 
Germany s Social Democrats  SPD   junior partners in the ruling coalition in which von der Leyen has served  oppose her nomination  describing her to their S D allies as  inadequate and inappropriate  for the role 
Merkel said on Thursday their stance was  not an easy situation  for her coalition  She was the only EU leader to abstain in a vote last week on the top jobs package after she consulted the SPD  which rejected the deal 
The right wing European Conservatives and Reformists  ECR   will decide just ahead of the vote whether to support von der Leyen  but officials say the group is divided over the issue 
 The most awkward thing would be a slight majority based on support from the extremes   said Maria Demertzis  deputy director of Brussels based think tank Bruegel 
 But at the same time  a slim majority in the parliament is less of a problem when she already has the support of the     EU member states that have chosen her  
If von der Leyen is rejected by the European Parliament  the ball would be back in the court of the Council of EU leaders  who would have one month to come up with another candidate ",2019-07-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/explainer-von-der-leyens-rocky-path-to-confirmation-as-eu-commission-chief-1922116,1922116
94748,316263,PGR,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Progressive  PGR ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Progressive  PGR   This company  which is in the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 11 43  
For the last reported quarter  Progressive came out with earnings of  1 42 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 33 per share  representing a surprise of 6 77   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 43 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 66 per share  delivering a surprise of 16 08  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Progressive lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Progressive has an Earnings ESP of  5 12  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-progressive-pgr-200498410,200498410

The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 18 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  168 2  
Revenues are expected to be  9 57 billion  up 11 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 24  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Progressive 
For Progressive  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  5 27  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Progressive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Progressive would post earnings of  1 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 42  delivering a surprise of  6 77  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Progressive appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/progressive-pgr-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4-release-200499048,200499048

94765,316280,PGR,Singapore to Focus on Regional Deals as Trade War Thwarts Growth,news," Bloomberg     Singapore will focus on regional trade and digital economic agreements to counter the impact of the U S  China trade war that s weighing on the nation s growth prospects and prompting some economists to warn of a recession risk 
It s important that Singapore works on different types of regional arrangements to  find new pathways for growth   S  Iswaran  minister for communications and information  said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday  He referred to pacts such as the Comprehensive and Progressive  NYSE PGR  Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership  or CPTPP  and the EU Singapore free trade agreement 
One of the biggest challenges facing Singapore now is navigating external geopolitical uncertainties  Iswaran said  As trade disagreements between the U S  and China morphed over the past year into a full blown trade war  global growth engines have stalled  the city s central bank chief said on Thursday 
U S  President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet on Saturday at the sidelines of the G 20 summit in Osaka as the leaders try to resolve their trade war 
Trade tensions could turn out to be  an opportunity for Southeast Asia to be the place where China and U S  can invest and can jointly and participate in growth of this region   Iswaran said 
Singapore is reviewing its 2019 growth projection range of 1 5  to 2 5  amid concern the trade war is spreading  while Maybank Kim Eng Research is warning that Singapore s economy will probably experience a  shallow technical recession  in the third quarter 
Alarm bells on the island s growth are ringing at a time when the government is planning to roll out key 5G technology  which is seen as essential for deployment of key automation technologies such as the internet of things applications  Another challenge for Singapore is managing the technological transition within its economy  Iswaran said

94778,316293,PGR,Is Progressive Corporation  PGR  A Suitable Value Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Progressive Corporation   NYSE PGR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Progressive Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 65  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 54  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Progressive Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 09  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that Progressive Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 13 75  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates indicate that the company s share price will likely appreciate in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Progressive Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 18  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 38 right now  As we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years PGR is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Progressive Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Progressive Corporation a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Progressive Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of F  This gives PGR a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and two lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and five downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased 1 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Progressive Corporation Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineProgressive Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 42   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name

94788,316303,PGR,White House  Democrats in Talks to End Holdup on USMCA Approval,news," Bloomberg     The White House and congressional Democrats have opened talks to resolve outstanding details that have thus far held up the new North American trade deal  according to people briefed on discussions between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and trade chief Robert Lighthizer 
Pelosi told Lighthizer that she will designate members of her caucus to be working group representatives to deal with labor  enforcement  environment and pharmaceutical provisions of the deal  two people briefed on the discussions said  The groups will likely consist of Democrats from the Ways and Means Committee  the congressional Progressive  NYSE PGR  Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus to ensure they can build consensus within the party  one of the people said 
The Trump administration had hoped to build momentum last week by lifting steel and aluminum tariffs  clearing a major hurdle for lawmakers to approve the U S  Mexico Canada Agreement  White House officials thought removing these duties would be enough to kick start work on the deal in Congress this week  but after several recent meetings with Pelosi  Lighthizer and his team decided they would need more time to get Democrats on board  the people said 
While Pelosi previously said she wants to work with the administration to make the deal better for Democrats  this is the first time she has directed members of her party to sit down across the table from the U S  Trade Representative and his team  Business groups and analysts eager for a deal interpreted the move as a positive sign that the speaker will seriously engage in fixing the issues that her members have flagged as insufficient 
Lifting Tariffs
Steny Hoyer  the second ranking Democrat in the House who tends to speak for the more moderate members of his party  said they are still working on labor  enforcement and pharmaceutical provisions 
 The administration wants to get to yes  we would like to get to yes   Hoyer told reporters Tuesday 
Trump last week announced that he reached a deal with Mexico and Canada to lift steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed on the countries last year  Congressional Republicans publicly opposed the duties and called on Trump to remove them if he wants a legislative victory on his North American trade deal  Major trade associations were split on fully endorsing the USMCA until the tariffs were lifted 
Removing the duties means Republicans and the business community now are united in their push for fast approval of the agreement  But Pelosi and her caucus have made clear they don t want the administration to rush a vote before the substance of the deal is satisfactory 
A labor enforcement proposal written by Sens  Sherrod Brown and Ron Wyden that could address some Democratic concerns has been shared with House staff  It got a serious look in both the House and the Senate  though many technical details still need to be figured out  two of the people said 
 Put Politics Aside 
Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa  who chairs the Finance Committee with jurisdiction over trade  said Monday after a meeting with Lighthizer that he s offering his help to get Democrats to a place where they can support the deal 
 I want to sit down and talk to them   he said of his Democratic colleagues   Any way I can help I will  
He added that Democrats should be satisfied that Mexico passed its labor reform legislation earlier this month  And he said that Canada s plan to pass the new Nafta by June 25 will give momentum to the U S  process   The support of a socialist prime minister in Canada ought to help convince some Senate Democrats   he said 
House Republicans also criticized what they described as foot dragging from their Democratic colleagues  Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said lifting steel and aluminum tariffs  along with Mexico s labor reform  should be enough for Democrats to accept the deal 
 It s time to put politics aside and actually put America first   McCarthy said Tuesday 
As the next procedural step  the White House has to submit a draft statement of administrative action that lays out the changes to U S  law and starts a 30 day clock before legislation can be sent to the Congress that lawmakers will put to a vote  Grassley said the trade committee staff for both Democrats and Republicans have been briefed on the draft statement  which he considered a sign that the administration could send it sooner rather than later 
Deputy USTR C J  Mahoney and the White House office of legislative affairs for the past six weeks have been holding weekly inter agency meetings on USMCA  one person said  In the past two weeks  the White House geared up to submit the draft to Congress  but decided in the past week to take a slower approach 
Lighthizer had lunch with Senate Republicans Tuesday and afterward South Dakota senator John Thune  a member of Republican leadership  said the trade chief was upbeat about the prospects for getting the deal approved in the House  Thune said the discussion was  mainly about his talks with Speaker Pelosi and that he thinks there is a seriousness in the House about trying to get this done  
Ohio senator Rob Portman said Lighthizer believed Democrats  are trying to get to yes  and that their negotiations with the White House are  productive and in good faith   He said Lighthizer told the GOP caucus that no decision has been made on the timing for submitting the agreement for a vote  because  it depends on House leadership  ",2019-05-21,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/white-house-democrats-in-talks-to-end-holdup-on-usmca-approval-1874950,1874950

94790,316305,PGR,Modi promises inclusive India after stunning election win,news,By Alasdair Pal and Mayank Bhardwaj NEW DELHI AYODHYA  Reuters    Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to unite the country on Thursday after a big election win  with his party on course to increase its majority on a mandate of business friendly policies and a tough stand on national security  Official data from the Election Commission showed Modi s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  ahead in 300 of the 542 seats being contested  up from the 282 it won in 2014 and more than the 272 seats needed for a majority in the lower house of parliament  That would give it the first back to back majority for a single party since 1984    Together we will build a strong and inclusive India   Modi said on Twitter    India wins yet again   Modi s victory boosted financial markets as investors expect his government to continue to pursue economic reforms  He will be under pressure to provide work opportunities for the tens of millions of young people coming on to the job market in the next few years and to boost depressed farm incomes    The immediate challenges are to address employment  the issue of agricultural income and revive the banking sector   said Madan Sabnavis  chief economist at Care Ratings in Mumbai   But making good on his promise of unity will be difficult as the BJP campaign was often divisive  and members of the minority Muslim community expressed fears that they were being treated as second class citizens  His pledge to take a strong stand against a separatist movement in the Muslim majority Kashmir region has added to tensions with nuclear armed rival Pakistan   Members of his party now want him to take a harder line on national security  as well as build a Hindu temple on the site of a mosque that was demolished by a Hindu mob in Ayodhya in 1992   I want Modi to finish terrorism from Kashmir  and  make Pakistan bite the dust again and again   said Shekhar Chahal  a BJP worker from New Delhi    I am confident that Modi will also make the temple in Ayodhya   CELEBRATIONS BEGIN Cheering supporters set off firecrackers and showered the mastermind of the campaign  BJP President Amit Shah  with petals as he arrived at party headquarters in New Delhi   It s a stamp of approval by voters on the honest and decisive leadership of Prime Minister Modi   said Nalin S Kohli  a BJP spokesman   Congress leaders were sombre    Why despite a weak economy people preferred the BJP is something we have to understand   said Salman Soz  a party spokesman    People have given them a second chance  I hope they use it well   The NDA s predicted margin of victory  at 348 seats to 85 for the Congress led United Progressive  NYSE PGR  Alliance  according to TV channel NDTV  is much larger than surveys indicated in the run up to the vote  Most polls indicated a victory for Modi s alliance but short of an overall majority   Final results are due by Thursday evening   Click HERE  to view a graphic showing live updates of India s elections results  SECURITY SWING Modi was under pressure when he began campaigning  losing three state elections in December amid rising anger over farm prices and unemployment  However  campaigning shifted toward India s relationship with Pakistan after a suicide bomber killed 40 Indian police in the contested Kashmir region in February  Modi ordered an air strike on what India said was a militant training camp on the Pakistani side of the border  a tough response that benefited the right wing BJP  analysts said  Pakistan has this week signaled a willingness to open talks with India  but in a possible warning  it announced that it has conducted a training launch of a surface to surface ballistic missile  which it said was capable of delivering conventional and nuclear weapons at a range of up to 1 500 miles   The BJP has also capitalized on the star power of Modi  a frenetic campaigner  as well as its superior financial resources  It outspent Congress by six times on Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  advertising  data showed  and by as much as 20 times overall  sources told Reuters this month   The poor showing by Congress  that was ahead in just 52 seats  will lead to questions over the leadership of Rahul Gandhi  a scion of the Nehru Gandhi dynasty whose father  grandmother and great grandfather all served as prime minister  Gandhi trailed the BJP candidate in the Amethi constituency that his family has held almost continuously for the last four decades    The Congress party has not been able to improve at all   said Rahul Verma  a fellow at the center for Policy Research in New Delhi   One big story is the emerging challenge for the Congress to remain a national alternative to the BJP  That now is under question   STRONG LEADER In populous Uttar Pradesh state  which sends the largest number of lawmakers to parliament  the BJP defeated a powerful alliance of caste based parties campaigning on improving the lot of rural folk  leading in 60 of 80 seats on offer    After the air strike on Pakistan  almost all these important issues started fading and farmers  including many members of my family decided to cast their ballot for the BJP   said Raghubar Das  55  who grows rice and wheat on the outskirts of Ayodhya town   Mind you  they didn t vote for the BJP  they voted for Modi  Everyone loves a strong a leader   The party also won seats in several states where it has long struggled  including West Bengal  where it targeted the Trinamool Congress  a powerful regional party in campaigning that often turned violent   The BJP was leading in 19 of 42 seats in the state  significantly better than the two it won in 2014  data showed  Investors gave a big thumbs up to Modi s victory  hoping his government will push through reforms  Indian stocks surged more than 5 percent this week and hit record highs on Thursday  as it became clear that Modi would clinch a second term  The euphoria quickly evaporated though  with stocks and the rupee ending weaker on the day  as the focus shifts back to an economy that is faltering  even as the U S  China

94814,316329,PGR,Former VP Biden s 2020 bid reshapes White House race,news,"By James Oliphant and John Whitesides WASHINGTON  Reuters    Former U S  Vice President Joe Biden entered the 2020 Democratic presidential field on Thursday as an instant front runner  drawing momentum away from other leading candidates and putting new pressure on underperformers to find ways to stay relevant   Biden  76  a longtime U S  senator who served two terms as then President Barack Obama s No  2  announced his bid in a video describing the high stakes of the race to take on Republican President Donald Trump in next year s election   We are in the battle for the soul of this nation   Biden said   I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time  But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House  he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation  who we are  and I cannot stand by and let that happen   Trump responded in a post on Twitter  saying  welcome to the race Sleepy Joe  and slamming Biden s intelligence   Biden joins U S  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  a self described  democratic socialist   atop the 20 candidate field  With Biden positioned to be Sanders  chief rival  the resulting clash could lay bare the conflict in the Democratic Party between its moderate and progressive wings   Although Biden has yet to lay out policy proposals as a candidate  he backs many causes valued by progressives  including raising the minimum wage  combating climate change  banning assault weapons and free public college  He has not come out in favor of a Medicare for All plan advocated by Sanders and others  Kyle Kondik  a political analyst at the University of Virginia  says it remains unclear whether Biden can build on his loyal base of support  If that happens  it could come at Sanders  expense  Given his long standing support from African Americans and his partnership with Obama  Biden could also affect the candidacy of U S  Senator Kamala Harris of California  who is widely regarded as a serious contender for the nomination  Biden s entry also threatens to derail the rise of Pete Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Indiana  who has benefited from a surge of media coverage in recent weeks  And it further presses candidates such as former housing Secretary Julian Castro of Texas  U S  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper  who have failed so far to register with voters  to come up with ways to stay in the game    In many ways  this settles the race down rather than shaking it up   said Jeff Link  a Democratic strategist in Iowa who worked for Obama s presidential campaign in 2008   But Biden faces his own challenges  including questions about whether he is too old and too centrist for a party yearning for fresh faces and increasingly propelled by its more vocal liberal wing  Biden failed to gain traction with voters during previous presidential bid in 1988 and 2008  As speculation about his third effort mounted  Biden came under fire for his propensity for touching and kissing strangers at political events  with several women coming forward to say he had made them feel uncomfortable   Biden struggled in his response to the concerns  at times joking about his behavior  But ultimately he apologized and said he recognized standards for personal conduct had evolved in the wake of the  MeToo movement   Joe Biden is going to regret this decision   said Matt Gorman  a former official at the National Republican Congressional Committee  an arm of the Republican Party   His candidacy will not only rehash his very long record in public life  but allow his opponents to subtly argue he is too old and too moderate to be the Democratic standard bearer   Obama said in a statement that he has long said selecting Biden to be his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made   Biden on Thursday told reporters in Wilmington  Delaware  that he has asked Obama to not endorse him   Whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits   Biden said   THREAT TO NATION  On Thursday  Biden held up the example of the 2017 attack at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville  Virginia  that killed a counterprotester as a defining moment for the nation    It was there     we saw  Ku Klux  Klansmen and white supremacists and neo Nazis come out in the open     baring the fangs of racism   Biden said  criticizing Trump s remarks at the time that there were  very fine people on both sides   There was no moral equivalence between racists and those fighting such inequality  he said    In that moment  I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had ever seen in my lifetime   Biden said  Biden will travel across the country in the coming weeks  kicking off his tour with a visit on Monday to Pittsburgh   Pennsylvania  not far from Biden s home state of Delaware  is a key battleground state and former industrial hub that backed Trump in 2016  The Republican president is seeking to capture the state again even as Democrats saw wins there in the 2018 congressional elections  CENTRIST CANDIDATE Biden s long history in the Senate  where he was a leading voice on foreign policy  will give liberal activists plenty to criticize  He is the only candidate in the field who voted in support of the Iraq War in 2002   As Senate Judiciary Committee chairman  he angered women s rights activists with his handling of sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas by law professor Anita Hill during the justice s 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings  The New York Times reported on Thursday that Biden phoned Hill earlier this month to express regret about what she  endured  testifying against Thomas  Hill told the Times that the call left her unsatisfied and that she could not support his presidential bid   He also has been censured over his ties to the financial industry and for his authorship of a 1994 crime act that led to increased incarceration rates   The Progressive   NYSE PGR  Change Campaign Committee  which backs U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  said Biden s centrist record could be a hindrance  
 If Joe Biden positions himself as the political insider from yesteryear who says big ideas like universal childcare  student debt relief and a wealth tax on ultra millionaires are not possible  he would be an easy foil   said Adam Green  the group s co founder ",2019-04-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/former-vice-president-joe-biden-to-make-third-run-for-the-white-house-1845502,1845502

94816,316331,PGR,Factbox  The main political parties in South Africa s election,news,"JOHANNESBURG  Reuters    South Africans voting for a new national parliament on May 8 will have 48 parties to choose from    more than at any election since the end of white minority rule in 1994  Many more political parties are contesting elections for nine provincial legislatures to be held on the same day  The African National Congress  ANC  has won every parliamentary election since 1994  and opinion polls predict it will again win a majority of the 400 seats in the National Assembly  the lower house of parliament  next month  But President Cyril Ramaphosa is under pressure to reverse a slide in support for the ANC  which has seen its share of the parliamentary vote drop from a high of more than 69 percent in 2004 to 62 percent in 2014  The ANC s biggest rivals this time are main opposition party the Democratic Alliance  DA  and the Economic Freedom Fighters  EFF   a radical leftist group  Parliamentary and provincial elections happen every five years  with seats allocated according to a proportional representation system   Some polls suggest there could be coalition governments in provinces such as Gauteng  an economic hub where support for the ANC is expected to fall  or the Western Cape  which is controlled by the DA but where the party is seen losing ground  Below are more details on the three main parties  AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS The ANC swept to power in 1994 under liberation hero Nelson Mandela  who became South Africa s first black president after leading the fight against the brutal apartheid regime  It has been the majority party in the National Assembly for the past 25 years and currently governs every province apart from the Western Cape  Many black South Africans grew up associating the ANC with their dream of a country free from racial segregation and with equal access to jobs and education  Although the ANC has achieved important successes by providing formal housing and basic services like electricity to many black families for the first time  the scale of the problems it inherited means change has been slow and many people today are impatient for more  Under its previous leader  former president Jacob Zuma  whom the ANC ousted in February last year  a string of scandals involving corruption and gross maladministration seriously tarnished the party s image  Zuma denies any wrongdoing  His successor  former trade union leader turned businessman Ramaphosa  is trying to make amends by cracking down on corruption and revitalizing the stagnant economy  But he faces a struggle convincing some members of his party to back his reformist agenda  DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE The DA won 22 percent of the parliamentary vote in 2014  giving it the second biggest number of seats in the National Assembly  It traces its roots back to the Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  a group formed by white liberals who opposed apartheid  and has grown partly by merging with other parties  In 2015 the DA appointed its first black leader  Mmusi Maimane  to broaden its appeal and improved its national standing by leading coalition victories in local government elections in metropolitan areas like Johannesburg a year later  But some analysts say it has lost its way since reaching what is considered its highest political milestone  and some polls show that its support could wane   Last year the DA became embroiled in a bitter dispute with one of its most prominent politicians  former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille  De Lille has a strong following in the Western Cape and left the DA to form her own party  which could dent the DA s support  Some political commentators say Ramaphosa appeals to part of the DA s support base  the middle class and business owners who favor market friendly policies  ECONOMIC FREEDOM FIGHTERS  The EFF won 6 percent of the vote in 2014  making it the third largest party in parliament  Some polls show the party almost doubling its vote share this time around  Known for its far left policies including plans to nationalize mines  the party punches above its weight on the political scene  It played a key role in holding Zuma to account for spending state money on non security upgrades to his private residence and has shaped the debate on land expropriation without compensation  a policy the ANC has said it intends to carry out in due course  The EFF is led by Julius Malema  a fiery orator who formed the party in 2013 after he was expelled from the ANC  where he headed the party s youth wing  His political rhetoric appeals to mainly younger black voters who are disillusioned with 25 years of ANC rule   
The EFF  whose lawmakers often dress in red overalls and plastic hard hats to show their allegiance to the working class  emerged as a kingmaker in 2016 elections in metropolitan areas like the administrative capital Pretoria and commercial capital Johannesburg  where it backed DA candidates ",2019-04-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/factbox-the-main-political-parties-in-south-africas-election-1850212,1850212

For almost three years  Theresa May has clung to power with grim determination  fighting to complete her defining mission and deliver Brexit Britain s ruling Conservative Party finally ran out of patience yesterday  In a tense and emotional meeting inside May s wood paneled Westminster offices  the party s grandees delivered their blunt message to the prime minister  it s time to go  The question is who   and what   comes now 
May was forced to promise a timetable for stepping down  and to formally start a contest to pick her successor as party leader  and thus prime minister   after she tries one last time in June to get lawmakers to endorse her to get her Brexit plan  Today  her attempt to strike a cross party deal on Brexit finally  broke down today  compounding her predicament 
Boris Johnson  the  colorful former foreign minister who quit in protest at May s handling of talks to leave the European Union  announced that he will stand  Others are waiting in the wings Johnson s strongly pro Brexit stance makes him the current favorite in what will be an unpredictable and over crowded race  But would he find delivering Brexit any easier  Unless he triggers and wins a general election  or a second referendum on the EU divorce  he will have no mandate or means to get any deal through Britain s deadlocked Parliament In the end  that s what destroyed Theresa May  Whoever replaces her  Britain faces yet more political turbulence ahead

94846,316361,PGR,U S  House Democrats call off budget vote after liberal revolt,news,"By Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  House of Representatives Democrats on Tuesday canceled a planned floor vote on legislation to set federal spending levels for next year after the party s left wing demanded more money for domestic programs 
It was an awkward moment for Democrats  who won control of the House from Republicans in last November s congressional elections  but now appear unable to unify liberals and moderates around a budget plan  The House vote had been planned for Wednesday and would have been the first step in negotiations with the Republican led Senate over spending levels 
Republicans  when they led the House  had similar difficulties  Over the years  Congress has frequently failed to pass a budget blueprint 
It was only the opening salvo in what could be a long running battle over spending levels and priorities  especially given Republican President Donald Trump s calls for deep spending cuts to non defense programs and differences over border security policy 
Such disagreements can sometimes lead to standoffs like the one that resulted in a 35 day partial government shutdown that ended earlier this year 
House liberals were unhappy because the pending Democratic legislation  based on a plan approved by the Budget Committee  had set spending caps for fiscal year 2020 with  664 billion in defense spending  higher than domestic discretionary spending at  631 billion 
The liberals sought  33 billion more for domestic spending  But if that were added in  there was a danger not enough moderate Democrats would back the legislation  aides and lawmakers said 
 We fundamentally disagree with leadership      It s the first time Democrats are back in control  that was our opportunity to put parity between defense and non defense   said Representative Mark Pocan  a Democrat and chairman of the Congressional Progressive  NYSE PGR  Caucus 
 Education  infrastructure and healthcare are really the issues that we ran on last November  and we re just trying to get the  Democratic  caucus to do that   Pocan said 
Democratic leaders said talks with the Senate could still go ahead and they inserted provisions in another measure that passed on Tuesday allowing House appropriators to start work on individual spending bills 
Democrats said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would be meeting Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to try to reach a spending agreement 
 If we can do that  that s the best way to do it  because then the Senate will agree to it   said House Majority leader Steny Hoyer  adding that hopefully  McConnell could then get the White House to agree ",2019-04-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/us-house-democrats-call-off-budget-vote-after-liberal-revolt-1831919,1831919

94861,316376,PGR,Progressive  PGR  Beats Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Progressive  PGR  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 42 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 33 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 57 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 77   A quarter ago  it was expected that this insurer would post earnings of  1 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 66  delivering a surprise of 16 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Progressive  which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry  posted revenues of  9 47 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 92   This compares to year ago revenues of  8 31 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Progressive shares have added about 24 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 5  
What s Next for Progressive 
While Progressive has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions

94893,316408,PGR,Will Progressive  PGR  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Progressive  PGR   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This insurer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 24 35  
For the last reported quarter  Progressive came out with earnings of  1 66 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 43 per share  representing a surprise of 16 08   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 38 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 83 per share  delivering a surprise of 32 61  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Progressive  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Progressive currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 89   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-progressive-pgr-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200469974,200469974

Product innovations can be expected to enhance this shipbuilder s footprint in the business jet market  However  rising interest expenses can be a potential headwind for the company s bottom line growth going ahead

Shares of Merck have gained 2  in the past six months  outperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s fall of 5 3  over the same period  The Zacks analyst believes that Merck s new products like Keytruda  Lynparza and Bridion are contributing meaningfully to the top line 
Keytruda sales are gaining momentum with approval for additional indications  especially in the first line lung cancer setting  Keytruda has strong growth prospects based on increased utilization  recent approvals for new indications and potential additional approvals worldwide  Animal health and vaccine products are also performing strongly and remain core growth drivers for Merck 
However  generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to be overhangs on the top line  Rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and products like Isentress  HIV   Zepatier  HCV  and Zostavax  vaccine  remains a concern

Leadership in product  service and distribution innovation  especially in personal auto bodes well for long term growth  Policies in force and retention ratio will continue to remain healthy  The company s Snapshot  Robinson and Home Quote Explorer programs should continue to drive its business

The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 31 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 6  
Revenues are expected to be  9 38 billion  up 12 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 38  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Progressive 
For Progressive  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 89  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Progressive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Progressive would post earnings of  1 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 66  delivering a surprise of  16 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Progressive appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/progressive-pgr-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200471516,200471516

94899,316414,PGR,5 Insurance Stocks Poised To Beat Q3 Earnings Estimates ,opinion,The  sector is set to report financial numbers from next week  Per the latest   Finance is one of the seven Zacks sectors likely to deliver earnings growth  Earnings for the sector are expected to increase 0 2  on 6 5  higher revenues Integral to the Finance sector  insurers are expected to deliver better numbers in the to be reported quarter  Insurers are likely to have benefited from improved pricing  reinsurance agreements  compelling products and service portfolio  adoption of technologies to curb operational costs and deeper reach  Catastrophe losses and lower interest rate might have acted as partial offsets  Nonetheless  better employment scenario along with rising wages is expected to boost policy sales driving premiums higher The insurance industry lost 1 2  in the third quarter against the S P 500 Index s rise of 1 1  and the Finance sector s decrease of 0 6   The third quarter witnessed cat events as well as two rate cuts by the Federal Reserve   two major factors that may have affected insurers  performance  The third quarter of a year generally bears the brunt of unprecedented catastrophes  which cause mass devastation  Risk modeling and analytics firm RMS expects insured losses to range between  3 5 billion and  6 5 billion from Hurricane Dorian while catastrophe modeler Karen Clark   Co  estimates insured losses in the United States and Caribbean to be around  5 billion  per media release  RMS estimates insured losses from Typhoon Faxai to be between  5 billion and  9 billion while catastrophe risk modeling firm AIR Worldwide expects loss in the range of  3 billion to  7 billion Recently  Arch Capital Group   NASDAQ ACGL   estimated third quarter pre tax gross catastrophe loss in the range of  65  75 million  primarily due to Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai while AXIS Capital Holdings   NYSE AXS   estimated preliminary pre tax loss in the range of  150 million to  175 million in the third quarter  due to Hurricane Dorian  Japanese typhoons and other weather related events Nonetheless  underwriting profitability might have improved on better pricing and underwriting practice  In a report published in Business Insurance  four of the six commercial property casualty insurance lines posted higher premium renewal rates during the third quarter of 2019 per insurance exchange Ivans Insurance Solutions  Workers compensation however witnessed soft pricing  According to Ivans Insurance Solutions  commercial property rates increased 4 2   businessowners policies rate rose 4 17  and commercial auto rates increased 4 32   Umbrella liability and general liability rates witnessed 2 66  and 2 51  rise respectively Further  portfolio repositioning and reinsurance covers should have helped insurers withstand any deficits However  the Federal Reserve has made 25 basis points rate cut twice in the third quarter of 2019  citing muted inflation pressure and geopolitical tension  The rate now stands in the range of 1 75 2   Nonetheless  higher invested asset base might have somewhat offset the impact of low rates for insures Increased use of technology like blockchain  artificial intelligence  advanced analytics  telematics  cloud computing and robotic process automation are likely to have expedited business operations and saved cost Also  a sturdy capital level is expected to have widened the scope for capital deployment to pursue growth initiatives as well as reward shareholders via dividend hikes  special dividends and share buybacks Potential Q3 OutperformersWith the help of our   we have identified a few stocks poised to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter   These

strategies  These innovative solutions by IBM s Watson position the company well to gain momentum While these developments are expected to positively impact the upcoming quarterly results  IBM s

week he was  very close  to deciding whether to make a 2020 White House bid and will run only if he thinks he can win the Democratic Party s nomination  He is not alone in questioning if he is the man for the moment  The clamor for Biden to join the pack seeking to challenge Republican President Donald Trump has quieted as the Democratic field has grown more crowded and diverse  according to interviews with more than two dozen strategists  activists  party organizers and voters  Opinion polls show Biden  a former U S  senator from Delaware who served two terms as former President Barack Obama s vice president  remains popular  But the Democratic Party may no longer need him in order to be competitive against Trump   I love Joe Biden  He s a great guy and a great politician   said Jerry Shriner  a Democratic National Committee member from Idaho   I wish he were the president right now  But I m not sure I wish he is president in 2021   Democrats are in the early stages of an internal debate about how best to challenge Trump in next year s presidential election  weighing factors like electability  ideology and identity  The strength of the field   expected to include at least six sitting U S  senators  plus several current or former governors  U S  House of Representatives members and a former Cabinet secretary   is a factor in Biden s calculations  those close to him say  He will be more likely to remain on the sidelines if he feels a strong candidate capable of beating Trump is emerging  But a source close to Biden said   If I had to guess  he s probably going to do it   Biden associates have held discussions with potential staffers and supporters who could serve political strategy  grassroots organizing and digital campaign roles  according to two sources  One source said those conversations were necessary to quickly ramp up a formal campaign operation should Biden decide to run  Some party activists say  however  that Biden has not reached out to broad donor networks to gauge the level of monetary support he could expect   Biden  who mounted failed presidential campaigns in 1998 and 2008  said at an event in Delaware on Tuesday that he did not want a third bid to be  a fool s errand    What I don t want to do is take people s time  effort and commitment without there being a clear shot I could be the nominee   he said   I think I can    TOO OLD  Biden chose not to run in 2016 when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was widely considered the heavy favorite for the Democratic nomination  Some political analysts have since speculated he could have won industrial battleground states like Pennsylvania  Michigan and Wisconsin that proved crucial to Trump s surprise victory  Biden s high name recognition among Democratic voters means he likely can afford to wait longer than lesser known candidates to enter the 2020 race  But even that comes with a risk    The longer he waits  the more people are going to start to want to follow some of the new and younger voices they re hearing   said Bret Niles  the Democratic Party chairman in Linn County  Iowa   Biden s age  ideology and record already are drawing scrutiny  If elected  he would be 78 when he was sworn in    Joe Biden is too old   said Mary Donough  60  a Democrat from Des Moines  Iowa  who plans to participate in her state s crucial nominating caucus next year and wants a younger candidate to challenge Trump   There is just more energy there   she said  Biden s backers will argue his age represents experience  said a former aide who asked to speak on background in order to explain internal talking points    Voters look at Donald Trump and they look at what we re missing  which is someone who understands the institution  someone who is an adult  someone who is seasoned  someone who respects the institutions   the former aide said  If Biden does run  the chair of the Republican National Committee  Ronna McDaniel  said on Thursday that Trump and the Republican Party would attack his work as vice president under Obama   Go ahead and run   McDaniel told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill  Maryland   Run on your record of stagnant wages  of jobs leaving this country  of manufacturing jobs fleeing United States of America  of bad trade deals  of bad foreign policy  The Democratic Party undoubtedly has moved left since the last time Biden appeared alone on a ballot in 2008  when he was re elected to the Senate by Delaware voters for his seventh term   Times have changed   said Adam Green  co founder of the Progressive  NYSE PGR  Change Campaign Committee   Does he meet the moment    Green  whose group supports the candidacy of U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  lumps Biden in with white  male  moderate Democrats who have faltered in recent elections  like Phil Bredesen  who lost his U S  Senate race in Tennessee last year  Biden also will have to answer for his record  He chaired the 1991 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and was criticized for not doing enough to protect Anita Hill  who accused Thomas of sexual harassment  Biden has since apologized and said he should have done more to shield Hill from attacks by Republicans  Unions remain unhappy about the free trade deals advocated by the Obama administration  and liberal progressive groups point to the bailout of Wall Street banks during the financial crisis that provided no help to distressed homeowners   Sharon Holle  who has been working to organize for Biden in Iowa ahead of his decision  argued his experience would appeal to Democrats nervous about the country s direction under Trump

94910,316425,PGR,Alice in Wonderland Economy Spawns MMT Debate  Fed Rate Rethink,news," Bloomberg     Curiouser and curiouser 
The U S  government is borrowing bucketloads of money  with budget deficits on track to hit  1 trillion a year and rising  Yet the deluge of debt isn t pushing interest rates up from their paltry levels    or stoking inflation  which remains stubbornly below the Federal Reserve s 2 percent target 
 This is an Alice in Wonderland world    said former International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard 
It s one that Japan has long been familiar with  and Europe may be getting used to  In the U S   it s prompting policy makers to reconsider how public finances and interest rates should be managed  Possible results include even bigger government deficits and debt  and faster inflation    all anathema to Econ 101 
Voodoo Economics 
In Congress  there s a brewing fight over fiscal policy  Progressive  NYSE PGR  Democrats have seized on the growing tolerance of red ink to propose expensive new programs like the Green New Deal championed by New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  The political calculus goes something like this  If President Donald Trump can drive up the deficit by cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy without spooking the bond market  why can t the Democrats do the same with the spending packages they prefer 
At the Fed  Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues are conducting a formal review of how they make policy    and putting a renewed focus on fanning the inflation they complain is  muted   After raising interest rates four times in 2018  the central bank surprised markets in January by calling a time out  Investors are now betting the Fed will stay on hold for the rest of this year  and that its next rate move is more likely to be a cut than a hike 
In academia  meanwhile  a debate on the efficacy of government debt is playing out among left leaning economists  At its heart is something called Modern Monetary Theory    a heterodox economic school that argues the U S  can run bigger budget shortfalls without worrying about going broke  because it prints its own money 
Mainstream Democrat economists have lambasted the theory  Former Treasury Secretary and now Harvard University professor Larry Summers has said it s akin to voodoo economics  with its promise of a proverbial free lunch 
 Assuming We re Alive    
But such blowback obscures an important point  Even among establishment figures like Summers  there s a growing tolerance for deficits  In a keynote address to the American Economic Association in January  Blanchard argued that with interest rates low and likely to stay that way  government debt needn t be a bogeyman 
The Peterson Institute for International Economics senior fellow returned to the theme last week  sketching out this hypothetical scenario to reporters   It s 2050  global temperature has increased by 5 percent  the world is coming to an end  And we turn to the kids at that point  assuming we re still alive  and we say   Look guys  yes  it s not good  but there is no debt   
The Fed has a shorter horizon for its wide ranging review of strategies  tools and communications practices    an idea borrowed from the Bank of Canada  It s seeking outside views  and aims to reach conclusions in the first half of next year 
Front and center is what to do about inflation  Powell has ruled out raising the 2 percent target  But he s also evinced concern about the risk of the U S  falling into a disinflationary spiral 
That s what happened to Japan more than two decades ago    with disastrous results  Because the Japanese expected prices to keep falling  consumers put off purchases and companies shelved expansion plans  and zero rates policy at the central bank failed to entice them  Eventually  a combination of cheap money and budget deficits succeeded in shoring up demand  but only after years of lost growth 
 Seductive Idea 
In a March 8 speech  Powell suggested one way to battle the  low inflation syndrome   from the monetary side  He said the Fed could adopt a  make up   strategy    letting inflation run above target during good times like now  to offset the periods of slower price rises 
The aim would be to cement the public s view of where prices are headed  and so avoid the deflationary trap that snared Japan   We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent    Powell told CBS in an interview aired March 10 
There are risks  of course  If consumers and companies decide that the goal of price stability has been abandoned  then inflation could rise a lot higher than the Fed wants    as in the 1970s when it reached double digits 
MMT type fiscal policy carries perils as well  It could open the floodgates to a rush of costly programs   It s a very seductive idea    said Maya MacGuineas  president of the non profit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget   I can spend money on everything   
And  taken together  a laissez faire approach to both inflation and deficits could awaken the bond vigilantes and send long term interest rates shooting skyward 
In the end though  the U S  may have little choice but to adapt policy to the looking glass economy it s stuck with  The same applies in much of the industrial world  Summers argued in a paper this month co authored with Bank of England Senior Economist Lukasz Rachel  Without a forceful response  he wrote  it s  at risk of mirroring the experience of Japan  ",2019-03-13,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/alice-in-wonderland-economy-spawns-mmt-debate-fed-rate-rethink-1805978,1805978

94931,316446,PGR,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Progressive  PGR ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Progressive  PGR  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this insurer is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Progressive is 23 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 22 3  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 18 5  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Progressive is 55 4   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11 9  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 19 3  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 4 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Progressive have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Progressive a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Progressive well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-09-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-progressive-pgr-200465347,200465347

94937,316452,PGR,As Democrats target Trump s tax returns  audit claims loom large,news,"By David Morgan WASHINGTON  Reuters    Congressional Democrats exploring ways to obtain President Donald Trump s tax returns may target the adequacy of the Internal Revenue Service audit that Trump often cites as his reason for not making the returns public  according to sources familiar with the matter  Such a strategy  focused more on the IRS than on Trump  could help Democrats craft an iron clad legal argument for what would likely follow from such a request   an unprecedented court battle over the tax records of a sitting president  Targeting the audit would put the request for the returns squarely within the oversight authority of the House of Representatives  tax committee  which oversees the IRS  and deflect Republican accusations of a fishing expedition by Democrats unfairly targeting the president  the sources said  House tax committee Chairman Richard Neal  who has vowed to request Trump s returns  said this week that the long standing audit claim could be the basis on which the committee ultimately decides whether to go to court to obtain the returns   The returns are expected to become an issue soon  A subcommittee of Neal s panel on Thursday set a hearing for Feb  7 on  presidential and vice presidential tax returns   A spokeswoman said the hearing would cover  H R  1   a bill that would require presidential candidates to release their tax records for elections   Another strategy for House Democrats might be to probe whether Trump profited from the Republican tax overhaul that he signed into law in 2017  or how his income could be affected by amendments to the tax code likely to come before the committee in months ahead   No decisions have been made  and sources with knowledge of the discussions could not say how much weight House officials working on the issue might give to any proposal  The deliberations reflect the caution Democrats are taking in launching investigations of Trump  his businesses and his presidency  now that they have majority control of the House   The president has repeatedly said on the campaign trail and then after becoming president  he intended to do this  to release them  except that he was under audit   said Neal  the only House member authorized by law to request Trump s returns from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin   So that s the basis we proceed on   Neal told reporters on Tuesday   If we can t have a voluntary submission  then we use the legal apparatus that s available to us   A Democratic spokesman for the committee declined to comment  A spokeswoman for the Treasury  which supervises the Internal Revenue Service  said Mnuchin will review the legality of any request for Trump s returns with the department s legal counsel  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment    SHALL FURNISH  As the Republican presidential nominee in 2016  Trump broke with decades of precedent by refusing to release his returns  saying they were being audited by the IRS  Many tax experts have replied that an IRS audit does not preclude their release   As president  Trump has retained ownership of extensive hotel interests and other business ventures  For this reason  House Democrats say his returns would be a linchpin for oversight investigations of potential ties between the president and Russia and other conflicts of interest  Federal law gives the chairmen of the House tax panel  the Senate Finance Committee and the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation  the authority to request any return and says that the Treasury secretary  shall furnish  it   Trump and Mnuchin are widely expected to fight any such action  The law has been used to obtain tax records  which are normally held in strict secrecy by the IRS  But in the interests of transparency  modern presidents have routinely disclosed their returns to the public voluntarily  Progressive  NYSE PGR  Democrats and outside groups have ramped up pressure on Neal to act swiftly to obtain Trump s returns and eventually release them to the public   The law is very clear that we re entitled to get those returns   Representative Lloyd Doggett told CNN on Thursday   If the Treasury secretary    refuses to do it  then we will have to take some court action   said Doggett  a senior Democratic member of Neal s Ways and Means Committee   BAD PRECEDENT  Experts say an approach without careful justification could leave Democrats vulnerable to Republican claims of overreach   It sets a very  very bad precedent  If they can demand that the public see the president s tax returns  what s going to keep them from demanding to see anyone s tax returns   said Representative Kenny Marchant  a Republican on Neal s panel

94959,316474,PGR,7  Dividend Moonshots  Ready To Return 17  Every Year,opinion," I did read that  I thought about you  B O  
While other people may be known for their hobbies  or their families  my publisher thought of me when a Vanguard fund re opened 
I ve yapped about the Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund Investor Shares before  I rarely mention  let alone endorse   mutual funds  But VDIGX is notable for two reasons 
I plow 100  of my 401 K  contributions into this fund  andIt s a pretty good option as far as retirement plans go Why this fund  Because in my  Brett Inc   company plan  I have a set list of Vanguard funds to choose from  This is  set and forget  money so my goal is to maximize long term returns  The best way to do this  of course  is to buy dividend growth stocks 
My own portfolio dedicated to this approach has earned 17  per year  I ll share the details with you in a minute  First  let s give some credit to VDIGX 
As far as 401 K  options go  it is a good one  The fund outperformed the S P 77  to 68  over the last five years  It really shines in turbulent years like this one  rallying 23  year to date 
As we discussed at the outset  VDIGX just re opened itself to new money for the first time in three years  But unless you also have a Vanguard 401 K   I think you can do better than VDIGX  Much better  actually  Here s how 
For 17  Returns Per Year  Buy the Fastest Growing Dividends
Dividends drive the stock market  While current yields provide a big part of today s return  it is the growth of these dividends that determines tomorrow s return 
Let s spy on VDIGX s holdings to see how this works  Its number five position  PepsiCo Inc  NASDAQ PEP   has made its investors rich thanks to its ability to grow its dividend  Check out the orange staircase below that s the payout that PepsiCo hikes every year  Its stock price  blue line below  is attracted to the payout curve like a magnet  Here s their relationship since the beverage maker began paying a dividend 
Every Pepsi Payout Refreshes the World




PepsiCo s payout growth has slowed in recent years   No surprise  it s already filled the world with sugar water   Its last dividend raise was only 3   That s the junk food equivalent of pedestrian 3  annual price returns 
I wish Don Kilbride  VDIGX s manager  would trade in this dog  It s weighing down my 401 K  returns  PepsiCo s best years of payout growth are behind it 
Same goes for many Dividend Aristocrats  the stocks that have hiked their dividends for 25 or more consecutive years  They are treated like royalty  so their valuations are always high and their current yields low  It doesn t make sense to reward past accomplishments since the stock market is a forward looking vehicle 
The advantage of handpicking your own stocks is that you can look ahead rather than behind  Show me a company poised to grow its dividend by 17  per year  trust me  they exist  and I ll show you a stock that s likely to rise by 17  each and every year 
How to Identify Tomorrow s Big Payout Raises
Forecasting payouts  of course  is work  So let s start with a shortcut 
The best forward looking dividend growth tool that I am aware of is Reality Shares  DIVCON system  It ranks the dividend payers among the 1200 largest US companies across a variety of fundamental factors  including profitability  earnings growth  cash flow and leverage  As I write these are DIVCON s five favorite stocks 




Sometimes  stock prices  run away  from their payouts  This is a good thing for existing shareholders  of course  though maybe not for new investors who haven t yet bought in  Let s take DIVCON s favorite play  Heico Corporation  NYSE HEI   While its dividend has  only  appreciated 95  over the past five years  its stock price has soared 377  
That s a Heico of a Return




I am sure Heico shareholders are not arguing about the outperformance  However  second place  Landstar System  Inc  NASDAQ LSTR  may be due to catch up  The firm has raised its dividend by 164  over the last five years yet its stock price has  only  rallied 72  
This is where the human element can really add additional value  It s easy for you and me to quickly see the potential for Landstar 
Plus the screens and machines don t see everything  This is often where we can find the best dividend deals  Let me show you one more example before we dive into my seven favorite dividend plays today 
 Special  dividends usually fly under Wall Street s radar  They are technically one time payouts  so we won t see them reflected in a stock s stated yield  But we can identify when these special payouts are made regularly and take advantage of broader income ignorance about them 
Let s take insurer Progressive Corp  NYSE PGR   Its published yield is a sleepy 0 5   But over the last twelve months  the firm has actually dished out a 3 3  yield  based on its current share price   Its dividend is quietly going parabolic  and its share price can t keep up 
Progressive s Payout  Orange  Goes Parabolic




This is the type of dividend stock that you should be considering if you want stocks to make you rich  In fact  safe dividend payers like this can easily double your money every four years or so  That s what 17  yearly returns will do for you 
7 More Stocks for 17  Returns Per Year  Forever
I use computers  screens  tools and my own head to uncover dividend moonshots that will easily pay you 17  per year  That s enough to double your money in just over 4 years 
Imagine  turning a retirement  pot  of  250 000 into  500 000  or   500 000 into  1 000 000  and on it goes

94960,316475,PGR,Tetragon Financial Group  Stronger NAV Returns  But Discount Remains Wide,opinion,"Tetragon Financial Group Ltd  AS TFG  achieved an 8 1  NAV total return in H119  with a 13 3  annualised return on equity  ROE   well within its 10 15  long term target range  While its performance lagged global equity markets over the half year  the resilience of Tetragon s NAV in H218 helped it to achieve a 14 3  NAV total return over the year to 30 June 2019  compared with 6 3  and  3 1  for the MSCI AC World and FTSE All Share indices  respectively  all in US dollar terms  Despite strong NAV returns in 2019  Tetragon s discount remains wide at 48 6   offering significant scope for future narrowing to enhance shareholder returns  while its 5 9  dividend yield leads the AIC s Flexible Investment sector 





The alternative asset market opportunity
Global economic growth has slowed over the past year and uncertainties such as the US China trade dispute and the UK s exit from the EU continue to weigh on growth prospects and stock market sentiment  while changing expectations over central bank easing and Chinese government stimulus have added to equity and bond market volatility  In the current uncertain environment  alternative assets could appeal to investors as a potential source of uncorrelated returns 
Why consider investing in Tetragon 
Diversified alternative asset portfolio has demonstrated ability to deliver uncorrelated positive returns in challenging market conditions 
Brisk pace of third party asset growth at TFG Asset Management 
Robust near  and long term NAV total return performance track record 
Strong net returns mitigate above average ongoing charges 
Progressive  NYSE PGR  quarterly dividend and regular capital returns via tender offer 

Scope for narrowing discount to enhance returns
Tetragon s discount to NAV widened from 38 5  in August 2018 to the current 48 6  as the share price declined with global equity markets towards the end of 2018  with limited subsequent rebound   while its NAV returns have strengthened in 2019  This discount provides significant scope for future narrowing to enhance shareholder returns  Tetragon s quarterly dividend continues to progress steadily higher  and its 5 9  yield is well above the 2 5  peer group average yield 























Strong H119 performance
Tetragon achieved a strong performance in the first half of 2019  with an 8 1  NAV total return and a 6 7  return on equity  ROE    which excludes balance sheet effects  including share dilution from the dividend reinvestment plan and value accretion from the US 50m tender offer completed in January 2019  While performance lagged broad equity market returns   the MSCI AC World and FTSE All Share indices recorded total returns of 16 6  and 12 9  in US dollar terms in the half year   Tetragon s returns in H119 were the strongest in the last five years  and significantly higher than its 2 7   Libor 2 65   incentive fee hurdle rate 
Net investment gains were US 197 2m in H119 and fair value net income was US 145 7m  which compares with US 144 6m and US 104 3m respectively in H118  Annualised ROE for the half year was 13 3   well within Tetragon s 10 15  pa long term target range  and higher than the ROE achieved in each of the last five financial years  range  6 3  to 12 1  on a like for like basis   although not challenging the 47 7  and 36 1  ROEs achieved in 2010 and 2011 
All asset classes in the portfolio generated positive returns in the period  except for other equities and credit  where direct balance sheet equity investments recorded an US 11 5m loss  primarily from unrealised losses on US and European single stock positions that are still held  TFG Asset Management generated the largest net investment gain of US 91 2m  predominantly from Equitix  US 57 3m  and LCM  US 18 3m   while hedge fund strategies also generated a significant US 45 1m net investment gain  principally from the Polygon European Equity Opportunity Fund  which contributed US 41 3m from the absolute return and long bias strategies combined 
Tetragon s net asset value increased by US 73 1m  or 3 3   to US 2 262 5m during H119  net of the US 50 0m tender offer and US 22 3m cash dividend payments in the period  As illustrated in Exhibit 2  NAV per share rose by US 1 46  or 6 5   to US 23 94  with the tender offer being 2 2  accretive on a per share basis  as the shares were repurchased at a substantial discount  Exhibit 1  





Looking at the drivers behind the more significant gains in the half year  the US 57 3m gain on Equitix resulted from a combination of performance  capital raising and accelerated capital deployment  Equitix closed its Fund V at  1 0bn in Q219    250m higher than the original capital raising target  with the expectation that the fund will be fully invested by the end of 2019  which represents an acceleration of the business plan  This fund raising took assets under management  AUM  to US 6 0bn  from US 5 0bn at the start of the year  In addition  the discount rate applied in the discounted cash flow valuation of Equitix was reduced from 9 75  to 9 50  in the period 
The US 18 3m gain on LCM reflected a combination of continued growth in AUM and favourable movements in market valuation metrics  AUM increased from US 8 3bn to US 9 1bn during the half year  with EBITDA up 50  compared with H118  While the discount rate applied in the discounted cash flow valuation of LCM was unchanged at 11 5   the price to AUM multiple was moved up to 2 5   from 2 3  at the end of 2018 
Tetragon posted a US 41 3m gain on its investment in the Polygon European Equity Opportunity Fund following the recovery from the fund s weak performance in H218  This was assisted by corporate M A activity  with the acquisition of the fund s largest portfolio holding  Evry  by its competitor Tieto  announced in June 2019  Furthermore  the fund s performance was supported by positive returns in the European markets  with the STOXX Europe 600 index up nearly 16    especially Greek equities  Athex index was up 41 6  in H119   While the portfolio hedge attributable to the absolute return share class was a detractor in H119  a net return of 11 2  was achieved  with no down months  while the long bias share class returned a net 21 4  
New investments  cash and borrowings
During H119  additions to Tetragon s portfolio totalled US 154 0m  with allocations fairly evenly spread  US 24 7m to US 39 1m  across hedge fund strategies  bank loans  real estate  private equity  and direct equities and credit investments  In particular  US 32 2m was added to direct equity investments  US 30 5m to private equity funds and co investments  and US 30 0m was added to the investment in the Polygon European Equity Opportunity Fund absolute return strategy  US 24 7m was drawn by CLO investment vehicle TCI III  while no new direct investments were made in LCM or non LCM CLOs 
For the half year  Tetragon s portfolio income and disposal receipts totalled US 181 0m  including US 45 5m from GreenOak Asia funds  with the realisation of the Razorback investment  a 13 storey office property in Tokyo  contributing the majority of the US 25 9m real estate gains in the period  Other significant receipts were US 48 1m from US CLO bank loan investments  primarily non LCM CLOs   arising from natural amortisation as well as planned monetisation via optional liquidations  US 43 7m from Equitix and US 22 0m from exiting direct listed equity investments 
During the six months to end June 2019  Tetragon s net cash position declined by US 93 1m to US 178 2m  which represents 7 9  of net assets  This decline was largely driven by the US 50 0m share repurchase in January 2019 and cash dividend payments totalling US 22 3m  At end June 2019  Tetragon s future cash commitments amounted to US 193 1m  comprising hard and soft investment commitments  GreenOak US 64 3m  TCI III US 58 9m  Hawke s Point US 44 8m and third party private equity funds US 25 1m   with additional financial resources required to cover ongoing dividends and fees  Net investment income is expected to provide additional financial resources to fund these commitments and Tetragon also has a US 150 0m revolving credit facility in place  of which US 38 0m was drawn at end June 2019  unchanged since end 2016 
Dividends and share dilution
During the half year  Tetragon s US 0 1825 per share Q418 and Q119 dividends were paid  with the total distribution amounting to US 32 2m  of which US 22 3m was paid in cash  The balance of US 9 9m was reinvested under Tetragon s optional stock dividend plan  resulting in 0 7m shares being issued from treasury  The Q219 dividend was increased to US 0 1850 per share  continuing the historical pattern of the quarterly dividend being increased in the second and fourth quarters and held steady in the first and third quarters  this is payable to shareholders on 27 August 2019 
Tetragon s fully diluted share count reduced from 97 4m to 94 5m during the first half of 2019  The primary contributor to the net 3 1m shares decrease was the US 50m tender offer for 4 3m shares that was completed in January 2019  This was partly offset by 0 6m shares vesting under equity based compensation awards and 0 7m shares being issued as scrip dividends 
Discount  Moderately wider than historical averages
As illustrated in Exhibit 3  left hand chart   Tetragon s share price discount to NAV narrowed steadily from its five year wide point of 56 3  in February 2016 to 32 8  in December 2017  but has subsequently followed a widening trend  While the current 48 6  discount is appreciably wider than its three  and five year narrow points of 32 8  and 30 3   it is only moderately wider than its one   three   five  and 10 year averages of 45 0   41 0   42 2  and 41 0  respectively  Exhibit 3  right hand chart  clearly illustrates the divergence between Tetragon s share price and NAV total return performances from August 2018 to December 2018  when Tetragon s share price broadly followed the decline in global equity markets  although to a lesser extent   in noticeable contrast to the stability of its NAV over the period  This serves to highlight the uncorrelated nature of the returns that can be achieved by Tetragon s diversified alternative asset portfolio relative to equity markets 





Peer group comparison
Exhibit 4 shows a sterling based comparison of Tetragon with the other 10 members of the AIC Flexible Investment sector that have a market cap of more than  100m  The investment mandates of the peer group funds vary widely  with none serving as a direct comparator for Tetragon  but the peer group average provides a broad context for comparison  Tetragon s NAV total return is clearly ahead of the peer group average over one  three and five years to end June 2019  and more than double the return of the second ranked fund over 10 years  US dollar strength versus sterling   3 7    5 0    34 3    29 4   respectively over one  three  five and 10 years to end June 2019  had a positive effect on Tetragon s performance in sterling terms over all periods shown 
Despite its near  and long term relative outperformance  Tetragon s share price discount to NAV is the widest in the peer group  Several other funds are also trading at substantial discounts  while three of the peers are trading at a premium to NAV  Tetragon s ongoing charge is among the highest in the peer group and it is one of four funds that charge a performance fee  Similar to the majority of its peers  Tetragon has no corporate level net gearing  Helped by the recent widening of its discount  Tetragon s dividend yield has risen to 5 9   which is the highest in the peer group  more than double the 2 5  average yield  We note that if Tetragon s discount was to fully unwind  its shares would yield c 3 0   which would rank third highest in the peer group ",2019-08-14,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tetragon-financial-group-stronger-nav-returns-but-discount-remains-wide-200454977,200454977

94983,316498,PGR,Gears of WTO Could Soon Halt Amid U S  Concerns  Canada Warns,news," Bloomberg     The operation of the World Trade Organization may soon stall because of U S  delays in appointing new judges  Canada s trade minister said as he prepares to convene another round of reform talks in Davos 
Jim Carr  in an interview with Bloomberg s Kathleen Hays in Tokyo  said the U S  refusal to appoint judges to the appellate body of the 164 nation WTO means that in  the next number of months  the WTO s dispute settlement system will effectively stall  That lends urgency to talks set to take place on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos this week 
 The most urgent problem is the dispute settlement mechanism  Without any new judges being appointed  the gears are going to come to a halt  They re going to slow down  and it will not be good news   Carr said 
This week s talks will be missing representatives from the U S  and China  the world s two largest economies  as other nations try to navigate the giants  trade fight   You re not going to have a durable and lasting reform of the WTO unless you have China and the United States involved  You can t start there  though  But that s where we re going to have to end up   Carr said 
The trade minister s comments come amid rising trade tensions globally  which have trade reliant Canada    the world s 10th largest economy  for which exports make up about a quarter of gross domestic product    caught in the middle 
Canada  at the request of the U S   arrested a Huawei Technologies Co  executive on Dec  1  a move that has triggered a bitter  rising feud with Beijing  President Donald Trump has mused that he may abandon the case against the executive if he reaches a satisfactory trade deal with China  blurring the lines between trade posturing and law enforcement 
 Unacceptable  Sentence
China has since seized two Canadians    former diplomat Michael Kovrig  and tour operator Michael Spavor    and sentenced a third  Robert Schellenberg  to death in a drug case after initially sentencing him to a prison term  Canada is seeking the release of Kovrig and Spavor and a more lenient sentence for Schellenberg 
China and Canada are in a  tough patch  of a deep  longstanding relationship  Carr said  He called Schellenberg s sentence  unacceptable  but said the countries will continue to work together 
 This is not a relationship that began yesterday  It goes back decades  It s sophisticated  it s multilayered   he said  adding   So we have to talk about the ongoing  continuing commercial relationship between these two countries  and a way through sorting out the current problem  
 Butchers Matter 
Carr spoke in Japan  the largest economy in the 11 nation Comprehensive and Progressive  NYSE PGR  Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership  or CPTPP trade deal  Canada is the second biggest  Formerly the TPP  it was saved after Trump pulled the U S  out of the deal shortly after he took office 
The first countries that ratified the CPTPP deal made their first two rounds of tariff cuts to start the year  Carr said there are  very positive reports already   particularly among Canadian beef  pork and cereal producers  and that other countries are expressing interest  publicly and otherwise  in joining the pact 
 I was at a supermarket earlier in the day in Tokyo and talked to a butcher about selling Canadian beef in Tokyo  We have this great picture of a four year old with a Canadian flag eating a piece of Canadian beef  and a butcher holding up this big slab of Canadian tenderloin   Carr said   So  butchers matter  
U K  Trade Talks
Canada continues to watch Brexit proceedings    the U K  is Canada s biggest European trading partner  and thus the crown jewel of an EU Canada trade deal that provisionally kicked in in late 2017 
After Brexit  Canada and the U K  aim to reach some kind of deal to  essentially  copy and paste the EU trade deal over with tweaks  There are  continuing discussions both at the official level and at the political level with the U K  to make sure everybody understands where everybody else is coming from   Carr said 
As soon as possible after the U K  exit from the EU   we would like to sign an agreement with the U K  which would be like the EU agreement  But we have to see what the conditions are   Carr said  He said the U K   despite not being a Pacific Rim nation  would also be welcome to apply to join the CPTPP 
 If they want to apply  and are prepared to meet the standards  of course they would be considered   he said ",2019-01-20,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/gears-of-wto-could-soon-halt-amid-us-concerns-canada-warns-1751992,1751992

countries to ratify it  including Canada  Japan and Australia  CPTPP s real prize  Canadian exporters say  are reduced Japanese tariffs for beef  pork  wheat and canola oil  Japan is the world s third largest beef importer and seventh largest wheat buyer  often buying top quality supplies to meet consumer demand for soft  white breads and beef raised on grain not grass   For Canada  following a

enthusiasm about Canadian beef transcended borders    The interest was as high as I ve ever seen   said Dennis Laycraft  executive vice president of the Canadian Cattlemen s Association  who has been

tariffs boost any product s competitiveness in Japan in the long run  but short term  preferences for specific brands as well as a country s supply capacity  are also factors  said an official at Japan s farm ministry  who was not authorized to speak publicly   Canada  the world s sixth largest beef exporter overall  is the second biggest shipper after the United States of grain fed beef

reducing Japanese tariffs  Japan typically buys 1 5 million tonnes of high quality Canadian wheat annually  but that volume may approach 3 million tonnes over the next nine years  predicted Cam Dahl

Energy Company   NYSE DTE   Buy These 5 Stocks with Impressive Sales Growth Right AwayStrong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market  The companies that put more emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage  as strong sales generally get converted into growth Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings while assessing growth of a business  This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base Flat or declining sales growth indicates obstacles at the company and offers limited scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors Without impressive sales growth  bottom line improvement may not be sustainable over the long term  While a company can show earnings strength by lowering expenses  a sustainable bottom line usually requires robust sales growth However  sales growth in isolation doesn t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits Hence  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments For the rest of this Screen of the Week article

95051,316566,PGR,Heard on the grapevine  How Pacific trade pact primes New Zealand wine for Japan buzz,news,"By Leika Kihara and Charlotte Greenfield TOKYO WELLINGTON  Reuters    From sleepy New Zealand hillsides to sleek Tokyo dining scenes  a bottle of Hawke s Bay wine shipped to Japan traces an arc that exporters like Nigel Avery see as an avenue for multi million dollar growth built on a free trade pact  Avery s Sileni Estates hopes to gain as the two countries are among a group of 11 ringing the Pacific Ocean that have carved out a tariff busting deal  just as the United States and China remain enmeshed in trade disputes and business in Europe is racked by Brexit  Even without the United States  pulled out of the accord by President Donald Trump  the Comprehensive and Progressive  NYSE PGR  Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership  CPTPP  covers an area that houses more than a tenth of the world economy  That opens tantalizing prospects for niche industries like Malaysian rubber  Australian beef and New Zealand s wine trade  now coveting affluent drinkers in Japan  Tokyo begins cutting its 15 percent import tariff on New Zealand wine on Dec  30  with full elimination set for 2025  But to boost growing if tiny sales in what the U S  Department of Agriculture estimates is a  1 6 billion import business  New Zealand producers may have to invest heavily in promotions to beat dominant European players  importers in Japan say  At Sileni  which says it s among the top 10 New Zealand producers by volume  Avery is convinced of the potential to boost sales   As the  Japanese  market matures   because they are heavily  Old World  consumption   they start to become a bit more explorative  they ll stumble across New Zealand for sure and once people stumble across our wines they really like them   said Avery  chief executive of his family s business since 2016  Still  European vintners are in no mood to sit back and will soon have a trade deal of their own   a sweeping accord to reduce tariffs between the European Union and Japan set to kick in as soon as February 2019   The trade agreement will boost our exports to Japan and will enhance our position as export leaders   said Jean Marie Barillere  President of E U  wine lobby CEEV  in a statement after the deal won European Parliament backing on Dec  12      A LOVE AFFAIR Japan s love affair with wine blossomed with its rise as an economic power in the 1980s and has endured  In a University of Adelaide study  Japan ranked 5th in the world by share of global spending on wine in 2015  Exports of New Zealand wine to Japan are small   but steadily increasing amid growing demand in the restaurant trade  Sales of what wine writer Curtis Marsh has called  honest wines that over deliver in price quality rapport  have almost doubled in Japan in the last nine years  to NZ 14 million   9 61 million   according to industry body New Zealand Winegrowers  compared with U S  shipments of more that NZ 500 million  Starting from scratch around 2003  Sileni has made Japan its second biggest overseas market after the United States  where Avery  a former Olympic weightlifter  headed up business before taking over from his father  Without disclosing sales volumes  Avery said that unlike many other markets that favor New Zealand sauvigon blancs and pinot noirs  Japanese consumers had diversified taste  Sileni sent about 15 different types of wines there  he said  Most of the New Zealand wine sold in Japan isn t on supermarket or convenience store shelves  It features on menus in high end restaurants in Japan  seen by customers as offering a comparatively cheaper but good quality alternative to luxury French brands      MORE THAN  40 A BOTTLE   CHEAPEST ON MENU On a recent Friday night in central Tokyo s upscale Azabu area  restaurant Torizen Seo served customers from a menu centered on gourmet versions of traditional grilled chicken skewers  or  yakitori   Sileni wines at 4 800 yen   42 70  a bottle were the cheapest on a mostly European list  with bottles around 7 500 yen to accompany dinner courses priced at 5 000 8 000 yen  Industry insiders say Japanese wine lovers like Tomoko Inaba are increasingly looking to extend their palates into wines from New World countries that are pushing what they say are innovative flavors in less traditional restaurants and hotels   For the same price  you get higher quality buying a New Zealand wine than you would for a French wine nowadays   said Inaba  a 49 year old office worker   Considering the quality  New Zealand wines are reasonably priced   said Inaba  who previously favored French wines  Zero tariffs for New Zealand wines could in some cases mean a cheaper price point  For others  it may boost profits which can be poured back into marketing  for example in tie ins with Japan s hosting of the 2019 Rugby World Cup  where New Zealand s team will start among the favorites to win   You need an event  a trigger  to draw more attention to New Zealand wine   said Koichi Kaino  executive officer at major wine importer Enoteca  which has been bringing Sileni to Japan for more than a decade   One way is to promote New Zealand wine together with food  like grass fed New Zealand beef   The message that differentiation is needed for niche players in CPTPP countries to boost exports is key  according to Makoto Kinjo  president of ANZCO Foods Japan  a unit of New Zealand meat producer ANZCO Foods  
 New Zealand can t compete with big wine exporting countries by volume or pricing   said Kinjo   I think New Zealand wine exporters understand that  If you re a minority in terms of market share   You need to do something different from your competitors  ",2018-12-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/heard-on-the-grapevine-how-pacific-trade-pact-primes-new-zealand-wine-for-japan-buzz-1727027,1727027

95070,316585,PGR,First American Financial  FAF  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of First American Financial  FAF   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6 4  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  58 65 in the previous session  First American Financial has gained 29 3  since the start of the year compared to the 13 4  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 6 6  return for the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 25  2019  First American Financial reported EPS of  1 58 versus consensus estimate of  1 35 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 67  
For the current fiscal year  First American Financial is expected to post earnings of  4 86 per share on  5 91 billion in revenues  This represents a 15 99  change in EPS on a 2 79  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 02 per share on  5 98 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 3 46  and 1 14   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
First American Financial may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
First American Financial has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 11 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 9 6X versus its peer group s average of 13 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 08  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  First American Financial currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if First American Financial passes the test  Thus  it seems as though First American Financial shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does First American Financial Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of First American Financial have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including NMI Holdings  NMIH   Fidelity National Financial  FNF   and The Progressive  PGR   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 38  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for First American Financial  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/first-american-financial-faf-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200447056,200447056

95087,316602,PGR,Taiwan president quits as party chair after local election setback,news,"By Yimou Lee and Jess Macy Yu TAIPEI  Reuters    Taiwan President Tsai Ing wen resigned as chairwoman of the ruling pro independence Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  DPP  after it suffered a major electoral defeat on Saturday  losing two of the island s most important city posts in mayoral elections  The results of the polls  being held just over a year before Taiwan s next presidential election  are likely to please China  which claims self ruled and proudly democratic Taiwan as its own and has ramped up pressure on Tsai and her administration since she took office in 2016  In the run up to the elections  Tsai and her government said repeatedly that China was trying to sway voters with  political bullying  and  fake news   accusations that Beijing denied  The DPP lost control of the mayoralties in Taiwan s second most populous city Taichung and the key battleground of Kaohsiung in the south  which it held for two decades and played a central role in Taiwan s pro democracy movement in the 1970s  Both were won by the China friendly opposition  the Kuomintang  which once ruled China before fleeing to Taiwan at the end of a civil war with the Communists in 1949  Tsai said the DPP would reflect on the defeat  but she vowed to press on   Continuing reforms  freedom and democracy  and protecting the country s sovereignty are the mission that the DPP won t abandon   she told reporters  She said she would not accept the resignation of her premier William Lai  who had offered to quit earlier in the evening   TRAGIC DEFEAT  The DPP has now been left in control of only six of Taiwan s cities and counties  compared with at least 15 for the Kuomintang  The party held on in two of its other strongholds  however  keeping Tainan in the south and Taoyuan in the north   This is a tragic defeat for the DPP   Yao Chia wen  a senior adviser to the president  told Reuters    But this is not support for the Kuomintang from the people  This is the people s disappointment in the DPP   he said  citing slower than expected initiatives that have drawn criticism including pension and justice reforms  Votes were still being counted in Taiwan s affluent capital Taipei  where the incumbent mayor Ko Wen je  an independent  is in a close race with the Kuomintang s Ting Shou chung  and the DPP is running a distant third  Kaohsiung s Kuomintang mayor elect  Han Kuo yu  who described the city as  outdated and poor  while on the campaign trail  told a rally he would go all out to boost its economy   We must immediately roll up our sleeves and get to work   Han said  speaking of what was once one of the world s busiest ports but which has lost much of its business to China   There was no immediate reaction from Beijing to the poll results  where state media simply noted Tsai s resignation as party chairwoman  to take responsibility for the party s performance in Taiwan s local elections   A spokesperson for the U S  State Department praised Taiwan for  demonstrating the strength of their vibrant democratic system through a successful round of elections   HIGH TURNOUT Taiwan television stations reported a high turnout  with some polling stations in parts of Taipei and Kaohsiung remaining open past 4 p m  0800 GMT  when the polls were due to close  Candidates fanned out across the island to shake hands and canvass votes  and held noisy  colorful rallies that have become the hallmarks of Taiwan s vibrant democracy  in marked contrast to China where the Communist Party tolerates no dissent to its rule  Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have heightened  with China conducting military drills around the island and snatching away Taiwan s dwindling number of diplomatic allies  Tsai s domestic reform initiatives  from the island s pension scheme to labor law  have also come under intense voter scrutiny recently  Confidence in the government has waned in recent months after reform moves upset both the opposition and some supporters  who said Tsai had backed away from promises to reduce the deficit and cut pollution

s pro independence ruling party in local elections  emboldening the China friendly opposition  one of whose main figures says he will now reach out to Beijing to forge more friendly ties  The ruling Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party  DPP  suffered major elections loss on Saturday  losing two key mayoral races  while the opposition Kuomintang took or retained control of 15 cities and counties  leaving the DPP with only six  With little more than a year before presidential elections  Taiwan President Tsai Ing wen  who has had tense relations with Beijing since her election in 2016  on Saturday took responsibility for her party s losses and resigned as DPP chairwoman  The Kuomintang mayor elect of the southern port city of Kaohsiung  formerly a DPP stronghold  moved swiftly on Saturday night to reach out to China  telling local media he will set up a working group on China relations and will break down barriers   We have no walls around our hearts   said Han Kuo yu  who has previously described Taiwan independence as being  more scary  than syphilis  The Kuomintang has sent delegations to China since Tsai took office  where they have been warmly received  China has refused to have direct contacts with Tsai s administration   China  which claims Taiwan as a wayward province  said the elections showed people wanted peaceful relations with Beijing   The results reflected the strong will of the Taiwan public in hoping to continue to share the benefits of the peaceful development of relations across the Taiwan Strait  and their strong wish in hoping to improve the island s economy and people s wellbeing   said a statement by China s policy making Taiwan Affairs Office and carried by state media  Taiwan s Mainland Affairs Council said China should respect Taiwan s internal affairs and democracy and not  interpret the expectations of Taiwan s people toward relations across the Taiwan Strait   In an implicit warning to China not to contact newly elected Kuomintang officials  the council said deliberately political Chinese approaches to local governments and people would not help  positive interactions  with Taiwan   Voters also rejected a referendum that would have seen the island join the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as Taiwan  rather than  Chinese Taipei   a move which would have angered Beijing  China s Taiwan Affairs Office said it showed voters  putting Taiwanese athletes  interests at stake is against people s will    The attempts of  Taiwan independence  are doomed to fail   it added  The WeChat account of the overseas edition of the Communist Party s official People s Daily said Han had realized one important reality   Taiwan will only be good if relations across the Taiwan Strait are good   China is suspicious that Tsai wants formal independence  a red line for Beijing which regards Taiwan as its own  Tsai says she wants only the status quo with China  but will defend Taiwan s security  Chinese law mandates the use of force to prevent the island from seceding  Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have heightened with China conducting military drills around the island and snatching away Taiwan s dwindling number of diplomatic allies  DPP Secretary General Hung Yao fu  asked on Saturday about whether the China factor had played a role in influencing the elections  reiterated there had been a problem with  fake news    I think this time was a deep lesson  in terms of fake news messing up with a lot of people s judgment or not getting clear information   he told reporters    This is a global problem not just Taiwan s unique problem   SPECIAL MARRIAGE EQUALITY LAW Taiwanese voters on Saturday also rejected a referendum on legalizing same sex marriage  another blow for Tsai  who in her 2016 campaign promised marriage equality  However  she has made little progress on the issue  In an Asian first  Taiwan s constitutional court declared in May of last year that same sex couples had the right to

What s Next for Progressive

95133,316648,PGR,Abe Sets Agenda As G20 Leaders Head To Osaka,opinion,"Security is being massively upgraded  Tiger suited local matrons are rapping welcome songs  and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has laid out a hopeful agenda for the G20 summit  which takes place in the port city of Osaka on Friday and Saturday 
The timing of the summit  amid trade tensions and jitters in the Middle East  comes just weeks before elections for Japan s Upper House  and offers Abe the possibility of upbeat pre election optics 
Though seen by some as an ultra nationalist  Abe has sought to prize open Japan s economy with free trade agreements with the EU and 11 Asia Pacific economies  He has promoted nascent immigration policies and focused on inbound tourism 
The G20 is the first of three high profile international events set to take place in Japan this year and next  the second and third being the Rugby World Cup  from September to November this year  and the Tokyo Summer Olympics in 2020 
Eyes on Trump
The talking shop of the world s 20 richest countries will be in and around the Intex Osaka convention center on the city s waterfront  Some 37 leaders of countries and international organizations are scheduled to attend  Guests will include the big three   US President Donald Trump  Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin 
Given current global developments  all eyes are expected to be on Trump  He has said he will be meeting with Xi   to discuss the ongoing trade war  and possibly developments in North Korea  following Xi s state visit to meet with Kim Jong Un last week 
Political discussions are also likely to be at the fore when Trump meets Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan 
Abe  in a syndicated editorial picked up by global media today  laid out his agenda for the two day pow wow  He focused on three issues  maintaining the international trade order  upgrading digitization  cross border  and tackling global pollution with innovative solutions 
On free trade  he talked up the China sponsored Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership  RCEP   a free trade agreement linking the 10 member Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN  with six Indo Pacific states  Australia  China  India  Japan  South Korea  and New Zealand  
 Those discussions have gone on for some time   Abe wrote  urging his fellow Asia leaders to get moving   We must now make a dash toward the goal line  
The RCEP  if signed  ratified and implemented  would be the world s largest free trade area  though India fears an influx of cheap Chinese goods  and Australia and New Zealand want labor and environmental clauses worked in 
Rival trade deals
Abe s promotion of the China led RCEP comes with the Japan led  11 nation Comprehensive and Progressive  NYSE PGR  Agreement for the Trans Pacific Partnership  or CPTPP  already in effect   minus the United States  which pulled out in one of US President Donald Trump s first acts in office  It has been speculated that if RCEP gets up and running  leaving US producers and farmers out in the cold  Washington might rethink joining CPTPP 
The Japanese leader  who faces security concerns with North Korea and China  has leaned closer than any other world leader to Trump  but the two are at odds over free trade  Trump s withdrawal from TPP was seen as a humiliation for Abe  and Trump now seeks a bilateral free trade agreement with Japan  which Tokyo has agreed to negotiate with some reluctance 
Still  Abe diplomatically did not take a swipe at Trump  reserving his ire instead for the World Trade Organization   A quarter century has passed since the WTO was established   he wrote   During that time  the world economy has changed at amazing speed  However  the WTO has failed to keep up  and the adverse effects of this are becoming increasingly apparent  
The WTO has been in deadlock since the failure of the Doha Round of negotiations in 2001  leading to nations and economic blocs to form bilateral and multinational trade agreements  Abe wondered how to make the WTO  relevant again as a guardian of free and fair international trade  
Abe offered modern Asia  as a vision for the prosperity that free trade brings   The region s economies have benefitted from the free flow  in and out  of people and goods   He specifically mentioned ASEAN without mentioning China or South Korea   countries with which he has a more conflicted relationship  largely over historical issues 
Abe s second item   digitalization  had he said   enabled unprecedented business models  but has also brought new challenges  such as double non taxation for multinational companies  We can resolve such issues only through international co operation  
To enable cross border data transfers   Japan is advocating a system of data free flow with trust  or DFFT  which would allow the free flow of data under rules upon which all can rely   he wrote   The process for doing that is what we call the  Osaka Track   which we hope to launch at the upcoming summit  
Abe s third agenda item   like his first  is hardly a key Trump priority   is  the importance of innovation in tackling global environmental challenges  
Noting that global warming goals  are not achievable through regulation alone   Abe called for  disruptive innovation that flips something negative into something positive  
He raised the possibility of turning CO2 from a liability to a resource  and cited such innovative technologies as artificial photoysynthesis   In Osaka  I want the G20 to confirm the importance of such innovation   he wrote  adding that in October  Japan will host a global conference on environmental innovation 
Abe   who has been criticized in China and slammed in South Korea for refusing to fully acknowledge Japan s wartime past  but has largely been free of such attacks in Southeast Asia   finished with a parting shot on future focus 
He quoted a slogan   If you have time to look back  then move forward instead    That positive attitude was a way of life for the generations of postwar Japanese who brought about our rapid economic growth   he wrote   By the 1980s  that attitude had spread across the ASEAN region  
This future focus  he wrote   is a way of life for broader Asia   that is  for the entire Indo Pacific  And a self confident Japan is a Japan that is well suited to contribute to creating Asia s future  
Osaka prepares
Osaka  the industrial port where the two day summit will be held  is known for its 16th century samurai castle  its inner city canals  its tradition of street food  and the jokey nature of residents and its large community of Korean migrants 
The city gained some cinematic fame with Ridley Scott s beautifully shot East West thriller  Black Rain   While that 1989 film focused on US cops taking on a rogue Yakuza gangster  Japan remains one of the safest countries in the world  but city officials are taking no chances 
Some 32 000 police from 46 prefectures are being deployed to ease congestion  tamp down possible protests or terror concerns  In an anti terrorist move  coin operated lockers and trash cans at rail stations in western Japan have reportedly been shut down  irking commuters will have to lug luggage around with them until the summit concludes on Saturday  Tourists may be also be disappointed by being unable to access the iconic  gull winged Osaka Castle  which is expected to be used as a backdrop for G20 events 
Some 700 schools in the city will close on the summit days in order to reduce congestion  according to local press reports  though the city government is urging residents to stay off the streets  Heavy traffic  and possible flight delays  are anticipated at Kansai and Itami airports 
 The Funniest City in the World 
But not all are irked by the anticipated inconveniences  An Osaka based group of elderly women   Obachaaan  has produced and posted on YouTube a rap video to hail the incoming heavy hitters 
The video   Oba Funk Osaka  is in English  Its lyrics include  Let s talk  Let s dance  Here is Osaka wonderful city  
An Obachan  Kyodo news agency explains  is Japanese for an older lady    and Osaka Obachan are noted for being loud  witty  talkative and friendly  
The video features local grannies  in tiger print threads  dancing in the streets and extolling the virtues of what they insist is  The funniest city in the world  
Alas  as far as Asia Times is able to tell  no world leader has passed comment yet  or attempted the Oba Funk dance  Maybe they should give it a shot

95134,316649,PGR,Total Wipeout  What Can Ottawa Teach Us About Westminster Politics ,opinion,"Opinion polls suggest a  total wipeout  for the Conservative and Labour parties if a general election was held tomorrow  the 1993 Canadian Federal election offers some clues about what that would mean for  outsider  political parties   and sterling 
Opinion polls have been a fickle friend to investors in recent years  paying too much attention to polling would have been a mistake in the run up to 2017 general election  while paying too little attention to opinion polls would have been a mistake in the run up to the UK s Brexit referendum in 2016 
We therefore need to consider recent polling data with a huge dollop of caution  However  it is worth pointing out how spectacularly badly the two main political parties have done since the European Parliament elections on 23rd May 
The two party vote share has dropped to just 40  in recent polling  The blue line in the chart below is the equivalent vote share in the monthly average of UK opinion polls since 1945  taken from Mark Pack s Pollbase database  The red dots are the same two party vote share at general elections  There is no post war precedent for the two main parties polling consistently below 50  between them 

In terms of general election results  you have to go back to 1918 to find an occasion when Labour and the Conservative party pulled in less than 50  of the vote 
The only vague parallel is the rise of the SDP Liberal Alliance in the early 1980s  which peaked very briefly at 50  of the vote share but only won 23 out of the 650 seats in the 1983 general election  However  it is not a foregone conclusion that these political earthquakes disappear with a whimper 
The potential shake up in the composition of parliament with an election under these conditions should not be underestimated given the non linearities inherent in a first past the post system  I ve been reading up on the 1993 Canadian election  when the governing Progressive  NYSE PGR  Conservative party fell from 156 out of 295 seats to just 2 despite leading in the polls six weeks before the election 
It s worth pausing to reflect on that result  The Progressive Conservatives were the mainstream party of the centre right  founded over 50 years previously  They went from first  in 1988  to fifth  in 1993   Having been in government for nine years  they lost 99  of their seats  It wasn t a political earthquake  it was a political supernova 
Third party ascent
What s the lesson here  UK opinion polls currently show a four way tussle between the Brexit party  the Conservatives  Labour  and the Liberal Democrats  A first past the post system can throw up highly unusual results in that environment  small differences in vote share can translate into wild differences in the share of seats 
Consistent with that  bookmakers are pricing the probability of a third party becoming the largest force in Westminster after the next general election at 15   To put that in context  that is marginally higher than the implied probability of anyone other than Liverpool or Manchester City winning the 2019 20 Premier League  Spurs  Arsenal and Manchester United fans will try to convince you that the Premier League is more than a two horse race  If they are even half right  Westminster politics is wide open in a way that has not been true since the start of the 20th century  As Leicester City s victory in 2015 16 showed us  we have to keep our eyes and minds open to seemingly outlandish results 
Why should we care  Most obviously  there is a currency angle to think about  a higher dispersion of potential political outcomes should drive a higher risk premium in sterling denominated assets  Broadly speaking  our funds have enjoyed a significant tailwind from holding non sterling assets as these political risks have escalated  The question we constantly need to be asking is whether we have now hit  peak political uncertainty   Our judgement is that we are now reaching that point and GBP based investors should consider scaling back their non sterling risks ",2019-07-05,Legal & General Investment Management,https://www.investing.com/analysis/total-wipeout-what-can-ottawa-teach-us-about-westminster-politics-200437223,200437223

95159,316674,PGR,Progressive  PGR  Stock Moves  1 07   What You Should Know,opinion,"Progressive  PGR  closed at  79 28 in the latest trading session  marking a  1 07  move from the prior day  This change was narrower than the S P 500 s 1 32  loss on the day  Elsewhere  the Dow lost 1 41   while the tech heavy Nasdaq lost 1 51  
Prior to today s trading  shares of the insurer had gained 6 06  over the past month  This has outpaced the Finance sector s loss of 4 91  and the S P 500 s loss of 5 09  in that time 
PGR will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release  On that day  PGR is projected to report earnings of  1 35 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 13 45   Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  9 21 billion  up 15 38  from the prior year quarter 
For the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of  5 20 per share and revenue of  37 71 billion  which would represent changes of  17 65  and  16 43   respectively  from the prior year 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for PGR  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   It has a remarkable  outside audited track record of success  with  1 stocks delivering an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 49  higher  PGR currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Valuation is also important  so investors should note that PGR has a Forward P E ratio of 15 42 right now  For comparison  its industry has an average Forward P E of 13 81  which means PGR is trading at a premium to the group 
We can also see that PGR currently has a PEG ratio of 2 1  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  PGR s industry had an average PEG ratio of 1 41 as of yesterday s close 
The Insurance   Property and Casualty industry is part of the Finance sector  This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 47  putting it in the top 19  of all 250  industries 
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups  Our research shows that the top 50  rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1

95161,316676,PGR,Can Value Investors Pick Progressive Corporation  PGR  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Progressive Corporation   NYSE PGR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Progressive Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 42  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 79  However  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Progressive Corporation s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint of 16 45 over the past five years The stock s PE however compares unfavorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 98  This indicates that the stock is quite overvalued right now  compared to its peers Now  Progressive Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16  which is slightly lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Progressive Corporation stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Progressive Corporation has a P S ratio of 1 43  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 22x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Progressive Corporation currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Progressive Corporation a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Progressive Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives PGR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been bullish  The current quarter has seen five upward revision versus no downward revisions over the past sixty days  while the full year estimates have seen seven upward and one downward revision in the past sixty days This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has shot up 9 8  over the past two months  while the full year estimate has surged 4 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Progressive Corporation Price and Consensus   Such bullish analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineProgressive Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Also  a quite strong industry rank  among Top 18  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2 instils optimism in the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance  good industry and Zacks ranks and a signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in PGR Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire

95173,316688,PGR,Harvey hits insurance stocks as loss estimates surge to  20 billion,news,"By Tim McLaughlin and Tom Sims BOSTON FRANKFURT  Reuters    Hurricane Harvey s whipsaw of wind and rain across Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast hurt the shares of U S  property and casualty insurers on Monday as Wall Street analysts estimated insured losses as high as  20 billion   That would make it one of the costliest storms in history for U S  insurers  but could ultimately help insurers and reinsurers to raise rates  some analysts said  after a period of low premiums    Our best guess at this point is Harvey could result in  10 billion to  20 billion of industry insured losses  making it one of the top 10 most costly hurricanes to hit the United States   JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  analyst Sarah DeWitt said in a research note on Monday   Swathes of Houston were underwater on Monday  the effect of Harvey sweeping ashore on Friday as the most powerful hurricane to hit Texas in 50 years  It has since been downgraded to a tropical storm  but more rain is expected to fall on the fourth largest U S  city  Damage caused by flooding is not included in standard homeowners insurance policies and is covered by the U S  government  However  flood damage to businesses is covered by commercial policies  said DeWitt  which could result in  meaningful losses for the commercial reinsurers and insurers    JPMorgan s and other estimates are currently well below the  75 billion in insured losses caused by Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans in 2005  but are likely to grow   Shares of Travelers Companies Inc and Allstate Corp  NYSE ALL   two of the largest homeowners insurers in Texas  fell 2 6 percent and 1 5 percent respectively on the New York Stock Exchange  Shares of Progressive Corp  NYSE PGR   a large auto insurer in Texas  fell 2 3 percent  STABILIZE RATES  Harvey struck only days before senior insurance executives hold their annual meeting in Monte Carlo to haggle over reinsurance renewals as premiums remain stubbornly low across the industry   We think Harvey could help stabilize global reinsurance pricing  but do not expect a major turn in pricing to follow   Kai Pan  an insurance analyst at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   said in a research note on Monday   Property and casualty insurance stocks tend to underperform immediately after a catastrophic storm  but often beat the overall market once loss estimates become more accurate and insurers are able to stabilize or raise premium rates  By contrast  insurance brokerage stocks  such as Marsh   McLennan Cos Inc  tend to rise immediately after a storm because such companies are not exposed to underwriting risk and a rise in premium rates boosts their commission income  Shares of Marsh   McLennan  which bought one of the largest insurance brokerages in Texas in 2015  closed up 0 5 percent on Monday   EARLY ESTIMATES  Houston is facing worsening flooding in the coming days as the storm dumps more rain on the city  swelling rivers to record levels and forcing federal engineers on Monday to release water from reservoirs in an effort to control the rushing currents  Swiss Re said it is too early to gauge the full impact   There are so many areas that have been hit by devastating winds and now the massive flooding  and insurance adjusters are having to wait for first responders to simply check on the safety and welfare of citizens   said Mark Hanna of the Insurance Council of Texas   Claims are expected to accelerate once Texas residents get their bearings   We have just over 2 000 claims across all lines of business   said Farmers Insurance Group spokesman Trent Frager   While that may sound low  residents who are evacuated haven t  yet  been able to assess and report damage for claims handling

95175,316690,PGR,Hurricane Irma could test Florida s private flood insurance market,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn  Reuters    Hurricane Irma could test a nascent private flood insurance market in Florida that some advocates say is a model for making U S  flood coverage more affordable and commonplace in high risk areas  Florida s private flood insurance market represents a tiny sliver of all flood policies in the state  but if a hurricane does hit Florida later this week  policyholders  industry and the federal government will see how private insurance performs in one of the country s largest flood prone markets   It s a new breed of insurance in Florida   said Loretta Worters  a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute  an industry funded communications group   You have these companies that have never been tested for flood  We ll have to see how it works   Even before Hurricane Harvey triggered massive flooding in Texas last week  U S  lawmakers were looking at alternatives to the indebted government backed model of flood insurance   The National Flood Insurance Program  NFIP   which owes  24 6 billion to the U S  Treasury  is set to expire on September 30  It is the only source of flood insurance for most Americans because the risk of flooding is so high it makes it too costly for typical insurers to sell  A Florida law in 2014 simplified the process for setting premium prices  enabling private insurers to sell different types of flood policies in the state  opening up the market  Some advocates for reforming the program are pushing for additional changes to U S  regulations that they say will spur more Americans to buy private coverage including making private flood policies suitable as a condition for home loans  Some flood reform advocates  however  argue against letting private flood insurers into the market  because they say they will cherrypick the most profitable risks and leave the NFIP to deal with the rest  Florida has more than 1 7 million NFIP policies in force  representing about 35 percent of all NFIP policies  according to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation and Federal Emergency Management Agency data  But more than one million homes at risk for storm surge damage in six of Florida s riskiest metropolitan areas are not covered by flood insurance  according to an analysis of data from analytics firm Corelogic by the FAIR Foundation  a Fort Lauderdale  Florida based non profit group involved with flood policy issues  That is because the homes are located in areas that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  has not designated as having the highest flood risk  a designation that triggers the mortgage requirement to buy insurance  said Jay Neal  FAIR Foundation president and chief executive officer   The only way to address that insured risk is to have the private market participate   said Neal  who also heads the Florida Association for Insurance Reform  a coalition of insurers and other business groups  Insurers see opportunity in that untapped market  Nearly 30 insurers are offering various types of private flood insurance coverage in Florida  including units of American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG   Chubb  NYSE CB  Ltd  Progressive Corp  NYSE PGR  and HCI Group Inc  according to the regulator s website  Insurers are buying reinsurance from companies such as Renaissance Re  Validus Re and XL Catlin to hedge the risk   More than 20 000 private market flood policies were in force in Florida as of June 30  said Florida s insurance regulator  Hurricane Harvey s punishing blows to Houston has spawned interest in private flood insurance among Floridians  even before the chances of Hurricane Irma hitting Florida increased  said Josh Butts  and insurance agent who owns Cornerstone Insurance Inc in Tampa

95190,316705,PGR,Buy These 5 Stocks With Impressive Sales Growth Right Away,opinion,Investors often do not consider sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to selecting stocks  However  solid sales are necessary to drive growth  and most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise Sales are income generated by a company through business activities  Though a company might not be profitable over a particular time period  it usually generates revenues In cases when companies tend to incur loss on a temporary basis  they are valued on the basis of revenues and not on earnings  This is because sales growth  or decline  is usually an early indicator of the company s future earnings performance While sales growth is an important metric for growth projections and strategic decision making  this in isolation doesn t indicate too much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits Hence  a consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and further potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy P S Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are

95194,316709,PGR,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Progressive  PGR ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Progressive  PGR   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Progressive currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if PGR is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this insurer holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For PGR  shares are up 5 84  over the past week while the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 79  compares favorably with the industry s 2 75  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Progressive have risen 10 72   and are up 29 17  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 3 72  and 6 92   respectively 
Investors should also take note of PGR s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  PGR is averaging 3 039 174 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with PGR 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost PGR s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 99 to  5 21 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that PGR is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Progressive on your short list ",2019-05-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-progressive-pgr-200423953,200423953

95206,316721,PGR,FACTBOX Previous U S  health reform efforts,news,"WASHINGTON  May 27  Reuters    Congress is tackling an
overhaul of the  U S  healthcare system  which President Barack
Obama hopes to sign into law by the end of the year 
 Following is a timeline of previous U S  health reform
efforts 
  1912  Theodore Roosevelt endorses health insurance as part
of his presidential bid on the Progressive Party ticket 
Roosevelt  who served as a Republican president between 1901
and 1909  loses the election 
  1930 1939  President Franklin D  Roosevelt considers
national health insurance as part of his New Deal reforms  but
decides it is too politically risky to include in his Social
Security Act  which sets up benefits for the elderly and the
unemployed 
 An effort to pass health insurance on its own falls short
in Congress  which grew weary of federal government expansion 
  1943  The War Labor Board rules that a wage freeze
designed to keep inflation in check during World War II does
not apply to health insurance benefits  creating an incentive
for employers to provide health insurance as a way to build
worker loyalty 
  1945 1949  President Harry Truman s attempts to set up a
national health program are thwarted by opponents who cite it
as socialism and racial desegregation 
  1954  The Revenue Act of 1954 excludes employer
contributions to health plans from taxable income  creating
further incentives for employer based health insurance 
  1965  In the most significant health reform of the
century  President Lyndon Johnson signs into law the Medicare
health program for the elderly and the Medicaid program for the
poor and the disabled 
  1970s  Though support for greater healthcare coverage is
widespread  momentum dissipates during the Watergate scandal 
Soaring inflation  economic recession and rising healthcare
costs further blunt reform 
  1993  President Bill Clinton crafts a detailed plan
calling for universal coverage that relies largely on
competition between private insurers  with government
regulation to control costs  Clinton s fellow Democrats in
Congress are divided and determined opposition from Republicans
and business interests kill it 
  1997  The State Children s Health Insurance Program covers
families with children who have modest incomes but are not poor
enough to qualify for Medicaid  In the ensuing decade 
President George W  Bush vetoes two attempts to expand funding
for the program  but President Barack Obama signs an expansion
into law in 2009 
  2003  The Republican controlled Congress expands Medicare
to cover prescription drug costs through private insurance 
Health Savings Accounts allow those in high deductible plans to
set aside pretax dollars to pay for care 
  2007  Bush proposes replacing the current preference for
employer sponsored insurance with a standard healthcare
deduction  but Congress does not act on the plan

95207,316722,PGR,Iceland opposition to submit rival EU plan   paper,news,"REYKJAVIK  May 27  Reuters    Iceland s parliamentary
opposition parties plan to submit a joint proposal with their
own conditions for opening accession talks with the European
Union  an Icelandic newspaper reported on Wednesday 
 The Independence Party parliamentary group has mandated its
leader Bjarni Benediktsson to seek agreement with the other side
of the opposition  the Progressive Party  to present a proposal
in the Althing  parliament  on Thursday  the daily Morgunbladid
reported on its website 
 The proposal could muddy the waters for the island nation s
parliament after its government on Monday presented its EU
application proposal to the Althing 
 The opposition wants the Althing s foreign affairs committee
to play a key role in the preparations  instead of the cabinet 
as suggested by the government  the report said 
 Support for negotiations on EU membership  and ultimately
the adoption of the euro currency  has risen following the
economic meltdown that ensued after Iceland s banks collapsed
under the weight of massive debts last year 
 A spokesman in the prime minister s office said on Monday an
EU application could be submitted as early as July

95237,316752,PGR,UPDATE 3 U S  Nov trade gap shrinks on record import plunge,news," Updates market action 
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON  Jan 13  Reuters    The U S  trade deficit
shrank nearly 29 percent in November  the largest decline in 12
years  as weak consumer demand and plummeting oil prices caused
imports to sink by a record amount 
 The  40 4 billion trade gap was the lowest since November
2003  the Commerce Department said in its monthly report on
Tuesday  and another sign of how the global financial crisis
has damaged world commerce 
 Both U S  imports and exports declined for the fourth
consecutive month after hitting record peaks in July 
  It really says the wolf is at the door  Americans aren t
buying anything   said Ed Gresser  director of the Progressive
Policy Institute s trade office   The problem isn t
competition  but lack of demand for anybody s product  
 The much smaller than expected deficit could trim slightly
estimates of how much the U S  economy contracted in the fourth
quarter of 2008  analysts said 
 But with the report showing consumer demand falling sharply
at home and abroad  it is hard to call it good news  said Nigel
Gault  chief U S  economist with Global Insight in Lexington 
Massachusetts 
  It is slim comfort that the U S  cut its demand for
imports more rapidly than the rest of the world cut its demand
for U S  exports  That might cushion the U S  downturn a
little  but it is not a route to recovery   Gault said 
 U S  stocks fell for the fifth straight day on Tuesday as
investors fretted over what many expect will be a gloomy
earnings season  Treasury bond prices eased on revived hope of
government action to shore up the value of risky assets like
mortgages and corporate bonds 
 The dollar soared to a one month high against the euro
 on the trade data  but was unchanged against the yen
 in late trading 
 U S  imports in November fell a record 12 percent to  183 2
billion as the global financial crisis scared businesses and
consumers into cutting their spending 
 U S  exports fell 5 8 percent in November to  142 8
billion  Total U S  goods exports were the lowest since June
2007  while auto and auto part exports were the lowest since
October 2006 
 Imports of both capital and consumers goods were the lowest
since mid 2006  while auto and auto part imports fell to levels
not seen since August 2003 
 The average price for imported oil plunged a record  25 30
per barrel in November as recession fears deepened  Along with
the drop in prices to  66 72 a barrel  the average daily volume
of U S  oil imports fell 1 7 million barrels 
 Oil prices have continued to fall since November 
suggesting even smaller trade gaps in the months ahead 
  The beauty part is that the trade deficit will shrink as
much in the next couple of months because oil prices fell at a
pretty constant rate   said Christopher Low  chief economist at
FTN Financial in New York 
 Imports from China fell by a record  5 7 billion  or nearly
17 percent  in November  Even with that sharp decline  the U S 
deficit in goods trade with China totaled  23 1 billion  more
than half the overall monthly trade deficit 
 The U S  trade gap with China totaled  246 5 billion
year to date through the end of November  putting it on the
cusp of surpassing the record  256 3 billion set in 2007 
 The overall trade deficit totaled  630 9 billion through
November  down from  642 7 billion in the same period last
year  reflecting strong export growth earlier in 2008

95238,316753,PGR,UK s Brown  should have done more to prevent crisis  paper,news,"LONDON  March 17  Reuters    British Prime Minister Gordon
Brown  lagging in opinion polls  said on Tuesday he wished he
had done more to impose better regulation earlier and took full
responsibility for his role in the economic crisis 
 In an interview with the Guardian newspaper  the former
finance minister also said he could not rule out further
economic stimulus in April and said the pure free market era
was over 
 Brown s Labour Party is trailing the opposition
Conservatives in most opinion polls and the Prime Minister has
come under fire in recent weeks from opposition politicians who
want him to apologise for not seeing the economic downturn
earlier 
  I take full responsibility for all my actions   he said 
in what the paper described as his fullest defence of his role
in the recession and failure to apologise for it 
  But I think we re dealing with a bigger problem that is
global in nature  as well as national   he told the newspaper 
under the headline  I should have done more to prevent bank
crisis  
  Perhaps 10 years ago after the Asian crisis when other
countries thought these problems would go away  we should have
been tougher     keeping and forcing these issues on to the
agenda like we did on debt relief and other issues of
international policy  
 The Bank of England has cut interest rates and the
government launched a host of policies to boost the economy but
Brown is still expected to lose the next election  due by
mid 2010  according to analysts 
 In what the Guardian described as a bid to launch a
political fightback  Brown also said it was  essential for the
sake of the country  that Labour wins a fourth term in power 
 He said the 40 year old prevalent orthodoxy known as the
Washington consensus in favour of free markets had come to an
end 
  Laissez faire has had its day   he said   The centre left
and the progressive agenda should be confident enough to say

95239,316754,PGR,INTERVIEW Dubai s Jumeirah sticks to growth plan  eyes India,news,"  Still committed to expansion plan despite downturn
   Aims to tap growing tourism demand in India
 By Tamara Walid
 DUBAI  April 7  Reuters    Dubai based Jumeirah Group is
still aiming to manage 60 hotels by 2012 and is looking at
expanding into India to tap into growing tourism demand in the
region  a company executive said on Tuesday  
  We are     currently involved in a number of discussions
within the subcontinent   Executive Chairman Gerald Lawless said
in an emailed statement to Reuters 
 Jumeirah said last October it was expecting to operate 60
properties either in operation or under development by 2012 as
it looks to move away from its home market in the United Arab
Emirates and rival other global international hotel operators 
 The luxury hotelier  owned by Dubai s ruler  said it was
still  committed  to its global expansion programme despite the
global financial downturn 
 The firm  famous for managing the sail shaped Burj al Arab
hotel in Dubai  was interested in Indian cities including
Mumbai  Delhi and the state of Goa for hotel and resort
projects  Lawless said 
  With the progressive economic development in India    
there has been a clear increase in demand for luxury hotels for
business as well as leisure   Lawless said 
 The travel and tourism sector is expected to contribute 6
percent  some  67 3 billion  to India s gross domestic product
in 2009  according to a report by the World Travel   Tourism
Council  WTTC  
 Globally  travel and tourism GDP is expected to contract by
3 6 percent in 2009 and remain weak in 2010 with marginal growth
of less than 0 3 percent  data released by WTTC showed 
 Jumeirah  which operates 11 hotels including the Carlton
Tower in London and Essex House in New York  delayed plans to
open its first hotel in China in January after the financial
crisis hit the Asian nation  slowing down travel activity in the
country  ID nHKG19258  
 Jumeirah missed its original target to open the planned
338 room Jumeirah Han Tang Xintiandi Hotel in downtown Shanghai
in late 2008  re scheduling the launch of the hotel to later
this year

95251,316766,PGR,AFG Vs  PGR  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Insurance   Property and Casualty sector have probably already heard of American Financial Group  AFG  and Progressive  PGR   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Currently  both American Financial Group and Progressive are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
AFG currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 87  while PGR has a forward P E of 14 61  We also note that AFG has a PEG ratio of 1 94  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  PGR currently has a PEG ratio of 1 99 
Another notable valuation metric for AFG is its P B ratio of 1 84  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  PGR has a P B of 3 80 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to AFG s Value grade of A and PGR s Value grade of C 
Both AFG and PGR are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that AFG is the superior value option right now ",2019-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/afg-vs-pgr-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200416596,200416596

95291,316806,PGR,Progressive  PGR  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Progressive in Focus
Headquartered in Mayfield Village  Progressive  PGR  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 28 06  so far this year  The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of  2 61 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 38   This compares to the Insurance   Property and Casualty industry s yield of 1 51  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 89  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 61 is up 132  from last year  Progressive has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 22 31   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Progressive s payout ratio is 25   which means it paid out 25  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for PGR for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 07 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 14 71  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  PGR is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/progressive-pgr-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200407629,200407629

95296,316811,PGR,Top 5 ROE Stocks To Buy On Better Than Expected Q1 Earnings,opinion,The earnings season has unfolded on a relatively promising note  with better than expected performance dispelling widespread recessionary fears  Buoyed by the renewed optimism and encouraging trends from the hitherto declared results  the equity markets are currently trading near record highs and appear well poised to continue the uptrend As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios  like return on equity  ROE    A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  A Key MetricROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow lesser than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for  1 of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength    Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform

95316,316831,PGR,Progressive  PGR  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Progressive  PGR  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 16  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 38 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 1  
Revenues are expected to be  8 88 billion  up 18 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 78  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Progressive 
For Progressive  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 09  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Progressive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Progressive would post earnings of  1 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 44  delivering a surprise of  56 44  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Progressive appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/progressive-pgr-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200405134,200405134

What s Next for Progressive 
While Progressive has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Progressive was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

95361,316876,PGR,Bull Of The Day  The Progressive Corporation  PGR ,opinion,"The Progressive Corporation  NYSE PGR   PGR  has seen its shares climb 21  so far this year and it looks poised for double digit top and bottom line growth in 2019  Progressive is also a solid dividend payer that has been on a strong run over the last few years 
Overview 
Progressive is the third largest auto insurer in the U S   behind only State Farm and Geico  and ahead of Allstate  ALL   with over  30 billion in premiums written in 2018  The company boasts roughly 11  of total market share and offers insurance for both personal and commercial automobiles  trucks  motorcycles  boats  recreational vehicles  and more  Progressive is also in the home insurance business and allows its customers to bundle auto and property together 
As we mentioned at the top  Progressive is a strong dividend payer  The company also operates a relatively unique system when it comes to returning value to its shareholder  Progressive pays an annual variable dividend  with the annual amount calculated based on the firm s insurance operating performance for that particular year  The insurer paid out a dividend of  2 51 per share most recently  with a dividend yield of 3 48   This looks impressive against the Insurance   Property and Casualty industry s yield of 1 6  and the S P 500 s 1 97  yield 
Furthermore  Progressive has increased its dividend four times during the last five years for an average annual increase of 17 12   On top of its annual variable dividend  Progressive just recently announced that it will start to pay a quarterly dividend  which will begin at  0 10 a share   We believe we ve been great stewards of capital here at Progressive  and we certainly expect to continue to be   Progressive CFO John Sauerland said on the company s fourth quarter earnings call 
 As a reminder  we produced returns on common shareholder equity in the high teens over many periods  including the past 20 years  We ve also returned 70  of net income in the form of dividends or share repurchases  
Outlook   Earnings Trends 
Now that we have covered some of Progressive s business and why it is a solid stock for income investors  it s time to see what to expect from the company going forward  Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the company s Q1 fiscal 2019 revenue to jump 18 5  from the year ago period to reach  8 86 billion 
For the full year  Progressive is projected to see its revenue surge 16  to hit  37 55 billion  Peeking even further ahead  the company s top line is expected to climb roughly 11  above our current year estimate in fiscal 2020 
At the bottom end of the income statement  Progressive also seems ready to post double digit year over year growth  PGR s adjusted current quarter EPS figure is projected to jump nearly 15  to reach  1 40 a share  Meanwhile  the company is expected to post similar growth for its adjusted full year earnings  and its 2020 figure is projected to climb roughly 8  above 2019 s estimate 
Investors should also note that Progressive s earnings estimate revision activity has trended upward recently  PGR s 2019 and 2020 consensus earnings estimates have popped 5  over the last 90 days  This movement is important to monitor because it has been proven over the years that earnings growth leads to positive stock price movement over the long haul 
 
 
Bottom Line
Clearly at least some analyst are more bullish on Progressive s longer term earnings outlook  which helps the company earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  at the moment  The insurer also sports a  B  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  And Progressive is trading with at P E of 14 2  which is not too far above its industry s average 12 8 average 
Progressive stock opened trading Friday at  71 72 a share  just slightly below its 52 week high of  73 78  Shares of PGR have surged 21  in 2019 to outpace the S P 500  The company s stock price has also soared over 100  during the last three years as it expands its business

95362,316877,PGR,Why Progressive  PGR  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that PGR is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-03-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-progressive-pgr-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200397271,200397271

95430,316945,PGR,This Is Why Progressive  PGR  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Progressive in Focus
Progressive  PGR  is headquartered in Mayfield Village  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 9 45  since the start of the year  The insurer is paying out a dividend of  2 51 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 81  compared to the Insurance   Property and Casualty industry s yield of 1 6  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 51 is up 123 1  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Progressive has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 17 12   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Progressive s payout ratio is 25   which means it paid out 25  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for PGR for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 01 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 13 35  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  PGR presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  ",2019-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-progressive-pgr-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200383680,200383680

95469,316984,PGR,5 Incredible Dividend Growth Stocks Under  100,opinion,"Amid volatility and uncertainty  investors are honing in on stocks that not only offer dividends but also consistently increase their payout  This strategy leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields  Investors should note that dividend paying securities are the major source of consistent income  when returns from the equity market are at risk Why Dividend Growth Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the

95510,317025,PGR,Progressive  PGR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Progressive  NYSE PGR  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 01 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  27 9  
Revenues are expected to be  8 51 billion  up 19 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 42  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Progressive 
For Progressive  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 57  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination indicates that Progressive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Progressive would post earnings of  1 14 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 57  delivering a surprise of  37 72  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Progressive appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/progressive-pgr-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200376204,200376204
95512,317027,PGR,Will Solid Premiums Push Up Travelers  TRV  In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,The Travelers Companies  Inc    NYSE TRV   is slated to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Jan 22 before the market opens  In the last reported quarter  the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 14 41  Let s see  how things are shaping up for this announcement The property and casualty  P C  insurer is likely to report premium growth  driven by an improved pricing environment  high levels of retention  a positive renewal premium change as well as substantial growth across its businesses  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums in fourth quarter 2018 is pegged at  6 9 billion  up 7 6  from the year ago quarter s consensus mark When it comes to Personal Insurance business  the probable uptick in premiums came on the back of a continued successful execution in Agency Auto and growth in Agency Homeowners Further  the insurer s Business Insurance segment is anticipated to deliver a more than modest performance  primarily fueled by higher earned premium volume and a lower tax rate  Travelers  commercial businesses are projected to perform well in the yet to be reported quarter on the back of better pricing  prudent strategy execution as well as market stability Riding on rising interest rates  the company might have experienced solid investment results in the fourth quarter  Higher private equity returns as well as average level of fixed maturity investments have likely driven investment income  In the fourth quarter of 2018  the insurer estimates the metric to increase in the  60  65 million range compared with the band recorded in the same period of 2017  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at  654 million  representing an 8 8  increase on a year over year basis On the back of higher premiums and investment income  the company is likely to witness top line growth in the quarter to be reported  Also  a consistently successful execution of marketplace strategies coupled with strong production results might have led to this probable upside  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  7 7 billion  reflecting a year over year rise of 4 1  Further  a lower tax incidence and steady share buybacks are likely to have boosted the P C insurer s bottom line in the fourth quarter The fourth quarter is expected to bear the brunt of Hurricane Michael  occurring in October  and California wildfires  in November   With the P C insurer s presence in California  the company is estimated to incur a certain level of catastrophe loss in the yet to be reported quarter  Exposure to catastrophe loss might induce volatility and hamper the company s overall performance However  with the reinsurance coverage in place  Travelers anticipates to mitigate the losses suffered in the aforementioned time period Nonetheless  underwriting results are projected to benefit from higher levels of earned premium  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the combined ratio in the Insurance segment during the fourth quarter is pegged at 96   flat from the prior year quarter s figure However  a higher debt level causing a probable escalation in interest expenses can put pressure on the margin expansion What Our Quantitative Model StatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that Travelers is likely to beat on earnings this to be reported period  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below Earnings ESP  Travelers has an Earnings ESP of  4 61   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at  2 16  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 26  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our    The Travelers Companies  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Zacks Rank  Travelers carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which lowers the predictive power of ESP  We caution against Sell rated stocks  4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderSome

95541,317056,PGR,U S  Agricultural Exports To Japan Set To Plunge,opinion,"The US left the TPP when Trump took office  The world moved on  It s now the CPTPP  Some call it the anti Trump pact 
US farmers are about to take a big export hit as the Trans Pacific Pact  TPP moves on without the US  It s a new world order  and the US isn t involved 
Please consider Pacific states launch bold trade pact  shaping world order as America retreats 

Eleven countries are pressing ahead with the Comprehensive Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership  CPTPP   defying barely disguised efforts by the Trump Administration to kill the treaty 
A vanguard of Japan  Singapore  Mexico  Australia  Canada  and New Zealand activated the treaty over the weekend  ripping down barriers to trade in almost all goods  It eliminates 18 000 tariffs  and slashes others in stages over coming years 
The great irony is that the US itself drafted much of the original text under the Obama Administration  aiming to ensure that Washington writes the rules of global trade and commerce in the 21st Century  not Beijing 
The pact opens up trade in services on the basis of equal treatment  It cuts the costs of customs clearance  rules of origin  and compliance to a minor friction 
The White House assumed that the TPP would wither on the vine without US impetus  Instead  long standing US allies across the Pacific have brushed off pressure from Washington and forged ahead regardless with what is now known as the  anti Trump pact  
 America is the biggest loser   says the Peterson Institute in Washington  The fall in food tariffs under the CPTPP means that US farmers will be undercut by exporters from Australia  Canada  and New Zealand in the lucrative Japanese market  Wheat from Canada will be  70 cheaper per metric tonne by 2020 
The latest twist is that Chinese officials have begun to explore the possibility of joining the pact that was supposed to exclude them  prompting a polite though wary riposte from the founding members 
Beijing is alarmed by clauses in the revamped Nafta deal for North America that gives the US an effective veto if either Canada or Mexico wish to sign a future trade deal with a  non market economy   clearly meaning China  Membership of the CPTPP would help to circumvent this legal clause  Precisely for this reason the Trump Administration would fight Chinese accession tooth and nail 

U S  Farmers Fear Lucrative Japanese Exports Will Wither
The Wall Street Journal reports U S  Farmers Fear Lucrative Japanese Exports Will Wither 

After seeing exports to China tumble  U S  farmers and ranchers are now bracing for more losses in their next biggest Asian market  Japan 
On Dec  30  Tokyo will begin cutting tariffs and easing quotas on products sold by some of American agriculture s biggest competitors including Canada  Australia  New Zealand and Chile as part of the new 11 member Comprehensive and Progressive  NYSE PGR  Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership 
The U S  was originally part of that bloc  but President Trump pulled out last year  saying the agreement would have harmed American manufacturers and workers by loosening restrictions on U S  imports of autos and auto parts  and intensifying competition with low wage Asian nations 
Tokyo will follow up on Feb  1 by implementing the European Union Japan Economic Partnership Agreement offering similar breaks for the 28 country bloc s agricultural products  aiding American rivals in France  Spain  Italy and the Netherlands 
Japan  unlike China  isn t moving to block U S  goods by retaliating for Trump administration tariffs  Instead  it s doing the opposite  accelerating an ambitious market opening agenda with more than three dozen countries spanning the globe excluding the U S  that have unified to demonstrate to a skeptical Washington the advantages of free trade  and the costs of shunning it 
But the effect will be similar  Japan s new free trade push  threatens to cut into U S  market share and depress profits for U S  agricultural exporters by granting preferential access to   international competitors   the Trump administration s Agriculture Department warned in a May report 
By April 1  exporters from the EU and TPP will face a 26 6  Japanese tariff for chilled and frozen beef  compared with a 38 5  tariff for Americans  while paying a 13 3  duty on prepared pork  versus 20  for Americans 
Some producers say they re already losing business as a result  Kevin Smith  a vice president at Seaboard Foods LP  a Kansas based pork producer  said his company is  already seeing a decline  as longtime customers  develop new supply chains so they can be fully prepared to take advantage of the tariff reduction opportunities  

Not a Free Trade Agreement
For starters  neither CPTPP nor TPP was a free trade agreement  It s ludicrous to call it such  26 6  tariffs are proof enough 
Yet  US agricultural exports will undoubtedly dive because the US will face 38 5  tariffs by Japan 
Trump will now have to execute bi lateral trade agreements 
What might Japan want  How about lower tariffs on cars for starters

95569,317084,PGR,Can Progressive  PGR  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Progressive  PGR   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 23 95   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Progressive was expected to post earnings of  1 14 per share  but it reported  1 57 per share instead  representing a surprise of 37 72   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 08 per share  while it actually produced  1 19 per share  a surprise of 10 19  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Progressive  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Progressive currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 74   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 23  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-progressive-pgr-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200370719,200370719

95591,317106,PGR,Trovagene  TROV  Stock  Providing New Cancer Treatment Options With Onvansertib,opinion,We all know what cancer is  The debilitating  often life threatening condition can be incredibly difficult to treat  As a result  new therapies are being developed in an effort to bring improved treatment options to patients  especially for some of the toughest to treat cancers  That s where Trovagene  Nasdaq    comes in with their drug candidate  Onvansertib Trovagene caught my attention after the company released data from a Phase 1b 2 clinical trial of Onvansertib for the treatment of patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia  AML   Through the ongoing Phase 1b segment of the trial  the company is working to identify the maximum tolerated dose of Onvansertib in patients with AML who are ineligible for induction therapy or who have relapsed or refractory disease  The recently released data proved to be very promising  not just from a safety and tolerability perspective  but Importantly  there are signs that Onvansertib  in combination with standard of care chemotherapy  may be benefiting patients  based on the preliminary anti leukemic activity they are seeing in the dose escalation phase of this trial What Is Onvansertib Onvansertib is a first in class  3rd generation  oral and highly selective Polo like Kinase 1  PLK1  inhibitor  There are a few key attributes that set Onvansertib apart from other drugs used to treat patients with AML today Orally AdministeredOnvansertib is a capsule that is taken orally once a day  so it is easy and convenient for patients Relatively Short Half LifeThe half life of Onvansertib is only 24 hours  This may prove to be an important attribute  as the short half life may reduce the potential toxicity and adverse events in patients that receive the treatment  To date  only mild to moderate side effects have been reported Highly Selective for PLK1Onvansertib inhibits PLK1  This is a master regulator of cell proliferation and is over expressed in a wide range of cancer types  including leukemias  lymphomas and solid tumor cancers  Through the inhibition of PLK1  Onvansertib causes mitotic arrest in prometaphase  ultimately leading to tumor cell death Synergistic in CombinationOnvansertib has demonstrated synergy when combined with numerous chemotherapies and targeted therapeutics  which makes it attractive for use across a number of types of cancer where it can be combined with already approved drugs  What this means is that when you combine Onvansertib with other drugs to treat cancer  the total effect of the drugs is greater than the sum of the individual effects of each drug  TROV is targeting cancer indications where there is a significant medical need to provide patients with new treatment options One of the indications being targeted is Acute Myeloid Leukemia  also known as AML  AML tumors are liquid tumors and are incredibly difficult to treat  In fact  there are approximately 20 000 new cases every year  with 10 400 deaths occurring annually and a 5 year survival rate of about 25   That means only 1 out of every 4 patients diagnosed with the condition will live for a period of five years or longer  Additionally  for patients with relapsed or refractory AML  there are limited  if any  effective treatments currently available  All things considered  there is an overwhelming medical need for new treatment options to treat patients with AML The Recently Released DataAt the recent American Society of Hematology  ASH  conference  TROV announced positive safety and preliminary efficacy data from the Phase 1b 2 clinical trial of Onvansertib for the treatment of patients with AML who are not eligible for induction therapy or who have relapsed or refractory disease  While we will briefly review all of the data presented  I wanted to start with a patient case from the trial that demonstrates the potential value of this new targeted therapeutic The patient is a 75 year old male who was first diagnosed with AML back in 2009 and treated with induction chemotherapy  In March of 2018  the patient relapsed  and he was enrolled in the Onvansertib clinical trial in April of 2018  When he first met with his hematologist oncologist Dr  Amer Zeidan  the lead investigator on the trial  this patient was so ill that he was wheelchair bound  finding mobility nearly impossible In the clinical trial  the patient was treated with Onvansertib  at an entry dose of 12 mg m2 in combination with Decitabine  At the beginning of his sixth treatment cycle  the Onvansertib dose was increased to 18 mg m2  To date  the patient continues on treatment  now in his eighth cycle  By the end of the fourth cycle he had achieved a partial response   the percentage of leukemic blast cells in the bone marrow had decreased from 94   at the time of screening  to 2  by cycle 7  Correspondingly  leukemic blast cells in the blood also decreased from 92  to 4   This is a significant response to treatment  Importantly  he has also tolerated treatment with Onvansertib very well We often tend to focus on the data from a binary perspective in articles like this one  forgetting about one of the most important outcomes of any treatment  That outcome is the quality of life for the patient  Treatment in Trovagene s AML trial has made a meaningful difference on his quality of life  No longer too weak and ill to require a wheelchair  he is walking into the clinic for his visits with Dr  Zeidan  smiling and interacting with everyone  and perhaps most telling is that he has been able to resume meaningful activities  including attending an annual golf tournament during the summer About The Trial Design And Key ObjectivesIn Phase 1b  the primary objective is to assess the dose limiting toxicities  DLTs   determine the maximum tolerated dose  MTD  of Onvansertib and identify the recommended Phase 2 dose  RP2D   The Phase 2 segment of the trial will continue to assess the safety and tolerability of Onvansertib and will also evaluate the clinical activity of the combination regimen  TROV is also evaluating pharmacodynamic and diagnostic biomarkers associated with response to treatment to help identify patients who are more likely to respond to treatment The patients being included in the trial are either deemed ineligible to receive induction therapy of they have relapsed or refractory AML  Albeit still early in the trial  Onvansertib in combination with either low dose cytarabine  LDAC  or Decitabine  may prove to be a new treatment option for these patients  who have few  if any  viable options currently available The Data Is EncouragingThe data presented by TROV is encouraging in many respects  Here s what we saw So far  Onvansertib is proving to be safe and well tolerated among the patient population in the trial  To date  there have been no therapy related deaths  or therapy related serious adverse events  In fact  the data indicate that the only adverse event possibly related to Onvansertib was Grade 1 nausea in 4 patients  The table below lists all adverse events that have been reported to date from the ongoing trial  However  it is important to note that most events are considered to be unrelated to Onvansertib Although the Phase 1b segment of the trial is focused primarily on assessing the safety of Onvansertib  it is encouraging to see the early data associated with anti leukemic activity  which will be more of the focus in the Phase 2 portion of the trial  Of the 19 patients that were evaluable for safety  12 had an evaluable bone marrow biopsy to assess anti leukemic activity  Here s a quick breakdown of the anti leukemic assessment that was provided in the recent poster presentation at the 60th American Society of Hematology  ASH  Annual Meeting Partial Response   A partial response has been achieved in one patient  the 75 year old patient that was described above   This is confirmed by the significant decrease in both circulating and bone marrow blast cells Stable Disease   9 of the 12 patients achieved stable disease  Stable disease means that since patients started treatment  there has not been progression in leukemic activity Progressive  NYSE PGR  Disease   Finally  2 of the 12 patients showed progressive disease  This means that  while treatment was provided  their disease has continued to progress  and thus treatment on the trial was discontinued  It s important to keep in mind that it s likely these patients were on sub therapeutic doses  as the Phase 1b is a dose escalation trial and the dose level that will be considered the recommended Phase 2 dose has not yet been reached All in all  this data is very promising  It shows that  in one of the most difficult to treat liquid tumor cancers   AML  A benefit has been demonstrated in more than 80  of the patients treated with Onvansertib in combination with LDAC or Decitabine All in all  the data demonstrates that not only is Onvansertib proving to be safe and well tolerated  the combination treatment is showing anti leukemic activity  albeit it is still early in the trial  With a greater than 80  patient benefit  it appears that TROV may be onto something here Breaking Through The DataLet s step back for a minute and think about what TROV has achieved here  Onvansertib is in the early stages of clinical development  but even in these early days  the drug is showing great promise Because AML is so difficult to treat  there are many patients for whom there are few  to no  effective options for treating their cancer  However  Onvansertib data show that  80  of patients treated to date have experienced a favorable response to the drug  While TROV is still early in the development of Onvansertib  this data is encouraging Onvansertib May Have Potential Across a Number of Cancer TypesThroughout the conversation today  we ve talked about how Trovagene s Onvansertib could be changing how we manage the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML  In addition to AML  TROV is also evaluating Onvansertib in combination with Zytiga   abiraterone acetate  prednisone in a Phase 2 trial in patients with metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer  mCRPC   As in the case of AML  Onvansertib has demonstrated synergy when used in combination with Zytiga  and the goal of this trial is to stabilize disease in patients who are showing early signs of disease progression while taking Zytiga   As a third indication  TROV is planning to initiate a Phase 1b 2 trial of Onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI   bevacizumab in 2019  as second line therapy for patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer  mCRC  who have a Kras mutation  Tumor biomarkers drive therapy decisions for first line mCRC therapy and approximately 50  of mCRC is RAS mutant  KRAS   There is a large unmet need in RAS mutant mCRC as there are currently no targeted therapies available and second line treatments have only a 5  response rate  This is another cancer indication where Onvansertib has demonstrated synergy when combined with the current standard of care regimen However  it s important to remember that these are only three of what may prove to be a number of potential cancers and indications where Onvansertib  which you can think of as a  pipeline within a molecule  may have the potential to provide new and beneficial treatment options for patients The PLK1 enzyme  the enzyme that Onvansertib is designed to inhibit  is present in various breast cancers  lung cancers  lymphomas  leukemias  melanoma  and other cancer types  Should TROV demonstrate the benefit of Onvansertib in AML  metastatic prostate cancer and colorectal cancer  all difficult to treat cancers  treatment may also prove to be effective across a number of other cancers and indications The TakeawayThe takeaway here is a relatively simple one  TROV may be onto something with Onvansertib  a first in class  3rd generation  oral and highly selective Polo like Kinase 1  PLK1  inhibitor  While still early in their clinical development program  Onvansertib  as part of a combination regimen with already approved drugs  is showing clinical promise and appears to be safe and well tolerated in patients treated to date  TROV is working with leading investigators at premier institutions throughout the U S  We will be watching for more good news and exciting data from the ongoing clinical trials in the coming months This article was originally published at  ,2018-12-11,CNA

are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Mergers  Casualty Losses Drive U S  Insurers  4 PicksInsurance buyers have been facing extreme price pressure of late  Natural disasters  which ravaged parts of the United States in 2017 and 2018 so far  have not only resulted in increased number of insurance renewals but also higher premium pricing  What is rather a burden for buyers has proved to be a boon for insurance companies Also adding to the Insurance space s fortunes is an increasing number of mergers in the pipeline  In such circumstances where the industry is poised for growth  adding insurance stocks to one s portfolio seems prudent Insurance Renewals and Higher Prices a Boon Per the latest report published by Willis Towers Watson in its 2019 Insurance Marketplace Realities  players in the insurance industry are poised for tremendous growth in the days to come The report attributes the growth to increasing pricing pressure on insurance buyers due to a spate of casualty losses  Not only have prices increased in the recent past  cataclysmic events in 2017 and 2018 so far have resulted in a higher number of insurance renewals  Such events have led to firming up of the industry Experts from Willis Towers Watson also expect auto liability premiums to increase in 2019  the third year on the trot  Auto rates are believed to surge to anything between 6  and 12  in 2019 as the automobile sector experiences deteriorating cost of loss  Such costs result from ever increasing number of vehicles on the roads  which has bumped up auto claims Looking into the property market  the recent spate of natural disasters has resulted in increased prices of claims  For non catastrophe exposed programs  pricing is expected to increase 2 5   Pricing for catastrophe exposed programs are likely to surge between 2 5  and 7 5  in 2019  Also  catastrophe exposed programs for heavy losses could witness an increase in prices by as much as 10  Finally  an increasing aging population within the United States has resulted in higher number of claims from long term care and senior living facilities  The health insurance renewals are expected to increase between 5  and 30  Increased Number of Insurance Mergers in the PipelineMajor insurance players have shown an increased desire to pursue inorganic growth  Further  benefits such as newer technologies and talent of the incumbent workforce has resulted in an increase in number of mergers and acquisitions  M A  in the insurance industry According to a report published by PwC on Oct 24  2018  the total value of merger and acquisition activity in America s insurance sector increased to  8 1 billion in the third quarter of 2018  This was a steep increase from  1 9 billion in the same period in 2017 Of the various high profile mergers  the one that stands out is Apollo Global Management LLC s acquisition of Aspen Insurance Holdings Ltd  for  2 6 billion  The deal was announced in August 2018 and is yet to be completed  In the same month  the  2 2 billion takeover of Navigators Group Inc  by Hartford Financial Services Group  NYSE HIG  Inc  was also announced  It is yet to be completed 4 Hot ChoicesA series of natural disasters  an aging American population and increased number of vehicles on the roads have led to an increase in prices of insurance premiums  Further  a number of mergers in the

premiums  driven by its expanded multi product offering and competitive market rates Improvement in investment income as well as premiums has enabled the company to grow its revenues over an extended time frame and we expect this trend to continue  going forward Also  the company s efforts in boosting customer retention has led to improving policy life expectancy  PLE  over the past few years with the company anticipating to report higher PLE in the upcoming quarters  On the back of competitive pricing  the company strives to ensure that its consumer retention and innovative product offerings address clients  needs Further  a robust capital position has allowed the company to enhance shareholder value via dividend payouts  which includes special dividends as well as share buybacks  With respect to dividend payment  the P C insurer has registered a five year CAGR  2013 2018  of nearly 41   Hence  these shareholder friendly moves continue to raise optimism among investors In future  we expect Progressive to capitalize on cross selling auto policies and Progressive Home Advantage  PHA  to better its bundled strategy that will carve out the course for satisfying customers  need in

95696,317211,PGR,4 Best Value Bets From Undervalued P C Insurance Industry,opinion,The Zacks Property and Casualty industry is currently undervalued compared with the S P 500 index  The price to book  P B  ratio  the best multiple for valuing insurers because of their unpredictable financial results  is 1 4  less than the broader market s P B of 3 9  Such below market positioning hints at room for upside in the coming quarters Before the valuation expands  it is wise to add some undervalued stocks with growth potential to investors  portfolio for better returns Driving ForcesUnderwriting results  a P C insurer s profitability measure  are favored by a benign catastrophe environment  The ongoing year has endured a California mudslide in the first quarter followed by two severe wind and hailstorms witnessed in Texas and some parts of Southeastern states during April  A not so active cat environment coupled with price hikes should fuel underwriting profitability for insurers  Also  natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate Though P C insurers  financials are less sensitive to interest rates than life insurers   as the large financial portfolios managed by these carriers are designed to be fairly conservative  yet the improving interest rate environment will cushion to investment income  The interest rate has climbed up to 1 75  from its near zero level during the financial crisis  While a wave of optimism followed the Fed s last meeting hinting at a probable June hike  the regulatory body s indication of more such rate raises this year as well as the next should add more impetus to investment results The insurance industry is well capitalized  Its capital level is at an all time high  inspiring players to pursue mergers and acquisitions  thus curbing competition in the process The tax rate overhaul  calling for  1 5 trillion lower tax burden  slashed the rate to 21  from 35   Lower tax incidence widens scope for capital deployment as well as margin expansion An improving employment scenario raises optimism too  Per Bureau of Labor Statistics  unemployment rate in May was 3 8   lowest in 18 years   With the same declining  demand for

the longer term  predicted in its March 2018 FOMC meeting  However  4 5  unemployment rate over the long run still remains so  A spurt in employment shows an average of 0 2 million jobs growth over the last three months Encouraging economic data instills hopes  The Fed now estimates GDP to gain at 2 8  in 2018  up from the March forecast of 2 7   Expectations thereafter remain in line with the March projections of 2 4  in 2019  2  in 2020 and 1 8  over the long term   However  inflation might remain slightly above the targeted 2  through 2020  though the same will stay at 2  thereafter  Inflation is estimated at 2 1  till 2020 Although an improving rate environment comes as a piece of good news for some  while for others  it descends as bad news  Capital intensive industries worry as cost of capital rises  Meanwhile  banks and insurers remain major beneficiaries of a rising rate environment because of their sensitivity to interest rates With the progressing rate environment

95725,317240,PGR,5 Winning Stocks That Boast Solid Earnings Growth,opinion,Earnings growth interests all  right from the top brass to research analysts  And why not  If the company doesn t make money  it won t be able to stand the test of time  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  deduct production cost and you will have earnings This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock Earnings Estimates Determine Share PriceWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinion on factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm Investors  thus  should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Hence  it is important to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions  we have added the following parameters Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only Zacks Rank Buy and Strong Buy are allowed  With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there  this is a great way to start things off  5 Year Historical EPS

Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero  stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week    Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero  stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates being revised higher in the last 4 weeks  The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7 839 stocks to only 16  Here are the top five

95726,317241,PGR,Shrug Off Growing Inflationary Fears With 5 Financial Picks,opinion,The U S  stock markets have been reeling from severe volatility since February owing primarily to inflationary concerns  Investors remain apprehensive as inflationary tendencies are evident in multiple areas of economy  Market s expectations of a higher inflation have been fanned by massive tax cut  strong fundamentals of the U S  economy  robust labor market  higher consumer spending and geopolitical conflicts Notably  the markets are concerned that higher inflationary expectations will lead to the central bank raising the interest rate aggressively to stabilize the economy  However  a hike in interest rate will raise cost of funds which in turn will enable the financial sector to increase the spread between longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities  thus bolstering the sector s profits  Consequently  investment in financial stocks with favorable Zacks Rank is a lucrative option at the moment Strong Retails Sales DataOn May 11  the Commerce Department reported that U S  retail sales rose 0 3  for the month of April  at par with the consensus estimate  Retail sales are up for two straight months and also rose 4 7  year over year  Notably  nine out of a total of 13 industries witnessed an increase in sales in April  Investors fear that higher consumer spending may generate inflationary pressure prompting the central bank to pursue aggressive interest rate policy to cooldown the economy Geopolitical ConflictsOn May 17  the July Brent Crude  LCON8  touched  80 50  its highest level since November 2014  This was fueled by the concerns regarding the United States re imposition of sections on Iran which will limit the oil production of Iran and elevate the oil prices  Although the higher oil prices may spur capital spending by oil producers  it is likely to take a toll on consumers  However  elevated capital spending may result in higher wage rate Robust Labor MarketThe unemployment rate declined from 4 1  in March to 3 9  in April  the lowest level in nearly 18 years  This is the first time in six months that the unemployment rate has undergone a decline  Healthy non farm payrolls data for April along with continuing decline in the weekly jobless claims is a clear indication of the employers  intentions to continue recruiting  This may result into wage growth generating inflationary tendencies Our Top PicksStrong earnings  massive tax cuts and solid economic data are likely to boost consumer spending in the coming months driving the price level up  This may prompt the Fed to aggressively implement tight monetary policy  Higher interest rate will eventually aid the banking industry  Non banking financial institutions  including insurance companies  asset managers and brokerage firms  should also gain We narrowed down our choice to five banking stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and solid growth potential  You

95727,317242,PGR,AXIS Capital s Top Line Growth Impresses  Rising Costs A Woe,opinion,AXIS Capital Holdings Limited   NYSE AXS   has earned goodwill in the market  building a robust product and service portfolio  which includes primary and excess products as well as property and casualty  P C  treaty reinsurance  Its stellar record vouches for its successful servicing of the clients by catering to their diverse needs  Historically  the clients have gained a lot from the company s bouquet of diverse insurance products and services and by retaining this bullish sentiment among investors  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  P C insurer continues to evolve stronger over time and looks set to retain its purple patch in the near future Growth DriversAXIS Capital has been witnessing premium growth over a considerable period of time  driven by new business opportunities across the company s business lines as well as its astute acquisitions  We expect the P C insurer to continue capitalizing on such prospects and strategic initiatives going forward  which might result in improved premiums Apart from helping AXIS Capital to ramp up its premium growth profile  the buyout of Novae Group plc in 2017 is projected to be financially accretive to the company with targeted cost savings of at least  30  35 million in 2018 while estimating  60 million by 2020 Given the improvement in investment income as well as premiums  the company has displayed top line growth and we anticipate this momentum to continue in the near term  The company remains focused on strengthening casualty and professional lines in the insurance segment  motor and reinsurance in particular Over the past five years  AXIS Capital has returned to shareholders in excess of 100  of aggregate operating income through dividends and share repurchases  Notably  the 2 6  hike in dividend in the first quarter of 2018 marked the 13th straight dividend increase  We hope that a sustained operational efficiency will allow the company to engage in shareholder friendly moves in the future  thereby raising optimism among investors  Going forward  the company intends to pay back at least 200  of its six months operating earnings to investors Growth Projections  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings per share is pegged at  4 52  representing a year over year surge of 243 5    For 2019  the consensus estimate for earnings per share stands at  5  reflecting a year over year increase of 10 5  AXIS Capital has expected long term earnings per share growth of 8 5  An Outperformer  Shares of AXIS Capital have rallied 15  year to date  outperforming the  s 1 1  decrease  We believe  the company s sustained operational performance  strategic initiatives  premium growth and a solid capital position will drive the stock higher in the near term   Positive Earnings Surprise History  AXIS Capital displays an encouraging earnings surprise history  having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 5 11  Attractive Valuation  Looking at the company s price to book ratio   the best multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next   shares are undervalued at the current level  The company has a trailing 12 month P B ratio of 1 07  falling below the industry average of 1 41 Near Term HeadwindsBeing a P C insurer  the company has been suffering catastrophe loss for a considerable period of time  thereby hampering the company s underwriting profitability with the combined ratio having deteriorated in the last few years Also  escalating expenses  mainly due to higher net losses and loss expenses  general and administrative expenses as well as higher acquisition costs persist to limit the operating margin expansion  Moreover  the company does not expect a turnaround on this front anytime soon Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Alleghany Corporation   NYSE Y    The Progressive Corporation   NYSE PGR   and RLI Corp    NYSE RLI    each sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

Corporation   NYSE PGR   Bet on These Stocks with Remarkable Net Profit MarginsNet profit  also referred to as the bottom line  is one of the key tools that gauges the financial health of an enterprise  The figure demonstrates a company s ability to convert per dollar sales into profits A low profit margin indicates higher risks  implying that a drop in revenues might dent profits  pushing the company into the red  net loss  Net Profit Margin   Net profit Sales  100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers lends the company a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective to analyze a company s

Nevertheless  Altria has been progressing well with expansion in the smokeless products category  This fueled its smokeless product revenue in fourth quarter 2017  wherein earnings kept its stellar year over year growth trend intact  Results were backed by solid pricing  higher OCI and lower tax rates

The Zacks Rank system harnesses the power of earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find companies that are on track to outpace the market over the next one to three months  Only about 5  of stocks tracked by Zacks earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   so investors can rest assured that these are the strongest options available 
In the story below  you will learn about one particular company that helped illustrate the strength of the Zacks Rank  If investors had followed this model when it flagged this insurance behemoth  they would have witnessed massive gains 
The Progressive Corporation  NYSE PGR   PGR 
Progressive provides personal and commercial property casualty insurance  and other specialty property casualty insurance and related services primarily in the United States  The stock has reached the  1  Strong Buy  designation several times over the past year  with enormous success following shortly thereafter 
For instance  Progressive was given a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  on April 14  2017  The company s earnings outlook was likely improving ahead of its report date just four days later  In that report  Progressive would post earnings growth of 59 5   total revenues came in at  6 27 billion  up 13 2  year over year and ahead of our consensus estimate of  6 15 billion 
PGR would surge 9 6  and never dipped below a  3  Hold  before being added to the Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  list again on June 30  This time around  the stock spent three weeks in the top spot and would pick up even more steam  Shares eventually surged as much as 26 3  before PGR reached its third  1  Strong Buy  on Jan  5 
This third designation also came shortly before Progressive reported its latest quarterly financial results  Just a few weeks later  the company would post adjusted earnings of 79 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents and improving 27 4  from the year ago period  Quarterly revenues totaled  7 13 billion  marking growth of 18 8  
The below chart demonstrates the price performance for PGR and 12 month forward looking EPS estimate  in red   starting from the time the stock first earned a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
 
As we can see  PGR has been a huge winner for those that followed the Zacks Rank  The stock is currently up about 55 9  since earning a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  last year  Investors should know that our model is the simplest way to identify elite stocks poised to beat the market on a consistent basis

95831,317346,PGR,Travelers Or Progressive  Which Is Better Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Riding high on an improving economic backdrop  increasing interest rates and a benign catastrophe environment  the insurance industry seems well placed to facilitate players in ramping up their growth profile Recently  the Fed has raised the interest rate by 25 basis points under the new chairman Jerome Powell and the rate now stands at 1 75   The Federal Reserve has hinted at two more hikes in 2018 followed by three in 2019 and two in 2020  thus pushing up the rate to 3 4  An increased rate is expected to positively impact the net investment income  a major component of an insurer s top line  A broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes are other upsides Underwriting results   the major indicator of profitability for any insurer   are expected to improve on the back of a favorable catastrophe setting  Though  the first quarter escaped the wrath of Mother Nature  there were a few cat events like California mudslide and northeast winter storms  Chubb Limited   NYSE CB   has estimated  305 million of cat loss for the first quarter of 2018 Nonetheless  price increases by insurers will help generating improved premiums Also  President Donald Trump s tax reform policy  an overhaul of tax code after 31 years  lowers the corporate tax burden  The tax rate was slashed to 21  from 35   calling for a  1 5 trillion tax cut Interestingly  due to lower tax incidence  net profit available to shareholders will be higher  thereby leaving room for higher dividend payout by the companies The Property and Casualty Insurance industry is ranked at  200  denoting the bottom half of the  for 265 plus industries  However  the industry s registered rise of 1 3  has outperformed the S P 500 index s loss of 0 8  year to date  Here we focus on two property and casualty insurers  namely The Travelers Companies  Inc    NYSE TRV   and The Progressive Corporation   NYSE PGR    While the former with a market capitalization of  37 88 billion provides commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance products and services in the United states and internationally  the latter provides personal and commercial auto insurance  residential property insurance as well as other specialty property casualty insurance and related services  primarily in the United States with a market cap of  35 7 billion A better ranked stock from the same industry is CNA Financial Corporation   NYSE CNA    sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Zacks RankTravelers carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  while Progressive has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Travelers emerges a clear winner in this round Price PerformanceShares of Progressive have soared 55 9   outperforming both Travelers  rally of 15 9  and the  s increase of 17 2  in a year  The Progressive stock undoubtedly performs better with this metric 
 ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple used for valuing insurers because of its variations in quarterly earnings  The industry s P B ratio is 1 43  However  both Progressive and Travelers with a reading of 3 84 and 1 59  respectively  are overvalued compared with the industry s tally  Yet with a comparatively lower P B ratio  Traveler s shares are cheaply priced and hence the stock wins this round 
  Debt to EquityTravelers has a lower debt to equity ratio of 27 6 compared with the industry average of 29 1  and Progressive s leverage ratio of 35 6   Therefore Travelers has a visible edge over Progressive here 
  Return on EquityProgressive with a return on equity of nearly 16  exceeded the industry average of 4 8  as well as Travelers s reading of 8 6   Return on equity is a profitability measure  identifying how the company is effectively utilizing its shareholders  money  Hence Progressive wins hands down this time  Dividend YieldBoth Travelers and Progressive underperform the industry s dividend yield of 6 73   Yet with 2 07  yield  Travelers scores higher than Progressive s yield of 1 84   Combined RatioCombined ratio  the percentage of premiums paid out as claims and expenses  determines an insurer s underwriting profitability Progressive s combined ratio was 93 4 in 2017 while Travelers s is 97 9  Thus Progressive edges past Travelers with this parameter Earnings ESPBoth companies are set to report their earnings in the latter half of this month  Per our proven model  Travelers is set to deliver a positive surprise with the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank of 2 and an  of  2 00   While Progressive s Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes prediction inconclusive although it has a favorable Zack Rank of 3 Earnings Surprise HistoryAs far as the companies  surprise history goes  Travelers earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 43 06  Progressive s metric too has outpaced the consensus mark in the last two quarters with an average four quarter surprise of 5 01  Travelers visibly beats Progressive in this round of the comparison game Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth Projections    Progressive s 2018 earnings estimates have moved 5 1  north in the last 30 days  While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has been revised 2 6  upward  The consensus mark for 2018 reflects 40 7  growth on 17 5  revenue increase  For 2019  the bottom line is expected to rise 5 2  on 12  higher revenues  The projected long term earnings growth is pegged at 7 3  For Travelers  the consensus mark for 2018 earnings has been raised 0 3  in the last 30 days while the same for 2019 has been revised upward only by a cent  The  consensus estimate for 2018 reflects 45 9  surge on 2 6  revenue improvement  For 2019  the bottom line is likely to increase 6 2  on 3 9  higher top line  The anticipated long term earnings growth stands at 7 5  This round lends equal weightage to both competitors To ConcludeTravelers scored higher than Progressive on the basis of a solid Zacks Rank  valuation  sturdy leverage ratio  strong dividend yield and a robust earnings surprise history  However  considering yardsticks like price performance  return on equity or a combined ratio  Progressive seems better equipped than Travelers  Per our comparative analysis  Travelers is thus  a more economically feasible investment option for investors than Progressive Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ",2018-04-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/travelers-or-progressive-which-is-better-ahead-of-earnings-200303704,200303704

point to  further gradual increases  in short term interest rate  Many market participants believe that the addition of the word  further  opens the door to four hikes  According to data compiled by CME Group  NASDAQ CME   there is 30  probability that the Fed will raise rates four times this year  compared with about 20  a month ago In particular  the combination of tax cuts and spending increases would result in higher inflation  compelling Fed to tighten its policy aggressively  Notably  the first rate hike for this year is expected to come as soon as next month The hawkish signals

2 60 per share  The bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 82 by 7 8  and slightly slipped 1 1  from the year ago quarter Reinsurance Group of America  Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     The company s weak performance at Traditional business in the Asia Pacific and U S  and Latin America regions in the reported quarter was primarily responsible for this downside Nonetheless  highlights of the quarter under review are the strong performance at both EMEA and Canada segments  driven primarily by a favorable individual mortality experience Reinsurance Group s operating revenues of  3 2 billion improved 4 7  year over year  However  the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 7  Net premiums of  2 5 billion inched up 0 5  year over year  Investment income rose 13 6  from the prior year quarter to  564 8 million  The average investment yield was down 31 basis points  bps  to 4 38   representing lower yields on new money and reinvested assets plus lower variable investment income Total benefits and expenses at Reinsurance Group increased 7 3  year over year to  2 9 billion  Higher claims and other policy benefits  interest credited  policy acquisition costs  other operating expenses as well as collateral finance and securitization expenses resulted in the overall escalation in costs Full Year HighlightsFor 2017  Reinsurance Group reported adjusted operating earnings per share of  10 84  falling short of the consensus mark by 2 1  but improving 11 4  year over year Total revenues of  12 3 billion rose 8 1  year over year Quarterly Segment UpdateU S  and Latin America  Total pre tax income declined nearly 11  to  194 3 million in the quarter under discussion The Traditional segment reported pre tax adjusted operating income  which plunged 27 5  to  93 8 million year over year  The downside was attributable to modestly unfavorable claims experience in the Individual Mortality segment and a weak performance in Group  Net premiums fell 3  from the year ago quarter to  1 4 billion due to the negotiated modification of an existing health treaty that effectively reduced premiums in the quarter The Asset Intensive segment s pre tax adjusted operating income improved 18 4  to  55 3 million  Additional income from a new in force transaction  written earlier in 2018 along with the impact from favorable equity markets  contributed to the upside  Financial Reinsurance business reported pre tax adjusted operating income of  21 1 million compared with  14 4 million in the prior year quarter owing to strong businesses volumes Canada  Total pre tax operating income rose 10 2  to  42 7 million The Traditional segment s pre tax adjusted operating income improved 10 9  to  38 6 million  driven by favorable individual mortality experience  Net premiums slid 1 2  at  239 million  This decline is attributable to the persistent effects of a previously disclosed reduction in creditor business treaty The Financial Solutions segment s pre tax adjusted operating income rose 2 4  year over year to  4 2 million on favorable longevity   Total pre tax adjusted operating income was  27 9 million  skyrocketing 126 3  from the prior year quarter Pre tax adjusted operating income of the traditional segment surged 47  to  27 2 million during the quarter  Premiums improved 11  to  495 4 million on

Traditional segment reported pre tax operating income of about  29 7 million  up nearly 88  from the prior year quarter  This upside was attributable to favorable mortality and morbidity experience  primarily in the U K  Premiums  which improved 7  to  321 9 million  mainly owing to new business across the segment and growth of existing treaties The Financial Solutions segment s pre tax adjusted operating income declined 6  to  34 5 million Corporate and Other  Pre tax adjusted operating loss of  59 6 million was wider than the loss of  26 3 million incurred in the prior year period Financial

revenues  This is an improvement from the preceding quarter s performance as the third quarter was impacted by soft performance from the insurance industry due to a series of hurricanes that was devastating   A Silver Lining in the CloudHowever  the fourth quarter was not as badly affected as the third quarter  Though the period is estimated to suffer due to California wildfires  the magnitude is softer than that of Hurricane Harvey  which wreaked havoc last August  followed by Irma and Maria as well as the Mexican earthquakes  Per a report released by The California Department of Insurance  insurance claims have crossed  9 4 billion while catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimated that the loss could be about  10 5 billion Nonetheless  insurers  having already suffered the bruise in the third quarter are likely to have weathered the fourth quarter cat loss too  Nevertheless  underwriting profitability must have suffered due to the Californian wildfires Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in the underwriting results  insurers have braced themselves with prudent underwriting practices to withstand the loss to some extent Also  insurers

The Fed kept its promise for three rate hikes in 2017  Since December 2016  four rate hikes have been made and the interest rate now stands at 1 25 1 50   Also  the outgoing Fed chairperson Janet Yellen reiterated the expectation to raise rates thrice in 2018 and twice in 2019  Owing to a gradually improving rate environment  investment results have also markedly improved from the historical

As per   Harvey has thumped a quarter of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and over  of U S  refining capacity  The area is a major hub for oil refineries  Several energy companies have shut down their operations  The last major storm that lashed this region in 2008 was Hurricane Ike  which cost the refining industry roughly  
This sparked off concerns about oversupply situation in the U S   from refineries is likely to pressure crude oil prices and ETFs like United States Oil Fund  NYSE USO  LP   Oil exploration ETF like The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund  this may lose ahead due to lack of activity 
However  demand for finished product  should rise  Gasoline futures on Monday jumped to a  high level  which should benefit United States Gasoline Fund    The difference in the price of crude oil for October delivery and Nymex gasoline futures for September   the  crack spread    doubled to about  24 on Friday  as per an article published on CNBC  This should benefit VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF   read    
Insurance 
Severe destruction is likely after Harvey s passage as flooding in Texas may be identical to that of 2005 s Hurricane Katrina     the costliest natural disaster in U S  history  said an  group   Insurance stocks normally fall over 1  in the month following the disaster caused by a  and severe flooding 
John Dickson  president of NFS Edge Insurance Agency  estimates about 15  of the Houston area to be insured for flood  As a result  property and casualty insurance companies may be hit hard as these are likely to shell out handsomely on claims in such catastrophic storms 
Insurance companies like Chubb Limited   NYSE CB    The Allstate Corporation   NYSE ALL    Prudential Financial Inc    NYSE PRU   and Progressive Corp    NYSE PGR   are likely to be hurt  The insurance ETF iShares Dow Jones US Insurance Fund  will feel the brunt  see  here  
Agriculture 
As per Bloomberg the rain is washing away the largest U S  cotton producer  drenching extra supplies stored on fields by many Texas farmers  Ports like Galveston will remain closed till Harvey dies out 
The Bloomberg article went on to point out that ports at the Texas Gulf make up about 24  of U S  wheat exports  3  of corn shipments and 2  of soybeans  Naturally  this pseudo supply crisis will likely push up crop prices  benefiting ETFs like iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN   Teucrium Wheat Fund   Teucrium Corn ETF  and Teucrium Soybean ETF   In fact  in such a heavy downpour  livestock is also at risk  which may push up iPath Pure Beta Livestock ETN   read    
Transportation 
Rail transportation near Houston has been delayed and massive gridlock on highways is expected  As many as 1 847 flights were canceled on Sunday at airports in Houston  Corpus Christi  San Antonio  Austin and Dallas  and an additional 1 580 were called off for Monday  according to  and quoted on Bloomberg  Naturally  transportation ETFs like SPDR S P Transportation  NYSE XTN  ETF  and U S  Global Jets ETF   KL JETS   may feel the pressure ahead  read

96084,317599,PGR,Insurers Can Stay Calm While Harvey Wreaks Havoc  4 Picks,opinion,The untold damage and misery caused by Hurricane Harvey is not just being felt by the residents of Texas  Markets were also singed by the tropical cyclone on Monday  with energy and financials bearing the brunt of the pain  Stocks of energy companies suffered after key refineries in Texas had to close due to widespread flooding  But losses for insurers were possibly the most alarming  with the iShares U S  Insurance ETF losing 1  This was possibly a reaction to the enormous level of claims likely to be generated in the aftermath of this disaster  However  industry watchers think that the industry has the ability to absorb resulting losses and may even gain in the months ahead via higher rates  Adding select property and casualty insurers to your portfolio makes for a prudent option at this point Insurers Possess Sufficient Capital Market watchers believe that insurers and reinsurers possess sufficient capital reserves to withstand the losses incurred by Hurricane Harvey  The damage generated by this Category 4 storm is yet to be correctly estimated  However  it is the fiercest hurricane to impact Texas since 2008  Even now  continuous rainfall is flooding the affected areas of the state  Current projections are that the hurricane may cost the U S  nearly  30 billion However  insurers serving individuals and businesses currently sport appreciably high levels of capital  Additionally  they do not require such funds to back existing obligations  Given such a state of affairs  Hurricane Harvey is unlikely to dent insurers  financial position  At most  insurers with business concentrated in the storm affected areas would experience a fall in quarterly earnings Gains Likely in Months AheadIn 2005  insurers had suffered losses in the immediate fallout of Hurricane Katrina  Yet  over the next three months  industry heavyweights such as Chubb Limited   NYSE CB    The Progressive Corporation   NYSE PGR   and The Allstate Corporation   NYSE ALL   notched up heavy gains  While Progressive and Allstate shares increased 20  and 10   respectively  shares of Chubb skyrocketed over this period  gaining 27  A similar scenario is likely to develop this time around as well  First  analysts think that the federal government s National Flood Insurance Program will have to bear the lion s share of losses incurred by Hurricane Harvey  Second  insurers will once again be able to raise rates in the aftermath of a storm of such ferocity  Reinsurers will also likely benefit since over the medium term they will gain the ability to increase their insurance rates  In the aftermath of Katrina  the likes of Marsh   McLennan Companies  Inc    NYSE MMC    which is an insurance broker  notched up gains in keeping with insurers Our ChoicesDespite initial losses  insurers should withstand the impact of Hurricane Harvey without much difficulty  Appreciably high capital reserves provide them sufficient cushion for such an eventuality Further  they could actually move higher in the months ahead as they begin to raise rates  Investing in property and casualty insurers looks like a smart option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score First American Financial Corporation

96085,317600,PGR,Insurance Companies Taking A Hit From Hurricane Harvey ,opinion,"Unless you have been living under a rock  you know that Hurricane Harvey is causing unprecedented damage to Southeastern Texas  primarily the city of Houston  The main issue is flooding rains which by the end of the storm could stand at over 40 inches  Some reports estimate that  on the Texas coast  Adding the costs of repairs to interior Texas and this storm will easily be one of the most expensive ever 
How does this affect the ordinary investor  There are many ways  but the largest is insurance companies  There is no doubt there will be millions of claims from auto owners  homeowners and businesses  looking to get money for the repairs needed 
Today s post is going to look at the biggest insurance companies in the area and see the impact the storm will have on their business going forward  It will also highlight some stocks that could stand to profit 
Insurance Companies In The Path Of The Storm
There are a handful of insurers in the area that will be affected by the hurricane  On the commercial side of things  here are the largest insurers based on market share in the state of Texas 
Hartford Financial Services Group  NYSE HIG 
The Travelers Companies Inc  NYSE TRV 
Nationwide  privately held 
Zurich Insurance Group Ltd  OTC ZURVY 
Chubb  NYSE CB 
On the homeowners and automobile side of things  the following insurers have a large market share in the area 
Allstate Corporation  NYSE ALL 
Progressive Corporation  NYSE PGR 
The Travelers Companies Inc  NYSE TRV 
How This Will Impact Investors
Shares of these companies already took a hit from traders  realizing the damage and the cost to pay out claims  But going forward  it s not all good news for these insurers 
In the short term  you will have the companies miss estimates and try to recover lost premiums by raising premiums on insured throughout the country  They will also face the potential of lawsuits that could drag out for years 
All told  the rest of the year will be a volatile one for insurance stocks as they will react to both good and bad news as it relates to Hurricane Harvey 
So What Should Investors Do 
In my opinion  if you aren t a fan of volatility  then stay away from these stocks  Of course  you could take a contrarian view  Most of the damage is a result of flooding and most homeowner polices don t include flood coverage  It is a separate insurance you need to purchase 
So insurance companies might not be as bad off  Regardless however  volatility will still be the norm for the short term with these stocks 
Instead focus on the longer term  Houston is the 4th largest city in the United States  so many homes will need to be rebuilt 
This bodes well for Home Depot  NYSE HD  and Lowe s Companies Inc  NYSE LOW   Additionally  with many cars flooded out  consumers will be in the market for a replacement vehicle  While not all will buy a new car  many will 
And Texas is a place where trucks are king  So shares of General Motors  NYSE GM  and Ford Motor Company  NYSE F   the two big players in the industry could benefit 
Final Thoughts
At the end of the day  investors will want to steer clear from insurance stocks that do business in this region for the short term  Once things settle down  then investors can come back in  Of course  if you are OK with volatility over the short term  then snatching up some of these stocks on the cheap isn t a bad idea 
But for other investors  looking at the recovery and rebuilding process is where there will be a lot of money  And if you can get in on these stocks now  you should see a nice return on your investment

96086,317601,PGR,Insurance Stocks To Endure The Wrath Of Hurricane Harvey,opinion,"e massive trail of destruction in Houston and Texas Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Harvey has left insurers feeling jittery in the fear of high claim costs  While its too early to estimate the loss incurred due to the calamity  one of JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  analyst s anticipates potential losses to range anywhere from  10  20 billion Harvey  which went from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane  is expected to be among the top 10 financially damaging catastrophes ever to strike the United States Is There a Silver Lining to the Cloud On the face of it  catastrophe losses cause a spike in loss ratio and hurt insurer s underwriting margins  However  these losses act as catalysts in turning the industry s pricing cycle  Notably  insurance industry is highly cyclical in nature  and is characterized by periods of soft and hard pricing phases Major events like Harvey are required by the industry now to turn the pricing cycle  A benign cat loss environment in the recent years fattened the capital reserves of the insurers resulting in the loosening of underwriting standards as insurers equipped with huge cash did not mind undertaking risky businesses at low prices  This heightened competition and insurers were compelled to lower prices further to attract more business  Eventually  pricing woes crept up  as evident by the continued soft pricing in many insurance business lines Though the industry suffered a cat loss of  21 6 billion in 2016  it was only a modest increase compared with the 10 year average of  19 1 billion A recent report by Swiss Re states that global insured losses from disasters plunged to  23 billion in the first half of 2017 from  36 billion in the year ago period Lower levels of claims from natural catastrophes and other disasters suppressed demand for insurance against such events  consequently putting pressure on premiums Further  a report from insurance broker Marsh stated that global insurance rates fell for the 17th consecutive quarter  with property insurance rates down 2 8  In a recent fact release  the Information Insurance Institute stated that the private insurance industry will easily able to handle losses from Harvey As of Mar 31  2017  the U S  property casualty industry has  709 billion of capital  a cushion that is more than adequate to deal with events like the one mentioned above Nevertheless  the  has outperformed the broader market in last two years  evident from a return of 32  compared with the S P 500 s gain of 24   Insurance Stocks in FocusCompanies such as Allstate Corp    NYSE ALL    Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa    and Progressive Corp    NYSE PGR   have a significant presence in the region with market share of nearly 13   11  and 9   respectively  Other companies with presence in Texas are MeLife Inc    NYSE MET    Kemper Corp   Chubb  NYSE CB  Ltd  among others  However  these companies have considerably lower market share in the region Shares of both Progressive and Berkshire Hathaway fell by 2 3   while Allstate and Travellers declined 1 5  and 2 6   respectively  on Aug 28  the first trading session after Harvey struck on the night of Aug 25 Nevertheless  some of the stocks gained the following trading day on the likelihood of benefiting from raised premiums due to the devastation caused by Harvey ConclusionIt remains to be seen weather related losses over the coming months can shrink the massive capital surplus and change the insurance pricing cycle of the industry

Agrium   AGU  made a Tweezers Top in January and then started to move lower  It found a bottom in May in the middle of a broad consolidation that did not end until July  A fast move higher then and a pause led to retracement to the 200 day SMA and then a bounce  Now it is back at prior resistance  The RSI is moving up into the bullish zone while the MACD is crossed up  positive and rising  Look for a push over resistance to participate higher   
DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc  NYSE DVA

Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which saw the joy in the equity markets that was there when the week started fade to just a subtle fist pump at the end of the holiday shortened week 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its uptrend while Crude Oil pulls back in its move higher  The US Dollar Index continues to melt down while US Treasuries are biased to the upside  The Shanghai Composite is pausing in its break out and Emerging Markets are biased also consolidating at long term resistance in their uptrend 
Volatility looks to remain low keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts show some short term retrenchment as they hit highs  while the long term rising trend remains unperturbed  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Use Relative Price Strength to Find These Winning Stocks 

	Investors generally gauge a stock s potential return by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark 

	If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns 

	Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy 

	Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains

96222,317737,PGR,Allstate Vs  Chubb  Which Stock Scores Ahead Of Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"The curtain has already been raised for the second quarter earnings season with banks started reporting their quarterly results  The insurance industry is all set to announce its results shortly   Underwriting results  the major indicator of profitability of any insurer  is likely to be affected  This is due to 16 severe wind and hail catastrophe events which occurred in April and May  The catastrophe losses not only have deteriorated the combined ratio but have also been a drag on the bottom line The insurance industry has been building its capital reserve  courtesy a benign catastrophe environment  We expect some prudent underwriting standards to guard the insurers from erosion of the same The interest rate environment has been slowly improving with Fed  Federal Reserve  raising interest rate thrice in three consecutive quarters  This reflects Fed s confidence in the improving U S  economy  An increased rate positively impacts the net investment income  a major component of an insurer s top line  A broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes are other positives Though the  industry is currently ranked at  229  lies in the bottom one third of the Zacks Industry Rank for the 252  industries   it has outperformed the S P 500 in the last one year period by registering a gain of 15 64   The index  on the other hand  climbed 13 36  
In this scenario  we focus on two leading property and casualty insurers ahead of the earnings release by the insurers  The Allstate Corporation   NYSE ALL   is the second largest property casualty  P C  insurer and the largest publicly held personal lines carrier in the U S   while  Chubb Limited   NYSE CB   is one of the world s largest providers of property and casualty  P C  insurance and reinsurance and the largest publicly traded P C insurer  While Allstate has a market capitalization of  32 46 billion  Chubb has a market capitalization of  67 79 billion Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals Some better ranked stocks from the same industry are Progressive Corp   NYSE PGR    flaunting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and Everest Re Group Ltd    NYSE RE    carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Price PerformanceAllstate has outpaced the industry with its shares rallying 28 44   whereas Chubb has underperformed the industry with merely 12 29  gain  Allstate emerges a clear winner in this round

ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple  used for valuing insurers  Compared with Property and Casualty Industry s P B ratio of 1 44  Allstate is over priced with a reading of 1 67  Meanwhile  Chubb is much cheaper with a trailing 12 month P B multiple of 1 38  This round goes to Chubb as Chubb s shares are cheaper than Allstate s 
Debt to EquityBoth Allstate and Chubb have lower debt to equity versus the industry average of 32 14   Chubb with a leverage ratio of 28 45 has an edge over Allstate with the leverage ratio of 29 99 

Dividend YieldIn the last one year period  Allstate s dividend yield was 1 96   while Chubb s was 1 66    Both have a dividend yield that outpaces the industry s average of 0 50    On a comparative basis  Allstate has an edge over Chubb 

Earnings Surprise HistoryWith respect to the companies  surprise history  Allstate has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average beat 27 77   Chubb on the other hand delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with a four quarter average beat of 5 56  Again Allstate has an edge over ChubbEarnings Estimate Revisions and Growth ProjectionsNotably for both companies  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved south for 2017 but rallied for 2018 Allstate 2017 estimates have moved down 0 64  but have increased 1 2  for 2018 in the last 60 days   Chubb s 2017 estimates on the other hand have moved down 0 48  but have improved by a cent for 2018 in the last 60 days For Chubb  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is  10 30 for 2017  reflecting year over year growth of 1 78   For 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  10 68  representing year over year growth of 3 65   Chubb has long term expected earnings per share growth of 10 0  For Allstate  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is  6 20 for 2017  reflecting year over year growth of 27 24   For 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  6 96  representing year over year growth of 12 24   Chubb has long term expected earnings per share growth of 8 0  Allstate has once more edged over Chubb in respect of growth projections Earnings ESPPer the proven model  Chubb is likely to beat on earnings this time because it has the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank as well as an  of  0 40 However  our model does not conclusively show that Allstate is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  While a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  an Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes prediction difficult Chubb is a clear winner here To ConcludeAllstate holds an edge over Chubb on price performance  dividend yield  earnings surprise history and growth projections  While considering parameters like valuation  leverage and an Earnings ESP  Chubb seems better than Allstate  Based on our comparative analysis  Allstate presently has an edge over Chubb

96390,317905,PGR,Progressive Corporation  PGR   The Perfect Mix Of Value And Rising Earnings Estimates ,opinion,Value investing is always a very popular strategy  and for good reason  After all  who doesn t want to find stocks that have low PEs  solid outlooks  and decent dividends Fortunately for investors looking for this combination  we have identified a strong candidate which may be an impressive value  The Progressive Corporation   NYSE PGR   Progressive Corporation in FocusPGR may be an interesting play thanks to its forward PE of 17 6  its P S ratio of 0 98  and its decent dividend yield of 1 7   These factors suggest that Progressive Corporation is a pretty good value pick  as investors have to pay a relatively low level for each dollar of earnings  and that PGR has decent revenue metrics to back up its earnings Progressive Corporation  The  PE Ratio  TTM     But before you think that Progressive Corporation is just a pure value play  it is important to note that it has been seeing solid activity on the earnings estimate front as well  For current year earnings  the consensus has gone up by 8 2  in the past 60 days  thanks to 9 upward revisions in the past two months compared to none lower This estimate strength is actually enough to push PGR to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   suggesting it is poised to outperform  You can see  So really  Progressive Corporation is looking great from a number of angles thanks to its PE below 20  a P S ratio below one  and a strong Zacks Rank  meaning that this company could be a great choice for value investors at this time Zacks  Best Private Investment Ideas                                                                                                                                                                          While we are happy to share many articles like this on the website  our best recommendations and most in depth research are not available to the public                                                                                                                                                                Starting today  for the next month  you can follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time  Our experts cover all kinds of trades  from value to momentum       from stocks under  10 to ETF and option moves       from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  You can even look inside exclusive portfolios that are normally closed to new investors ,2017-04-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/progressive-corporation-(pgr):-the-perfect-mix-of-value-and-rising-earnings-estimates-200182560,200182560
96391,317906,PGR,Too Nervous To Rise ,opinion,"The market is just a bundle of nerves right now  and seems more than willing to limp out of this short week and get to the three day weekend  Stocks spent the session in the red again and showed little desire to reverse course  The S P finished lower by 0 38  to 2344 9  the Dow was off 0 29  to 20 591 9 and the NASDAQ slipped 0 52  to 5836 2 
D C  is unlikely to give the market what it wants  tax reform  anytime soon  and now we have to worry about global tensions with Russia Syria and North Korea  So the best chance we have to break out of this malaise is earnings season  which has its first big day tomorrow with some of the major banks  JP Morgan  Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   Citigroup  NYSE C  and PNC Financial  NYSE PNC   among others   If we can get a good earnings season with no further military action  then perhaps the market can calm down a bit and end this pause in the bull run 
We did get a lot more action in the portfolios today than on Tuesday  The earnings season is the busiest time for Surprise Trader  and today it started off with a play in the insurance market  Meanwhile  Zacks Counterstrike and ETF Investor each sold a position for double digit profits and replaced them with new buys  Learn all about it in the highlights section below Today s Portfolio Highlights 
Surprise Trader  It s earnings season again  so things are about to pick up for this portfolio  Eric kicked things off today with a 12 5  position in Progressive Corporation  NYSE PGR   which is a play in the insurance market  The stock was just upgraded to a Zacks Rank  1 as all recent estimate revisions have been to the upside with solid magnitude  Plus  it enjoys a positive Earnings ESP of just under 3  for its upcoming report  Add it all up  and the editor believes this is a potential winner moving forward  The full write up has more on this new addition Zacks Counterstrike  The VIX continues to move higher  which was the reason Jeremy bought ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  a few days ago  The editor thinks this is a good time to sell half of the position for a gain of 25 8  and plans to hold onto the other half until the S P moves to 2370 
Meanwhile  Applied Optoelectronics  AAOI  has plunged more than 30  over the last couple of weeks for no reason  This Zacks Rank  1 has fallen right into Jeremy s buy zone  so he added a small 5  position today  The company had a strong quarter in February and is nearing its next report on May 8th  The editor took a position today before investors  come to their senses and buy the stock back up   Read the complete commentary for more on these moves  UPDATE  AAOI beat and guided higher after the bell  sending shares upward by more than 17  after hours ETF Investor  The portfolio sold WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity ETF  DXJ  on Wednesday as part of a swap  since this hedged fund has been rather rough lately  However  it still generated a nice 17 2  return  On the other end  Eric added a position in iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility EAFE  EFAV   which has a broader global focus and doesn t use a currency hedge  Basically  this fund s low volatility focus should help it weather the current sluggish environment  The editor will provide a full rationale for these moves in tomorrow s weekly commentary Reitmeister Trading Alert   Tuesday represented the second test of the 50 day moving average with stocks bouncing back above by the close  Unfortunately the third time was not the charm on Wednesday as stocks did break below and close below this key support level at 2351 
 Perhaps stocks bounce back above on Thursday to thwart the downside momentum  But if that does not happen  then I would expect a test of the 100 day moving average at 2300  This is also an important psychological level that should provide some stiff backbone  But if that fails  then perhaps it is finally time to test the long term trend line  200 day moving average  at 2227 
 Again  this is only a call to arms for active short term traders who want to time some of the markets bigger moves  Long term investors can continue to rest easy as this has nothing to do with the bull market losing its grip  Just some of the short term shock waves of a market that was finally due for some downward pressure      Steve ReitmeisterOne More Thing

96440,317955,PGR,The HartFord  HIG  Q3 Earnings Beat On Higher Revenues,opinion,"The Hartford Financial Services Group  Inc    NYSE HIG   reported third quarter 2016 adjusted operating earnings of  1 06 cents per share  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by roughly 11 6   Earnings also grew 23 2  year over year 

The outperformance was supported by higher net income and core earnings than third quarter 2015  An 8  decrease in weighted average diluted common shares outstanding also drove the upside 
Growth in net income and core earnings can be mainly attributed to revenue growth on the back of strong performance in commercial lines and Group benefits segment  Also  improvement in personal lines in recent times supported the bottom line growth  Total revenue of The Hartford came in at  4 7 billion  up 13  year over year  Higher net investment income and property and casualty  P C  underwriting results led to the top line improvement 
P C underwriting gain was up  15 million over the prior year quarter  primarily due to improved underwriting results in Commercial Lines Segment Results
Property   Casualty  P C  
Commercial Line
Commercial Lines written premiums were  1 673 million  up 2  year over year  This was because the 5  growth in Small Commercial was partially offset by a 1  decline in Middle Market and a 4  decline in Specialty Commercial  Also  growth in Small Commercial business due the acquisition of Maxum Specialty Insurance Group contributed to the improvement 
Net income in the third quarter increased 29  to  272 million and core earnings rose 14 3  to  247 million  both on a year over year basis  Net realized capital gains of  25 million  which compared unfavorably with net realized capital losses of  12 million in the prior year quarter  drove the upside 
Underwriting gain was  103 million for a combined ratio of 93 9  as against an underwriting gain of  90 million for a combined ratio of 94 5  in the year ago quarter 
Underwriting gain increased 14   while combined ratio improved 40 basis points  This was mainly because of lower unfavorable PYD  higher earned premiums and reduced expenses  The positives  however  were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses 
Catastrophe losses were  43 million in third quarter  primarily due to wind and hailstorms  This segment had incurred catastrophe losses of  8 million in third quarter 2015 
Personal Line
Net income in the third quarter increased 52  year over year to  29 million  primarily due to a lower underwriting loss of  2 million for a combined ratio of 100 2   The improvement in underwriting loss and combined ratio was supported by reduced catastrophe losses and lower underwriting expenses  partially offset by higher current accident year personal automobile losses and slightly unfavorable PYD 
Personal Lines written premiums were  1 billion  down 3  year over year  Lower retention in the AARP Agency and Other Agency channels along with a lower new business as a result price increases led to the downside 
Group Benefits 
This segment generated net income of  62 million  up 47 6  year over year  primarily due to higher net realized capital gains  Core earnings increased 8 5  year over year to  51 million due to higher earned premiums  lower group disability losses and reduced expenses  partially offset by higher group life losses 
Net income margin improved 180 basis points  bps  year over year to 6 7   Core earnings margin expanded 10 bps to 5 6  
Total loss ratio was 79 1   up 230 bps from the third quarter of 2015 as higher group life loss ratio resulted in higher group life claims severity Group Benefits  fully insured ongoing premiums inched up 5  to  792 million due to strong persistency and increased pricing Mutual Funds 
Net income at the Mutual Funds segment was  21 million  down 5  year over year due to lower investment management fees from a shift to lower fee mutual funds  Also  higher expenses incurred due to the acquisition of Lattice Strategies led to a decline in net income 
Average  Asset Under Maintenance  AUM increased 0 6  year over year to  93 0 billion  mainly due to market appreciation  The improvement was largely offset by the continued runoff of Talcott Resolution 
Talcott Resolution 
Talcott Resolution net income  78 million grew 5  over the prior year quarter due to a lower unlock charge  This was partially offset by a reinsurance gain on dispositions in third quarter 2015 
Core earnings were  104 million  down 3  year over year  This is because of  lower fee income due to the runoff of the annuity block and lesser net investment income from fixed maturities 
Talcott Resolution net investment income from LPs totaled  31 million  up from  6 million in the year ago quarter 
Corporate  The Corporate segment recorded net loss of  55 million  substantially wider than a net loss of  3 million in the prior year quarter  This was primarily due to a third quarter 2015 income tax benefit of  60 million related to the reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance on capital loss carryovers 
However  Corporate core losses were  54 million in the reported quarter owing to a  9 million improvement from third quarter 2015 due to lower interest expenses and other expenses Financial Update
Net investment income of The Hartford increased by  30 million  after tax  from third quarter 2015  This upside was primarily driven by a  48 million  after tax  increase in investment income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments 
The Hartford s stockholders  equity came in  18 7 billion as of Sep 30  2016  up 6   from  17 6 billion at year end 2015  The increase was primarily driven by a  1 3 billion increase in AOCI from Dec 31  2015  which largely reflects the impact of lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads on the fair value of the company s fixed income investment portfolio  Book value per diluted share increased roughly 12  to  48 30 from year end 2015  Excluding AOCI  The Hartford s book value per share came in at  45 74 as of Sep 30  2016  up 5  from the that as of Dec 31  2015 Share Repurchases and Dividend UpdateIn Oct 2016  the board of directors authorized a new  1 3 billion equity repurchase plan for common shares to remain effective between Oct  31  2016 and Dec  31  2017  This new program is an addition to the Hartford s current  4 4 billion equity repurchase plan  which is scheduled to expire on Dec 31  2016

96441,317956,PGR,Aon  AON  Q3 Earnings Beat On Organic Revenue Growth,opinion,"Aon plc s   NYSE AON   third quarter 2016 adjusted operating earnings of  1 29 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 28  Earnings also increased 4  from the year ago quarter on the back of solid revenue growth across both Risk and HR Solutions 

Aon s total revenue of  2 7 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 8 billion  Revenues remained flat year over year  This was because a 4  year over year increase in organic revenues in commissions and fees was fully offset by a 2  unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 2  decrease in commissions and fees related to divestitures  net of acquisitions Operating expenses also remained flat year over year at  2 3 billion  In the reported quarter  Aon witnessed a favorable impact from foreign currency translation  a decrease in expenses related to divestitures  net of acquisitions   and a decrease in intangible asset amortization  However  the positives were fully offset by an increase in expense to support organic revenue growth  the unfavorable impact of the timing of certain compensation expenses  an increase in errors and omissions expenses  and certain amount of legacy information technology contract costs 
Segmental UpdateHR Solutions 
Total revenue of  1 billion decreased 2  year over year due to a 4  decrease in commissions and fees associated with net divestitures and a 2  unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation  Nonetheless  organic growth in commissions and fees of 4  partially mitigated the downside 
On a year over year basis  organic revenues in Consulting increased 3  to  459 million due to growth in retirement consulting for delegated investment consulting services and improvement in communications consulting  On the other hand  organic revenues in outsourcing were up 5  to  593 million on the back of robust growth in HR BPO and project related work in health care exchanges  partially offset by an anticipated modest decline in benefits administration 
Compensation and benefits were down 5  year over year owing to a  31 million decrease in expenses related to net divestitures and a  10 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation  This was partially offset by an increase in expense to support 4  organic revenue growth  Other general expenses rose by  7 million over the year ago quarter due to an increase of  7 million of certain legacy information technology contract costs  partially offset by a  9 million decrease in expenses related to net divestitures  a  7 million decrease in intangible asset amortization from previous acquisitions  and a  6 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation Adjusted operating income decreased 4  year over year to  178 million  The adjusted operating margin contracted 30 basis points  bps  to 17 1  during the quarter  This downside was primarily driven by a 70 bps unfavorable impact from certain legacy information technology contract costs  a 70 bps unfavorable impact related to previous portfolio repositioning activity and a 20 bps unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation  partially offset by solid organic revenue growth of 4  Risk Solutions 
Total revenue of  1 7 billion grew 2  over the year ago quarter owing to 3  organic growth in commissions and fees and a 1  increase in commissions and fees related to acquisitions  net of divestitures  partially offset by a 2  unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation  all on year over year basis 
Retail organic revenues of  1 4 billion rose 4  over the prior year quarter due to organic revenue growth in both the Americas and International businesses  Reinsurance organic revenue of  332 million reflected 1  year over year growth on the back of new business generation in treaty and growth in facultative placements  partially offset by an unfavorable market impact globally 
Compensation and benefits dropped 1  year over year mainly because of a  20 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation  partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the timing of certain compensation expenses  Other general expenses also 6  owing to an increase in expense to support 3  organic revenue growth in the quarter and a  9 million increase in errors and omissions expenses  though  14 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation was a partial offset 
Adjusted operating income increased 2  to  358 million  and operating margin increased 10 bps to 20 9   This upside was mainly driven by solid organic revenue growth of 3  and an 80 bps favorable impact from foreign currency translation  However  it was partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the timing of certain compensation expenses and a 50 bps unfavorable impact from higher errors and omissions expenses 
Financial PositionAs of Sep 30  2016  cash and cash equivalents of Aon were  483 million  up 25 8  from year end 2015  However  total assets were  25 2 billion  down 6 7  from  26 9 billion at the end of 2015 Long term debt was  5 9 billion as of Sep 30  2016  up 15 7  from  5 1 billion on Dec 31  2015  However  total liabilities plunged 5 3  year over year to  19 7 billion Cash flow from operations for the first nine months of 2016 rose 14  to  1 5 billion year over year  mainly due to lower pension contributions  an increase in net income  underlying working capital improvements  and lower cash tax payments 
Free cash flow for the first nine months was  1 3 billion after a 24  year over year increase caused by a growth in cash flow from operations and a drop in capital expenditures 
Dividend and Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the first nine months of 2016  Aon paid  258 million of cash dividend to its common stockholders Aon bought back 2 7 million Class A Ordinary Shares for approximately  300 million in the reported quarter  As of Sep 30  2016  it had  3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into another holiday shortened week  and one that should prove to be very light on everything  sees the equity markets have rebounded but are still looking vulnerable  especially the N SPY 
Elsewhere look for gold to consolidate in its downtrend while crude oil continues a bounce in its downtrend  The US dollar index looks to be weaker short term in consolidation while US Treasuries consolidate  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue consolidation with an upward bias while Emerging Markets bounce in their consolidation of the downward move 
Volatility looks to remain subdued  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETFs SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  Their charts agree with that in the short term with the IWM looking the strongest  In the intermediate term  the SPY looks weakest while the IWM and QQQ continue the sideways churn  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

96645,318160,PGR,5 Weekend Developments  What s Signal  What s Noise  ,opinion,The weekend has produced five talking points  The leaked French Socialist draft document that was critical of Germany  and the UK  and the Bundesbank s letter to the German Constitutional Court objecting to the ECB s Outright Market Transactions do not really reveal anything new and we do not expect them to influence trading in the new week   The Iceland election and the formation of a new Italian government are important  An Austrian weekly is claiming that national central bank estimates that to wind down a nationalized bank by the end of this year as the EU is demanding would cost the government 14 bln euros or  4 5  of GDP  We recognize this as potentially important  but not immediately a market factor   That in private moments the French Socialists are critical of Germany and Merkel is a dog bites man story  even if the Financial Times thought it worthy of front page coverage over the weekend  The tensions between the French Socialists and the conservatives are not new or unilateral  Nowhere in the FT s coverage  for example  is one reminded that Merkel campaigned  as much as a German Chancellor could  for Hollande s rival  Sarkozy  Nor is there any reference to the recent German criticism of the weakness of the French government  with claims among other things that the French finance minister had to be woken at a recent crisis gathering   The fact of the matter is that Germany is acting like a creditor and France is acting like a debtor  When the situation was reversed  France acted like a creditor and Germany a debtor  It was France that Germany was critical of for  selfish intransigence  and only thinking about French savers  which is the French Socialists accusation of Merkel   France wants to blame Merkel on one hand  and the UK s Cameron on the other hand  for the strains in the  European project   There is enough blame to go around  but Hollande and the French Socialists should recognize the responsibility of France as well  Hollande has failed to articulate a clear and viable alternative to Germany s vision  A large part of the reason for this is France s failure to enact structural reforms to ensure the continued competitiveness of its economy   While we have often warned of the tragedy of France  that it is being squeezed from Germany above and now from the reforms and falling unit labor costs in the periphery from below  we recognize that French bonds continue to trade like slightly higher yielding German bunds  This removes some sense of urgency  though a rise to record levels of French unemployment may become a more explosive political force   That the Bundesbank is opposed to the ECB s Open Market Transaction has been known since the OMT was first unveiled over the German ECB members  objections  OMT requires an agreement on conditionality with the EU  which means that OMT is not a unilateral tool of the ECB   Moreover  interest rates in the periphery  especially Spain and Italy  have subsequently fallen more than one would have imagined they might  should OMT have been triggered  Indeed  with the EU signaling that it will 1  give some countries  including Spain  more time to reach the fiscal goals and 2  that it will place more emphasis on structural rather than cyclical deficits  there is a good chance that OMT is not triggered   The BBK s objections have formally been presented to the German Constitutional Court  The Court is scheduled to make a ruling on the legality of OMT on June 12  This is the most recent issue on the broader issue of European integration that has been brought before the court  The Constitutional Court walks a fine line  allowing for integration but at the same time preserving an important role for the German parliament   This is what happened last September  The court ruled in favor of the European Stabilization Mechanism  but limited German participation to 200 bln euros and required German parliamentary consent of any distribution of funds  which is why the German parliament voted on the package for Cyprus  though the Cypriot parliament did not    The weekend election in Iceland resulted in a resounding defeat for the Social Democratic Alliance that has led the country over the past four years  The Independent Party and the Progressive Party  which oversaw the overreach of the banking sector and the financial crisis  have been returned to office on a populist agenda of cutting taxes  writing down mortgage debt and opposition to EU membership   Monetary sovereignty and the ability to devalue has not been the panacea that many of those advocating for that  or for one or more of the current debtor countries  Greece  Cyprus  Portugal  Spain or Italy should leave the EMU and devalue have seemed to suggest  This might also be one of the take aways from the UK s experience  Though its economy did surprise to the upside last week  with a 0 3  expansion in Q1  the ability to pursue an independent monetary policy does not appear to have produced superior economic results or even stronger exports   An estimated 80  of Iceland s household debt is linked to inflation  This means that the higher inflation that the country has experienced has not helped the debtors  Moreover  unemployment is twice what it was prior to the crisis  Capital controls  instituted in 2008  remain in place  Perhaps the most telling sin of the outgoing government was in its choice of friends  The IMF supported the Social Democratic Alliance   The Icelandic election is a cautionary tale and is consistent with the swing in the pendulum away from the austerian agenda  It warns other European countries that they must deliver better economic conditions or face the wrath of voters  It is a reminder that there are no easy answers  like simply exiting from the EMU   After nearly two months since the election  Italy has a new government  Not just any government  but a coalition government with the center right  center left  centrists and a couple of technocrats  Grillo s 5 Star Movement is where it is most comfortable  in opposition  and is joined there by the far right and far left   The government is bolder than anyone anticipated  It is younger and more female  The average age of the cabinet fell a full decade to 53 years and a record 7 ministries will be run by women  There is the first African in the cabinet  as well   The new cabinet will have two technocrats and 3 centrists  Berlusconi s center right will be represented in 5 ministries and the center left in 9  Although Berlusconi s ally  Alfano will be the deputy prime minister  as had previously been tipped  he did not get the justice ministry as Berlusconi had insisted upon  Instead  Alfano got the interior ministry portfolio  Draghi s ally and Director General of the Bank of Italy  Saccomanni will be the Economic and Finance Minister  Emma Bonino will be the new Foreign Minister   Many observers quickly judged Berlusconi to be the big winner  If this is true  it is largely because  once again  his opposition shot themselves in the foot  Bersani ran a poor campaign to begin with and then dismally failed to rally his own party behind not one but two presidential candidates  The fissures in the center left are the primary reason that the tenure of the Letta government rests largely in the hands of the center right   There are two important agenda items  which  once they are implemented  puts the government at the mercy of Berlusconi s political calculations as was the Monti government  First  is to get rid of the terribly unpopular tax imposed by Monti on primary residences  Berlusconi s demand that past tax payments be returned is not practical or very likely  but the elimination of this tax could help household finances and may underpin consumption  If this were to happen  a decline in revenues from the property tax may be blunted by an increase in VAT collection   The second issue is electoral reform  There is nearly universal recognition of the need for reform  the disagreement is over the shape of the reform  It is a tricky issue and partisan interests will run high  Polls show if an election were held today  Berlusconi s center right would win  With the left in disarray  Berlusconi appears to be the only force that can check Grillio and the 5 Star Movement  The center left has at least a few months to try to heal its wounds  otherwise they risk Berlusconi picking their bones   Contrary to the numerous and repeated claims of the demise of the political elite in Italy  it seems very much alive  Grillo dismissed the new government as an elite coup d etat  It is not coincidence that Letta s uncle is a close advisor to Berlusconi  The broader  younger and more representative cabinet speaks to the elite s ability to draw new blood and ideas  Saccomanni at the finance ministry will soothe some anxiety Europe and the EC   An Austrian weekly paper will reveal today that according to the Austrian central bank the cost of winding down the nationalized Hyper Alpe Adria Bank International would cost the government as much as 4 5  of GDP  The implication is that this amount could force Austria to seek assistance from the ESM  The EU may be persuaded to give the government more time to sell off the viable parts of the bank  but even then the central bank estimates that it could cost 5 bln euros or 1 6  of GDP   We have recognized that the crisis has bled into the core from the periphery in Europe  France

96649,318164,PGR,Market Outlook  United States  Best Of Breed In 2015,opinion,"What a year for the market in 2014  It was so good that it seems there is general consensus that 2015 cannot be very good  No longer does the market wonder  if  the Federal Reserve will raise rate  The question is  when   and most of the dialogue suggests that a rise in rates will be bad for the stock market 
Federal Reserve Policy Positives
The other question is what  if any  long term damage has been done by keeping interests rates artificially low for so long  I think the alternative  i e  raising rates sooner  would have been worse  A more austere monetary strategy would have likely put lots more people out of work and torpedoed consumer sentiment  One could argue that the pain of a more austere monetary policy would have been good for the long term as we would have pulled out of the deeper economic downturn with more strength and conviction 
Given the economic challenges for the rest of the world  I am not sure how much good it does for the US economy to be much stronger than it already is  We are already head and shoulders above most of the rest of the world  Many of the other major developed countries are beginning to realize that their fiscal and monetary policies have been significantly less successful than ours  They are looking at potential major overhauls while we are most likely looking at some relatively minor course corrections 
This difference is highly impactful to long term economic growth potential because of its implications on investment decisions in the near and long term 

Challenges Abroad Creates Opportunities at Home
If you were starting a business and could choose anywhere in the world  where would you start it  It is hard to make a straight faced argument against starting a business in the United States  Accordingly  it is hard to argue against the idea that the most talented business people in the world would want to be in the United States 
Given the current state of affairs in other major developed countries  it is hard to think of a time when it was clearer that the United States was the best place for productive people to live and work  One of the most defining characteristics of the United States is that it is the number one destination for the people willing work as hard as it takes to achieve the highest returns on capital possible  At the same time  we have been one of the least attractive destinations for people looking to be entirely unproductive or focused on terrorism 
Sure  we have seen a rise in terrorism within our borders  but that rise has not been as bad as the rest of the world 

Capitalism May Not Be Perfect  But it is The Best 
There are valid concerns about the social stability of certain major world powers  I think the lack of fiscal discipline and the pitfalls of socialist economic policies in certain European countries are coming back to haunt them in the form of lower growth and growth potential  A terrible by product of this lower growth and potential is under utilization of capital and people  Long term underemployment is the breeding ground of resentment and discontent  which is exactly where terrorists go to recruit 
The recent terror issues in France are born from the economic weakness caused by the lack of fiscal discipline and the pitfalls of socialist economic policies  These are problems that are difficult to repair  just as it is hard to unspill milk   Those problems are far more easily avoided taking measures early to ensure that those willing to work harder to achieve more are allowed to do so  Redistributing wealth to the point where the most productive people are driven off has lasting consequences  Their departure creates a void of productivity  creativity and leadership 
No doubt that the United States benefits from this trend as well 
I am not sure of the extent of the damage done or the cost to repair in places like France  Perhaps  there is enough economic well being and production to keep everyone happy long term if not in the short term 
I am sure that the United States continues to pull away from the rest of the world 
In his 1992 book    Francis Fukuyama makes the point 

 What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War  or the passing of a particular period of post war history  but the end of history as such  that is  the end point of mankind s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government  

The experiences of the last 20  years suggest that Mr  Fukuyama was right and continues to be right 

Uncharted Waters Ahead
In my 1Q13 letter  I wrote that  
Funny  for 1Q15  I feel pretty much the same way  The current global fiscal  monetary and social policy experimenting is absolutely fascinating  We are in uncharted waters 
No doubt there will be more volatility in the market  Fed tightening is coming   thought I cannot say when I expect it will be after the Fed feels a stronger dollar will not blow up any other major currencies  Effectively  now the Fed needs to keep monetary policy loose now for the rest of the world more than the United States  A sharp rise in rates now would make the dollar even stronger and likely torpedo our exports and put more pressure on struggling economies  No need for us to be a bully here  except with Putin of course where we hardly have a choice 
Whenever the Fed tightening comes  it will be very gradual  Long term interest rates will not rocket up  We will likely not see much of a change in rates for quite some time  not until more of the global economy  outside of the US  gets back on its feet 

Will Normalcy Return in 2015 
Previously  I ve noted that the impact of share buybacks over the past decade plays a role in pushing the market higher  The total number of shares available in US markets is as much as 10  lower  according to some reports  than it was 10 years ago  No doubt the diminished supply of shares means demand is relatively higher and providing support to stocks at least in the near term 
I see this trend changing and the supply demand dynamic shifting back toward a more normal balance  Clearly  supply is on the rise as banks and companies look to cash in on the high valuations  Look at all the IPOs that Wall Street has been rapidly firing already in 2015  Moreover  as global growth slows  firms have less cash to spend on buyback while many have already borrowed heavily to subsidize buybacks 
I do not see the demand for US  denominated securities waning at all  If anything  it will remain strong  Where else are global investors going to put their money in the near term  This steady demand will help support US markets 
And as long as demand stays high  we can expect Wall Street to appease it with plenty of supply  Consequently  I think the supply demand situation will improve on the margin but not by much   no major upheavals in sight 

A Winning Strategy
Our strategy remains focused on buying and holding low risk stocks with strong cash flows  high ROIC and cheap valuations  For example  Progressive Corporation  NYSE PGR   Oracle Corporation  NYSE ORCL  and Stryker Corporation  NYSE SYK  continue to be good performers for our portfolio  We continue to find stocks that have strong enough fundamentals to withstand the inevitable market pullbacks we can expect over the next several months  There are still plenty of pockets of opportunity for good long positions ",2015-03-19,David Trainer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-outlook:-united-states:-best-of-breed-in-2015-245554,245554
96650,318165,PGR,More Top Trade Ideas  Week Of August 10  2015,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
American Electric Power  NYSE AEP 
American Electric Power pulled back from a peak at the end of January when it was minus 10 degrees here in Cleveland  It consolidated in the spring before a dip lower to end June  Since that bottom  it has been rising  and is now above the 200 day SMA again and nearing prior resistance  Over the short term  the RSI has moved into the bullish zone  and is rising while the MACD is also pointing higher 
BioMarin Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ BMRN 
BioMarin Pharmaceuticals broke above an ascending triangle in June  It ran to a high near 150  short of the 160 target  and has reversed lower  Friday it retested the break out level and touched the 100 day SMA  finishing with a Hammer candle  This candle is a sign of intraday strength and can lead to a reversal of trend when confirmed higher the next day  There is still an open gap below though  The RSI and MACD are both in the bearish zone and pointing lower 
Rockwell Collins  NYSE COL 
Rockwell Collins had a long run higher to a peak just under 100 in May  Since then it has pulled back  slowly at first but with a vengeance on high volume in mid July  It has consolidated that move the last two weeks and is pressing against resistance with a Friday finish at the high of the day  The RSI is working off the oversold condition and the MACD is about to cross up  Watch for a break out higher or fall out of consolidation 
Progressive  NYSE PGR 
Progressive rolled higher in a crescendo peaking in early July  After a slight pullback  it has been consolidating over support with the Bollinger Bands  squeezing in  This is often a precursor to a big move  This consolidation also reconnected the price with the 20 day SMA  The RSI is bullish and the MACD falling 
Tractor Supply  NASDAQ TSCO 
Tractor Supply has been moving higher along a rising trend line since February  The trend line has been running along the 100 day SMA since May and is parallel to the 20 and 50 day SMA s just above  Recently  it pulled back from the top of the Bollinger Bands and found that 20 day SMA  Friday saw some strength  as it bounced near that trend line and off of the lower Bollinger Band as they are squeezing 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into next week  sees the news and earnings dry up and Equities could use some quiet time to steady 
Elsewhere  look for a possible bounce out of gold in its downtrend  while crude oil continues lower  The US dollar index looks to continue to consolidate with an upward bias  while US Treasuries continue higher  The Shanghai Composite remains in broad consolidation in the pullback  while Emerging Markets look like they may break a 4 year range to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain subdued  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  despite the moves lower  Their charts show further short term weakness possible  but the Hammer candles could confirm a short term bottom  On the longer timeframe  the IWM remains weakest  with the SPY consolidating and the QQQ looking strong  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

96672,318187,PGR,3 Dividend Stocks That Are As Reliable As Death And Taxes,opinion, The only certainties in life are death and taxes   Everyone s familiar with this old adage  Given the uncertainty of this economic recovery  wouldn t it be nice to have an investment that is equally as reliable The good news is income investors can come pretty close to this and lock in predictable returns by owning stocks of companies that operate in these fields    death and taxes It may sound morbid  but death is a growing business  The U S  Census Bureau estimates that roughly 2 5 million Americans die each year  and the aging population of baby boomers means the mortality rate is likely to rise in the coming years  At present  the annual death rate should hover near 8 3 deaths for every 1 000 Americans  but the progressive aging of the U S  population will trigger steady growth of the death rate to about 9 7 deaths per 1 000 Americans in the next 20 years    Taxes  on the other hand  might not be quite as morbid as death  but it s still unpleasant  And between that and the fact that our tax code is overwhelmingly complicated  people need help getting their affairs in order when Uncle Sam comes knocking    Here are two death care stocks and a tax services stock that pay rich dividends    1  Hillenbrand Inc   NYSE  HI  Yield  4    Hillenbrand is a major player in the death care industry  The company s subsidiary  Bateville Casket Co   is the world s largest manufacturer of caskets  holding a nearly 50  share of the market  Hillenbrand re invests reliable cash flow generated by its casket segment in its fast growing process equipment businesses  This includes K Tron  which makes conveyer equipment  Rotex  a manufacturer of sifters and separation equipment  and the Size Reduction Group  which makes crushers that process 75  of all the coal produced in the United States    Hillenbrand was spun off from its former parent Hill Rom  NYSE  HRC  in 2008  so it has a short history as a public company  though Batesville has been making caskets for more than 100 years  In the past five years  Hillenbrand has grown sales by 9  a year and increased earnings at a 5  annual rate    Last year  the company easily beat analyst estimates by delivering  883 4 million in revenue  an 18  increase from 2010  Its  106 1 million in earnings was a 15  improvement from the year ago period  Hillenbrand expects 13  to 17  revenue growth in 2012  which will likely be fueled by double digit growth in the process equipment segment  Earnings growth is expected to be flat this year due to the absence of one time items that boosted the company s income statement in 2011    Despite that  analysts say Hillenbrand could achieve at least 8  earnings growth in each of the next five years    Dividend growth has averaged a rich 13  a year  but recent dividend hikes have been more modest because Hillenbrand has been more focused on paying down acquisition related debt  The last increase was a  0 01 hike in December 2011 to a  0 77 annual rate  Still  payout is affordable at just 42  of earnings  while the yield is generous at almost 4   Stronger dividend increases are likely as debt declines  2   Stonemor Partners L P   NYSE  STON  Yield  9  Stonemor Partners is the nation s second largest owner and operator of funeral homes  The limited partnership operates 272 cemeteries and 69 funeral homes in 28 states and Puerto Rico    The business grows by acquisitions and is finding ample purchase opportunities  Revenue has grown 15  a year for the past five years  In 2011 alone  revenue improved 16  to  228 million as a result of acquisitions that were concluded during the year  While operating profits improved 28  to  48 6 million in comparison with 2010  a  9 7 million net loss was recorded due to non recurring items and events    Stonmor s distributable cash flow rose 29  last year to  49 3 million  which readily covered  44 6 million of distributions  Analysts expect Stonemor to deliver 13  income growth in each of the next five years  Dividends have risen each of the past seven years to the current  2 34 annualized rate  giving the shares a generous yield of almost 9     3  H R Block  NYSE  HRB  Yield  5   One of the world s largest tax services providers  H R Block mainly competes with Intuit  Nasdaq  INTU  and Jackson Hewitt  H R Block estimates it prepares one in every seven U S  tax returns    Aggressive ad spending paid off with a second straight year of client growth in 2011 and a record 22 2 million tax returns prepared    nearly 1 million more clients than 2010  This steady performer has produced 9  yearly growth for five years  but because it s dealing with higher costs this year  it plans to cut  100 million from spending by closing 200 company owned stores  No earnings growth is expected in fiscal 2012  ending in April   but analyst say growth will resume next year and average 12  in each of the next five years    H R Block has a 35 year dividend history  The last increase was in December 2011  with a huge 33  boost that pushed the yield above 5   The 48  payout ratio means H R Block should be able to maintain or even increase dividends going forward    Risks to consider  H R Block faces sizable legal claims relating to a shuttered subprime mortgage unit  Stonmor s heavy  194 million debt is a concern  since it exceeds  180 million of stockholder equity  The balance sheet is improving  however  and ratings agency Standard   Poor s recently upgraded Stonmor s corporate debt rating from  CCC   to  B       My top pick overall is Stonmor Partners  If you like generous yields and predictable growth  then this limited partnership is hard to beat  Investors who want more diversification and upside potential with their income may prefer Hillenbrand for its fast growing processing equipment businesses  H R Block offers a nice yield and could be a good choice once all the legal claims against its Sand Canyon mortgage subsidiary are finally resolved  But in the long term  all three of these stocks are fit to provide investors with reliable dividend payments  by Lisa

96673,318188,PGR,Mitt Romney And The New Gilded Age,opinion,The election of 2012 raises two perplexing questions  The first is how the GOP could put up someone for president who so brazenly epitomizes the excesses of casino capitalism that have nearly destroyed the economy and overwhelmed our democracy  The second is why the Democrats have failed to point this out The White House has criticized Mitt Romney for his years at the helm of Bain Capital  pointing to a deal that led to the bankruptcy of GS Technologies  a Bain investment in Kansas City that went belly up in 2001 at the cost of 750 jobs  But the White House hasn t connected Romney s Bain to the larger scourge of casino capitalism  Not surprisingly  its criticism has quickly degenerated into a  he said  she said  feud over what proportion of the companies that Bain bought and loaded up with debt subsequently went broke  it s about 20 percent   and how many people lost their jobs relative to how many jobs were added because of Bain s financial maneuvers  that depends on when you start and stop the clock   And it has invited a Republican countercharge that the administration gambled away taxpayer money on its own bad bet  the Solyndra solar panel company But the real issue here isn t Bain s betting record  It s that Romney s Bain is part of the same system as Jamie Dimon s JPMorgan Chase  Jon Corzine s MF Global and Lloyd Blankfein s Goldman Sachs a system that has turned much of the economy into a betting parlor that nearly imploded in 2008  destroying millions of jobs and devastating household incomes  The winners in this system are top Wall Street executives and traders  private equity managers and hedge fund moguls   and the losers are most of the rest of us  The system is largely responsible for the greatest concentration of the nation s income and wealth at the very top since the Gilded Age of the nineteenth century  with the richest 400 Americans owning as much as the bottom 150 million put together  And these multimillionaires and billionaires are now actively buying the 2012 election and with it  American democracy The biggest players in this system have  like Romney  made their profits placing big bets with other people s money  If the bets go well  the players make out like bandits  If they go badly  the burden lands on average workers and taxpayers  The 750 peo  ple at GS Technologies who lost their jobs thanks to a bad deal engineered by Romney s Bain were a small foreshadowing of the 15 million who lost jobs after the cumulative dealmaking  of the entire financial sector pushed the whole economy off a cliff  And relative to the cost to taxpayers of bailing out Wall Street  Solyndra is a rounding error Connect the dots of casino capitalism  and you get Mitt Romney  The fortunes raked in by financial dealmakers depend on special goodies baked into the tax code such as  carried interest   which allows Romney and other partners in private equity firms  as well as in many venture capital and hedge funds  to treat their incomes as capital gains taxed at a maximum of 15 percent  This is how Romney managed to pay an average of 14 percent on more than  42 million of combined income in 2010 and 2011  But the carried interest loophole makes no economic sense  Conservatives try to justify the tax code s generous preference for capital gains as a reward to risk takers but Romney and other private equity partners risk little  if any  of their personal wealth  They mostly bet with other investors  money  including the pension savings of average working people Another goodie allows private equity partners to sock away almost any amount of their earnings into a tax deferred IRA  while the rest of us are limited to a few thousand dollars a year  The partners can merely low ball the value of whatever portion of their investment partnership they put away even valuing it at zero because the tax code considers a partnership interest to have value only in the future  This explains how Romney s IRA is worth as much as  101 million  The tax code further subsidizes private equity and much of the rest of the financial sector by making interest on debt tax deductible  while taxing profits and dividends  This creates huge incentives for financiers to find ways of substituting debt for equity and is a major reason America s biggest banks have leveraged America to the hilt  It s also why Romney s Bain and other private equity partnerships have done the same to the companies they buy These maneuvers shift all the economic risk to debtors  who sometimes can t repay what they owe  That s rarely a problem for the financiers who engineer the deals  they re sufficiently diversified to withstand some losses  or they ve already taken their profits and moved on  But piles of debt play havoc with the lives of real people in the real economy when the companies they work for can t meet their payments  or the banks they rely on stop lending money  or the contractors they depend on go broke often with the result that they can t meet their own debt payments and lose their homes  cars and savings It took more than a decade for America to recover from the Great Crash of 1929 after the financial sector had gorged itself on debt  and it s taking years to recover from the more limited but still terrible crash of 2008  The same kinds of convulsions have occurred on a smaller scale at a host of companies since the go go years of the 1980s  when private equity firms like Bain began doing leveraged buyouts taking over a target company  loading it up with debt  using the tax deduction that comes with the debt to boost the target company s profits  cutting payrolls and then reselling the company at a higher price Sometimes these maneuvers work  sometimes they end in disaster  but they always generate giant rewards for the dealmakers while shifting the risk to workers and taxpayers  In 1988 drugstore chain Revco went under when it couldn t meet its debt payments on a  1 6 billion leveraged buyout engineered by Salomon Brothers  In 1989 the private equity firm of Kohlberg  Kravis  Roberts completed the notorious and ultimately disastrous buyout of RJR Nabisco for  31 billion  much of it in high yield   junk   bonds  In 1993 Bain Capital became a majority shareholder in GS Technologies and loaded it with debt  In 2001 it went down when it couldn t meet payments on that debt load  But even as these firms sank  Bain and the other dealmakers continued to collect lucrative fees transaction fees  advisory fees  management fees sucking the companies dry until the bitter end  According to a review by the New York Times of firms that went bankrupt on Romney s watch  Bain structured the deals so that its executives would always win  even if employees  creditors and Bain s own investors lost out  That s been Big Finance s MO By the time Romney co founded Bain Capital in 1984  financial wheeling and dealing was the most lucrative part of the economy  sucking into its Gordon Gekko like maw the brightest and most ambitious MBAs  who wanted nothing more than to make huge amounts of money as quickly as possible  Between the mid 1980s and 2007  financial sector earnings made up two thirds of all the growth in incomes  At the same time  wages for most Americans stagnated as employers  under mounting pressure from Wall Street and private equity firms like Bain  slashed payrolls and shipped jobs overseas The 2008 crash only briefly interrupted the bonanza  Last year  according to a recent Bloomberg Markets analysis  America s top fifty financial CEOs got a 20 4 percent pay hike  even as the wages of most Americans continued to drop  Topping the Bloomberg list were two of the same private equity barons who did the RJR Nabisco deal a quarter century ago Henry Kravis and George Roberts  who took home  30 million each  According to the 2011 tax records he released  Romney was not far behind      We ve entered a new Gilded Age  of which Mitt Romney is the perfect reflection  The original Gilded Age was a time of buoyant rich men with flashy white teeth  raging wealth and a measured disdain for anyone lacking those attributes  which was just about everyone else  Romney looks and acts the part perfectly  offhandedly challenging a GOP primary opponent to a  10 000 bet and referring to his wife s several Cadillacs  Four years ago he paid  12 million for his fourth home  a 3 000 square foot villa in La Jolla  California  with vaulted ceilings  five bathrooms  a pool  a Jacuzzi and unobstructed views of the Pacific  Romney has filed plans to tear it down and replace it with a home four times bigger We ve had wealthy presidents before  but they have been traitors to their class Teddy Roosevelt storming against the  malefactors of great wealth  and busting up the trusts  Franklin Roosevelt railing against the  economic royalists  and raising their taxes  John F  Kennedy appealing to the conscience of the nation to conquer poverty  Romney is the opposite  he wants to do everything he can to make the superwealthy even wealthier and the poor even poorer  and he justifies it all with a thinly veiled social Darwinism Not incidentally  social Darwinism was also the reigning philosophy of the original Gilded Age  propounded in America more than a century ago by William Graham Sumner  a professor of political and social science at Yale  who twisted Charles Darwin s insights into a theory to justify the brazen inequality of that era  survival of the fittest  Romney uses the same logic when he accuses President Obama of creating an  entitlement society  simply because millions of desperate Americans have been forced to accept food stamps and unemployment insurance  or when he opines that government should not help distressed homeowners but instead let the market  hit the bottom   or enthuses over a House Republican budget that would cut  3 3 trillion from low income programs over the next decade  It s survival of the fittest all over again  Sumner  too  warned against handouts to people he termed  negligent  shiftless  inefficient  silly  and imprudent  When Romney simultaneously proposes to cut the taxes of households earning over  1 million by an average of  295 874 a year  according to an analysis of his proposals by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center  because the rich are  allegedly   job creators   he mimics Sumner s view that  millionaires are a product of natural selection  acting on the whole body of men to pick out those who can meet the requirement of certain work to be done   In truth  the whole of Republican trickle down economics is nothing but repotted social Darwinism The Gilded Age was also the last time America came close to becoming a plutocracy a system of government of  by and for the wealthy  It was an era when the lackeys of the very rich literally put sacks of money on the desks of pliant legislators  senators bore the nicknames of the giant companies whose interests they served   the senator from Standard Oil    and the kings of finance decided how the American economy would function The potential of great wealth in the hands of a relative few to undermine democratic institutions was a continuing concern in the nineteenth century as railroad  oil and financial magnates accumulated power   Wealth  like suffrage  must be considerably distributed  to support a democratick republic   wrote Virginia Congressman John Taylor as early as 1814   and hence  whatever draws a considerable proportion of either into a few hands  will destroy it  As power follows wealth  the majority must have wealth or lose power   Decades later  progressives like Louis Brandeis saw the choice starkly   We may have democracy  or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few  but we can t have both  The reforms of the Progressive Era at the turn of the twentieth century saved American democracy from the robber barons  but the political power of great wealth has now resurfaced with a vengeance  And here again  Romney is the poster boy  Congress has so far failed to close the absurd carried interest tax loophole  for example  because of generous donations by Bain Capital and other private equity partners to both parties      In the 2012 election  Romney wants everything Wall Street has to offer  and Wall Street seems quite happy to give it to him  Not only is he promising lower taxes in return for its money  he also vows that  if elected  he ll repeal what s left of the Dodd Frank financial reform bill  Washington s frail attempt to prevent the Street from repeating its 2008 pump  and dump  Unlike previous elections  in which the Street hedged its bets by donating to both parties  it s now putting most of its money behind Romney  And courtesy of a Supreme Court majority that seems intent on magnifying the political power of today s robber barons  that s a lot of dough  As of May  thirty one billionaires had contributed between  50 000 and  2 million each to Romney s super PAC  and in June another appropriately enough  a casino magnate gave  10 million  with a promise of  90 million more  Among those who have contributed at least  1 million are former associates from Romney s days at Bain Capital and prominent hedge fund managers To be sure  Romney is no worse than any other casino capitalist of this new Gilded Age  All have been making big bets collecting large sums when they pay off and imposing the risks and costs on the rest of us when they don t  Many have justified their growing wealth  along with the growing impoverishment of much of the rest of the nation  with beliefs strikingly similar to social Darwinism  And a significant number have transformed their winnings into the clout needed to protect the unrestrained betting and tax preferences that have fueled their fortunes  and to lower their tax rates even further  Wall Street has already all but eviscerated the Dodd Frank Act  and it has even turned the so called Volcker Rule a watered down version of the old Glass Steagall Act  which established a firewall between commercial and investment banking into a Swiss cheese of  loopholes and exemptions But Romney is the only casino capitalist who is running for president  at the very time in our nation s history when these views and practices are a clear and present danger to the well being of the rest of us just as they were more than a century ago  Romney says he s a job creating businessman  but in truth he s just another financial dealmaker in the age of the financial deal  a fat cat in an era of excessively corpulent felines  a plutocrat in this new epoch of plutocrats  That the GOP has made him its standard bearer at this point in American history is astonishing So why don t Democrats connect these dots  It s not as if Americans harbor great admiration for financial dealmakers  According to the newly released twenty fifth annual Pew Research Center poll on core values  nearly three quarters of Americans believe  Wall Street only cares about making money for itself   That s not surprising  given that many are still bearing the scars of 2008  Nor are they pleased with the concentration of income and wealth at the top  Polls show a majority of Americans want taxes raised on the very rich  and a majority are opposed to the bailouts  subsidies and special tax breaks with which the wealthy have padded their nests Part of the answer  surely  is that elected Democrats are still almost as beholden to the wealthy for campaign funds as the Republicans  and don t want to bite the hand that feeds them  Wall Street can give most of its largesse to Romney this year and still have enough left over to tame many influential Democrats  look at the outcry from some of them when the White House took on Bain Capital  But I suspect a deeper reason for their reticence is that if they connect the dots and reveal Romney for what he is the epitome of what s fundamentally wrong with our economy they ll be admitting how serious our economic problems really are  They would have to acknowledge that the economic catastrophe that continues to cause us so much suffering is  at its root  a product of the gross inequality of income  wealth and political power in America s new Gilded Age  as well as the perverse incentives of casino capitalism Yet this admission would require that they propose ways of reversing these trends proposals large and bold enough to do the job  Time will tell whether today s Democratic Party and this White House have the courage and imagination to do it  If they do not  that in itself poses almost as great a challenge to the future of the nation as does Mitt Romney and all he represents  I wrote this for this week s  The Nation  Magazine  ,2012-07-01,Robert B.

96675,318190,PGR,America s Unspoken Crisis Is A  War On America ,opinion,Can you imagine the lengths our nation would go to address and eradicate a social situation correlated very highly with activities  including juvenile murder and rape  that land people in prison  Can you further imagine the outcry to address this social situation if it were also highly correlated with an increased risk of suicide  What if over and above those high correlations  this social situation was also very highly correlated with children dropping out of school  Clearly the public outcry would be earth shattering and the march on Washington would be historic in nature  no  If those correlations were not enough to generate the front page eye popping headlines  we have to imagine that the high correlation of this social situation perpetuating a cycle of poverty with accompanying social ills of increased substance abuse  obesity        and more would carry the day  We have just such a social situation in America and I believe it has reached crisis level  Yet  what do we hear  The silence is deafening and dangerous  It is time for America to WAKE UP and start talking about this crisis that envelops our nation and is now  in my opinion  an epidemic  What is this great unspoken social situation that many in power and in the media work so hard to keep conveniently under the rug  Single parent births  Go ahead and rail on me for daring to elevate this issue and demand that it be discussed  Addressing single parent births is part of the  war on women   Stop the nonsense  The unspoken crisis that defines the rapidly escalating rate of single parent births is nothing short of a  War on America   Really  Yes  really  What do you think is going on in  and what drives the growth in gangs that dominate urban neighborhoods across   How is it that I define this crisis as a  war on America   Let s connect some dots and address some raw data on this topic  As evidenced in a comprehensive research piece    the writers conclude        children born to single parents have the most consistently adverse outcomes  What are some of the outcomes  Say what you want about   but she pulls no punches in highlighting that Children raised by a single mother commit 72 percent of juvenile murders  60 percent of rapes  have 70 percent of teenaged births  commit 70 percent of suicides and are 70 percent of high school dropouts  Controlling for socioeconomic status  race and place of residence  the strongest predictor of whether a person will end up in prison is being raised by a single parent  A 1990 study by the Progressive Policy Institute showed that after controlling for single motherhood  the difference in black and white crime disappeared  Please recall what I wrote a few days back in   How often have we heard those supporting Obamacare promote that there are 30 million people uninsured in our nation  Very often  How often have we heard that there are 25 million high school dropouts over the age of 25 in our nation  Not often enough  I do not know the percentage of high school dropouts who are also uninsured but I do know that less than 40  of those over the age of 25 are employed   WSJ  February 21  2012     That fact means we have at least 15 million unemployed dropouts over the age of 25 in America  Think there is probably a decent chance the overwhelming majority of these 15 million are uninsured  You think  The New York Times highlights  Less than 10 percent of the births to college educated women occur outside marriage  while for women with high school degrees or less the figure is nearly 60 percent  Broken down by ethnic groups  single parent families encompass  Approximately 70  of new born African Americans  50  of new born Hispanic children  30  of Caucasians  and 15  of Asian Americans  What is the ultimate reason why I define the growth and accompanying problematic implications of single parent births as a crisis  epidemic  and also a  war on America   Single parent births in America now top 40  of newborns  That statistic stood at 17  three decades ago      While I commend and support every parent   single and married   who works tirelessly to support his her child  the  for our nation s future  Time we start to have a serious national discussion on this issue because at that rate of growth  the decline of our nation will not only continue but will be increasingly swift and painful  You can count on it  So let s get President Obama  Mitt Romney  pols from both sides of the aisle  and others from a variety of agencies and institutions and let s have the national discussion  Let s make sure it is televised in prime time  The social costs   in both hard and soft dollars   connected to single parent births are an insidious and very real war on America  High time for those who care about our nation s future to stand up and put this issue front and center      or I guess we can continue to sit idly by and allow our nation to continue to decline  What is it going to be  What do you think  I welcome hearing from everybody who has an opinion on this most important of national issues  For those who feel and believe differently  along with your opinions  please provide data to support your premise ,2012-07-24,Larry

96676,318191,PGR,On Credit Scores,opinion,To give credit where credit is due  this post was triggered by an article at SmartMoney  10 Things Credit Scores Won t Say In 1996  I got a call from a recruiter suggesting there was a real opportunity with the Philadelphia based corporation Advanta  They were looking for an actuary with investment knowledge that could help them in their joint venture with The Progressive to use credit scores in underwriting auto insurance  Since I was local  and known to be a  nontraditional actuary  with some degree of talent  and my situation at Provident Mutual was deteriorating because of a management change  I accepted the interview Being a life actuary  I didn t know much about P C insurance  but my career had been one of growth  I may not know everything there is to know about a given topic  but I learn rapidly  and bring allied knowledge to the table that others may not possess  The interview was interesting  If you are a life actuary  you don t expect interviews like Advanta  Credit cards were reaching their apex  and some clever people were trying to figure out other ways to apply the data from individuals using credit cards  I ended up being Advanta s  second choice   Bad for them  good for me  Two years later  I would join the St  Paul s Investment department in Baltimore The key idea was that credit scores were highly predictive regarding personal insurance losses  particularly when combined with traditional underwriting metrics  The idea was a surprise to me when I first ran into it  but it quickly made sense to me  Let me explain Honoring agreements that you have entered into is an important indicator of your personality  Those who do not repay are on average less moral than those that repay  Those that are net creditors on average made efforts that net debtors did not Credit scores are important  In a specific way  they measure your willingness to keep your word  Anytime you enter into a debt contract  you make a promise to repay  If you fulfill your promise to repay  you impress others as one of good moral character  If you don t repay  it is vice versa  you appear to be of low moral character   Note  I am excluding those that got hoodwinked by lenders that defrauded borrowers in a variety of ways  That said  if you can be hoodwinked  that says something else about you  and that may have an impact on your creditworthiness as well  Now  before I continue  these concepts work on average  and not always in particular  I have helped some at the edge of society with gifts and loans  In some cases there is a cascade of bad events that the most intelligent would have a hard time facing  Being wise helps  but there are some situations that would tax the soul of anyone  and be difficult to claim that they were blameworthy  it s just the way things happened That said  that concept of a  credit score  traveled rapidly to insurance  because moral character is highly correlated with how a person drives  People who are sloppy with their debts tend to be sloppy with their driving  As with everything in this post  this is only a general tendency  It applies on average  it does not always apply Some US states were offended at P C companies using credit scores  and so the companies moved to use  insurance scores   which were little different from what they aimed to replace  The insurance companies took the disaggregated data behind the credit scores  did a little more research  and discovered which variables were most predictive of insurance claims  in concert with their own data The same is true for many other uses of credit data  Different parties want different aspects of the underlying data  Whether it is employers  lessors  lenders  insurers  etc   in an impersonal world  where there are fewer shared ethical values than in the past  economic actors rely on semi public data to get comfortable about who they are dealing with Two final notes 1  It s easier to go down than up with credit scores  But that is similar to many things in life  One big mistake can undo a hundred lesser things done well 2  Those who pay off debts rapidly are rewarded with discounts  as many companies want to avoid bad debts  You might remember my piece  Build the Buffer  Be wise  and have enough cash around to get discounts over those that pay things monthly quarterly I am happily debt free aside from paying off the debts regularly on my few credit cards  The simple truth is that living within your own means  and having enough of a buffer to deal with minor crises is the best place to be ,2012-08-05,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/on-credit-scores-131997,131997

with what I call good portfolio management  Investors need to tread carefully when considering mid cap value ETFs and mutual funds  as no ETF or mutual funds in the mid cap value style allocate enough value to Attractive or better rated stocks to earn an Attractive rating  Investors should focus on individual stocks instead  Here are two very different stocks that are held by mid cap value mutual funds  The Progressive Corp  PGR  is one of my favorite stocks held my mid cap value funds  PGR receives my Very Attractive rating  PGR has generated positive economic earnings eleven out of the past fourteen years  In 2011 they produced an economic earnings margin of 10 5   This ranks in the 89th percentile of all 3000  companies in our coverage universe  This level of profitability places PGR among the elite  however the market prices its stock amongst the cheapest  PGR currently trades at a price to economic book of 1 0  this implies the company will never grow its after tax operating earnings  NOPAT  beyond current levels  Over the past ten years  PGR has grown its after tax operating earnings 9  compounded annually  Given the company s past  the market appears overly pessimistic about its future  The market s low stock price coupled with PGR s high profitability make it a Very Attractive stock  Equity Lifestyle Properties  Inc   ELS  is one of my least favorite stocks held by mid cap value funds  It receives my Very Dangerous rating  ELS is a value destroyer  Over the past fourteen years  ELS has never produced positive economic earnings  Many investors have flocked into REITs as they offer high dividend yields in this low interest rate environment In seeking this income  they have bid up the price of REITs to the point where they have put their principal at risk  To justify ELS s stock price of  67 58  the company would have to grow its after tax operating earnings  NOPAT  at 15   compounded annually  for the next fourteen years  It is not worth purchasing shares of ELS for its 2 60  dividend yield when the downside risk is so large  Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all mid cap value ETFs and mutual funds  Our style rankings for ETFs and mutual

96680,318195,PGR,The New Economic Normal And What s Ahead,opinion,As this piece went to press  we have just had a huge post U S  fiscal cliff deal global rally  The deal was a disaster as far as fiscal prudence or friendliness to capital was concerned  Republicans and investors  the evil  rich   got rolled  The market exuberance was a case of the man who thought he would be executed and now learned that he will only get life  So he celebrated  But that s the short term  I want to examine some long term issues in this piece  So many of the economic problems and conditions the United States and the world are facing today are new  The markets may not be worried about them now but they will  That in itself presents a big problem  All economic forecasts are implicitly based on one theory or another  But economic theories in turn are inspired by or based on events or institutions that existed in the past  This means that a great deal of what everybody learned about economics and finance may be of limited use in understanding the economic and investment challenges that we face today   New Phenomenon  1    Print Money And There s No Inflation  Under a concept of relatively recent vintage called quantitative easing  the central banks of the world are printing high powered money  the monetary base  with wild abandon  Alarmist forecasts of hyperinflation can be heard around the world  based essentially on monetarist economic reasoning  But so far  we have only modest inflation in countries with  decadent  central banks  Not only that  central banks around the world are actually targeting modest inflation  The basis of monetarist economics is an ancient doctrine called the quantity theory of money  or MV PY  If you double the quantity of money  M   hold the velocity of money  V  constant  PY  the price level times real GDP  doubles  The equation doesn t differentiate between real Y  and price effects  P  but doubling M is bound to wind up mostly affecting P  Money in the quantity theory s original formulations did not allow for fractional reserve banking systems  Money and the monetary base were the same thing in the original quantity theory  In the post WWII fractional reserve environment monetarists have had problems defining whether money is the monetary base or M2  M3 or some other measure of bank liabilities  Milton Friedman  the god of modern monetarism  was a little slippery on this issue  But it didn t matter that much because until the advent of quantitative easing and the financial crisis of 2008  growth of the monetary base in most countries had exhibited a high correlation with the growth of the various Ms  But no longer  The reserves created by the central banks and the so called money multiplier that relates the monetary base to the Ms has collapsed  The Ms have grown much more slowly than the base  Bernanke would argue that it s the Ms that count and that he isn t wildly printing money  But most monetarists are uncomfortable with this explanation  Economic history provides countless examples of countries which printed money and suffered massive inflation as a result  So why hasn t it happened again  One answer might be that it just hasn t happened yet  Be patient  Another is that the world is in the midst of chronic oversupply of tradable goods  thanks to globalization and productivity gains  Real supply side factors are overwhelming demand side money stimuli  A third argument is that the huge debt overhang of the advanced countries is inhibiting an expansion of demand and therefore inflation  I personally believe all three factors are at work  Of course there is the question of whether inflation is as low as the conventional CPI indexes suggest  John Williams of Shadow Government Statistics has argued that the U S  government has rigged the numbers by replacing earlier more conservative inflation measuring techniques and choosing methodological options which understate inflation  A lot of the public would agree with him  The prices of food and non tradable services have risen even if computers get cheaper by the minute  But Williams remains an outlier among economists  New Phenomenon  2    Can We Do Quantitative Easing And Have No Capital Allocation Distortions Bernanke and the other central bankers have driven the so called  risk free  rate to near zero and have driven long rates to relatively low levels  Most observers would agree this has given a big boost to the stock market and I think it will continue to do so in the near term  Where else can investors put their money  But interest rates and stock prices    the cost of capital    are supposed to ration capital  Low interest rates have helped bring about a stock market rally  Quantitative easing has weakened or even eliminated the capital market s main capital allocation tool  Should the stock market be going up in the face of a limp U S  recovery  recession in Europe and Japan and the massive distortions in China s economic system  What are the long term effects of this distortion caused by quantitative easing  I can t find any good answers on this and I don t remember this problem being discussed when  somewhere back in the last century  I was in graduate school  If rates rise to more normal levels  will housing go bust again  If interest rates rise to more normal levels  how many governments will go bust  Residents of Singapore and Hong Kong point to the Fed s quantitative easing as the cause of house price inflation in their cities  It s the current ultra low interest rates that Singapore and Hong Kong worry about  No doubt they have a point  So there is one distortion   But Singapore and Hong Kong are low tax  capital friendly places  There are no Obamas or Hollandes in charge of these cities  It s no surprise money is flowing into these places  with or without quantitative easing  Quantitative easing hasn t produced an influx of money into French real estate    Phenomenon   3    What Happens When Population Growth In Advanced Countries Turns Negative And There Are So Many Old People  The last five centuries have witnessed phenomenal growth in the standard of living in so called advanced countries  This has been accompanied by    driven by     an equally phenomenal growth in population  But what happens to GDP growth when population growth turns negative  When countries become dominated by senior citizens  Is Japan the future for all the advanced countries with their declining birthrates  Again demographics are not incorporated into the main body of economic theory  Economist Alfred Hansen worried about declining birthrates in the Depression 1930s but the subsequent baby boom and the global expansion of population pushed Hansen into the dustbin of forgotten economists  Maybe he will enjoy a revival  Japan has experienced twenty years of stagnation  Is this due to its low birthrate and now actually declining population  The current Japanese population is about 128 million and projections are that if current trends continue it will be just over half that by the end of this century  The Japanese population is increasingly an older population  So the demographic future for Japan is less people and an ever older population    a double whammy  Is quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus a total waste of time in Japan  I have argued that the protectionist and industrial policy driven Japanese East Asian Economic model are at least partly responsible for the poor Japanese economic performance  But it s hard not to wonder that the aging and now declining numbers of the Japanese population are not at least partly responsible for Japan s decline  We have no history to go on  Economist Harry Dent has written extensively on this subject as it applies to the United States  In Dent s view  baby boomers    the dominant group in American population    are now reaching retirement age  Dent argues that their spending will decline and they will dissave  thus depressing the stock market and the economy  Dent has predicted a stock market crash  So far  he s been wrong  So far  Of course there s a silver lining in the Dent cloud  Stocks of companies that cater to old people    health care  biotechnology  drugs  even robots    may do well  Phenomenon   4    Will It Ever Matter that the United States  Debt GDP Ratio Is Likely To Get Substantially Worse  According to the IMF  the General Government Net Debt GDP ratio for the United States is now at the 80  level  This IMF net debt number is the most conservative estimate of the United States  government debt GDP ratio  Other organizations have higher estimates and the IMF s own General Government Gross Debt GDP ratio estimate is up at 103   With official deficits of one trillion plus per year and the outlook for sluggish economic growth at best  it s all but a certainty that the U S  government debt GDP ratio    if it hasn t already    is going to soar well beyond the ninety percent level where Reinhart and Rogoff have concluded economic growth is likely to be negatively affected  The U S  is a poor prospect to grow its way out of its fiscal mess  The just concluded fiscal cliff deal was  for want of a better word  a joke as far as fiscal prudence goes since there were no serious cuts in spending  Moreover  I believe the costs of Obamacare and the probable tax avoidance behavior of the evil  rich  in response to higher taxes have been underestimated  Moreover  according to a recent Wall Street Journal article by Chris Cox and Bill Archer  unfunded U S  entitlement obligations total some  86 trillion  Shadow Government Statistics comes up with similar statistics  The real U S  government deficit  if computed on an accrual basis as the private sector does its accounting  might be several trillion higher  The fatal attraction of populism  whereby the populace votes itself ever more unaffordable benefits  is catching up with the U S  and the rest of the advanced countries as well  The U S  Founding Fathers preferred a republic dominated by property holders over a universal suffrage democracy  They wanted the basic rights of all citizens respected but they feared that in a universal suffrage democracy the more numerous less affluent would vote to expropriate the wealth of the less numerous more affluent  They wanted a world safe from democracy  The trend towards universal suffrage and a more populist government began as early as 1828 in the United States with the election of Andrew Jackson  It accelerated in the United States and Europe with the advent of the Progressive Movement  WWI and the abandonment of the gold standard  Be that as it may  however dismal the outlook for the U S  fiscal situation  the world continues to love U S  government debt  Does this make sense  Like Japan  the worse the U S  does on the fiscal front  the more government bond prices go up  Of course this cannot go on forever  But when and how will it end  Will the bond markets eventually turn on the U S  and Japan as they have already with Greece  Will Fed printing become the sole means of government debt funding and hyperinflation wipe out the government debts in real terms  My own view is that it certainly will end in government defaults broadly defined for both the U S  and Japan  Defaults perhaps not in the legal sense but  defaults  or reneging on a whole host of obligations and entitlements that governments have made to their citizens  In the sense I am using the term  means testing would be a type of default  For example means testing for Medicare benefits is simply a polite way of telling more affluent people that the medical retirement benefit they had paid in for and thought they would receive would no long be available  It s a reneging on an obligation and equivalent to a tax increase   I regard the recent Republican attempt to trade means testing of Medicare benefits for tax increases as economic black comedy  Tax increases in return for tax increases  In the last election the Republicans  dissed  Hispanics  Now they are dissing upper income groups  Who do they represent  Question  Can the stock market keep rising with all this going on   Phenomenon   5    Will the Changing Racial Ethnic Composition Of The United States Have Investment Economic Implications  I believe the fatal attraction of populism in the United States is being intensified by changing demographic and ethnic racial balance of the country  This has investment significance and  however sensitive this subject  investors have to face it  The relative demographic decline of the essentially educationally and income wise successful European origin people in the U S  and the relative rise of a more government dependent  educationally and income lagging Hispanic and African American population has investment implications  The core body of economic theory makes no assumptions or conclusion about racial or ethnic differences  All groups are assumed to on average have equal talents and goals  Discrimination of any sort is regarded as a market imperfection and is undesirable  The history of the United States shows that for some  America has been a land of opportunity and have benefited from the free market  Millions of white European and now non white Asian immigrants    Irish  Jews  Italians  Poles  Chinese and Indians etc     have come to the United States and they or their descendants have prospered  Projections are that African Americans and Hispanics will constitute an ever larger proportion of the American population  By 2050  demographers tell us that there will be no racial or ethnic majority among the general population of the United States  It is projected that the Hispanic population will double to 30   It s dangerous to generalize about African Americans and Hispanics since there are major differences between them  and within the Hispanic category itself  But it s a matter of statistics that overall these groups have not prospered compared to whites and Asians  For example  regarding educational achievement despite all kinds of government programs to improve their performance  African American children have consistently lagged behind white and Asians  Over the last twenty years  the gap has remained  African American family incomes and employment rates compare unfavorably with all other groups  Most Americans would support all reasonable efforts to improve the academic performance of African American  and Hispanic  children  This is in investors  and the national interest  But I must note that so far throwing government money at the problem has not worked  Hopefully a solution to this problem will be found but from the viewpoint of economic and financial forecasting  wishful thinking cannot substitute for analysis  Hispanics offer a more complicated picture  Mexican Americans make up an estimated 63  of the Hispanic population with the bulk of the remainder probably of mixed African white Caribbean origins  The predominantly white  largely professional and better educated Miami Cuban population is atypical of the Hispanic population as a whole  The typical Hispanic  unlike the often highly educated Asian immigrant  arrives in the United States with a low level of education  I have seen statistics showing 50  of Mexican immigrants arrive with less than a high school education  That in itself is a manageable problem  But I have also seen statistics showing that education and income wise the majority of Hispanics show a big improvement from first to second generation and then level off still behind whites and Asians  This is worrisome  This raises two questions  First  in the global knowledge economy  how will the United States compete when a substantial portion of its children are educational underperformers  Second  the underperforming groups exhibit a greater tendency to depend on government and its services   I mention here Charles Murray s latest book  which identifies similar problems of education and income on the lower end of the white population   Obviously  fiscal reform and entitlement cutting will not be a major concern for these groups  The Republicans in the last election kept reciting the high unemployment rate and how that would bring them victory  What were they thinking of  Obama has dramatically expanded the food stamp program  continuously extended unemployment benefits and reopened the welfare door by executive fiat  Obamacare favors Medicaid  whose primary constituency is younger and poorer minority groups  over Medicare  whose primary constituency is older  relatively more affluent whites  It would seem that Obama s plan is to make underperforming groups more dependent on the government and vote Democratic  An irresistible road to serfdom  And reelection  If you were a single parent  without a job and marketable skills  and you were receiving all these government handouts  whom would you vote for  The political party that would maintain or even increase your benefits or the political party that would set you  free  in an economy where you are under skilled and undereducated compared to your competition and are bound to lose  The Republicans  no surprise  did poorly in states where unemployment was the highest I seriously doubt we will see another Ronald Reagan type free market president elected in the United States in our lifetimes  If the Republicans manage to pull themselves together and do get back in power  they will be more like European  conservatives  and not like Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher  These are serious negatives for the American economy in the years to come ,2013-01-08,Peter T.

96695,318210,PGR,22 Reasons Why We Could See An Economic Collapse In Europe In 2012,opinion,Before you dismiss the title of this article as  alarmist   read the facts listed in the rest of this article first   Over the past several months  there has been an astonishing loss of confidence in the European financial system   Right now  virtually nobody wants to loan money to financially troubled nations in the EU and virtually nobody wants to lend money to major European banks   Remember  one of the primary reasons for the financial crisis of 2008 was a major credit crunch that happened here in the United States   This burgeoning credit crunch in Europe is just one element of a  perfect storm  that is rapidly coming together as we get ready to go into 2012   The signs of trouble are everywhere   All over Europe  governments are implementing austerity measures and dramatically cutting back on spending   European banks are substantially cutting back on lending as they seek to meet new capital requirements that are being imposed upon them   Meanwhile  bond yields are going through the roof all over Europe as investors lose confidence and demand much higher returns for investing in European debt   It has become clear that without a miracle happening  quite a few European nations and a significant number of European banks are not going to be able to get the funding that they need from the market in 2012   The only thing that is going to avert a complete and total financial meltdown in Europe is dramatic action  but right now European leaders are so busy squabbling with each other that a bold plan seems out of the question The following are 22 reasons why we could see an economic collapse in Europe in 2012     1Germany could rescue the rest of Europe  but that would take an unprecedented financial commitment  and the German people do not have the stomach for that   It has been estimated that it would cost Germany 7 percent of GDP over several years in order to sufficiently bail out the other financially troubled EU nations   Such an amount would far surpass the incredibly oppressive reparations that Germany was forced to pay out in the aftermath of World War I A host of recent surveys has shown that the German people are steadfastly against bailing out the rest of Europe   For example  according to one recent poll 57 percent of the German people are against the creation of eurobonds At this point  German politicians are firmly opposed to any measure that would place an inordinate burden on German taxpayers  so unless this changes that means that Europe is not going to be saved from within  2 The United States could rescue Europe  but the Obama administration knows that it would be really tough to sell that to the American people during an election season   The following is what White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said today about the potential for a bailout of Europe by the United States         This is something they need to solve and they have the capacity to solve  both financial capacity and political will Carney also said that the Obama administration does not plan to commit any  additional resources  to rescuing Europe         We do not in any way believe that additional resources are required from the United States and from American taxpayers   3Right now  banks all over Europe are in deleveraging mode as they attempt to meet new capital adequacy requirements by next June According to renowned financial journalist Ambrose Evans Pritchard  European banks need to reduce the amount of lending on their books by about 7 trillion dollars in order to get down to safe levels         Europe s banks face a  7 trillion lending contraction to bring their balance sheets in line with the US and Japan  threatening to trap the region in a credit crunch and chronic depression for a decade  So what does that mean It means that European banks are going to be getting really  really stingy with loans That means that it is going to become really hard to buy a home or expand a business in Europe  and that means that the economy of Europe is going to slow down substantially  4 European banks are overloaded with  toxic assets  that they are desperate to get rid of   Just like we saw with U S  banks back in 2008  major European banks are busy trying to unload mountains of worthless assets that have a book value of trillions of euros  but virtually nobody wants to buy them  5 Government austerity programs are now being implemented all over Europe   But government austerity programs can have very negative economic effects   For example  we have already seen what government austerity has done to Greece  100 000 businesses have closed and a third of the population is now living in poverty But now governments all over Europe have decided that austerity is the way to go   The following comes from a recent article in the Economist         France s budget plans are close to being agreed on  further cuts are likely but will be delayed until after the elections in spring  Italy has yet to vote through a much revised package of cuts  Spain s incoming government has promised further spending cuts  especially in regional outlays  in order to meet deficit targets agreed with Brussels   6 The amount of debt owed by some of these European nations is so large that it is difficult to comprehend   For example  Greece  Portugal  Ireland  Italy and Spain owe the rest of the world about 3 trillion euros combined So what will massive government austerity do to troubled nations such as Spain  Portugal  Ireland and Italy   Ambrose Evans Pritchard is very concerned about what even more joblessness will mean for many of those countries         Even today  the jobless rate for youth is near 10pc in Japan  It is already 46pc in Spain  43pc in Greece  32pc in Ireland  and 27pc in Italy  We will discover over time what yet more debt deleveraging will do to these societies   7 Europe was able to bail out Greece and Ireland  but there is no way that Italy will be able to be rescued if they require a full blown bailout Unfortunately  Italy is in the midst of a massive financial meltdown as you read this   The yield on two year Italian bonds is now about double what it was for most of the summer   There is no way that is sustainable It would be hard to overstate how much of a crisis Italy represents   The following is how former hedge fund manager Bruce Krasting recently described the current situation        At this point there is zero possibility that Italy can refinance any portion of its  300b of 2012 maturing debt  If there is anyone at the table who still thinks that Italy can pull off a miracle  they are wrong  I m certain that the finance guys at the ECB and Italian CB understand this  I repeat  there is a zero chance for a market solution for Italy Krasting believes that either Italy gets a gigantic mountain of cash from somewhere or they will default within six months and that will mean the start of a global depression         I think the Italian story is make or break  Either this gets fixed or Italy defaults in less than six months  The default option is not really an option that policy makers would consider  If Italy can t make it  then there will be a very big crashing sound  It would end up taking out most of the global lenders  a fair number of countries would follow into Italy s vortex  In my opinion a default by Italy is certain to bring a global depression  one that would take many years to crawl out of   8 An Italian default may be closer than most people think   As the Telegraph recently reported  just to refinance existing debt  the Italian government must sell more than 30 billion euros worth of new bonds by the end of January         Italy s new government will have to sell more than EURO 30 billion of new bonds by the end of January to refinance its debts  Analysts say there is no guarantee that investors will buy all of those bonds  which could force Italy to default     The Italian government yesterday said that in talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy  Prime Minister Mario Monti had agreed that an Italian collapse  would inevitably be the end of the euro   9 European nations other than just the  PIIGS  are getting into an increasing amount of trouble   For example  S P recently slashed the credit rating of Belgium to AA  10 Credit downgrades are coming fast and furious all over Europe now   At this point it seems like we see a new downgrade almost every single week   Some nations have been downgraded several times   For instance  Fitch has downgraded the credit rating of Portugal again   At this point it is being projected that Portuguese GDP will shrink by about 3 percent in 2012  11 The financial collapse of Hungary didn t make many headlines in the United States  but it should have   Moody s has cut the credit rating of Hungarian debt to junk status  and Hungary has now submitted a formal request to the EU and the IMF for a bailout  12 Even faith in German debt seems to be wavering  Last week  Germany had  one of its worst bond auctions ever   13 German banks are also starting to show signs of weakness   The other day  Moody s downgraded the ratings of 10 major German banks  14 As the Telegraph recently reported  the British government is now making plans based on the assumption that a collapse of the euro is only  just a matter of time          As the Italian government struggled to borrow and Spain considered seeking an international bail out  British ministers privately warned that the break up of the euro  once almost unthinkable  is now increasingly plausible       Diplomats are preparing to help Britons abroad through a banking collapse and even riots arising from the debt crisis     The Treasury confirmed earlier this month that contingency planning for a collapse is now under way       A senior minister has now revealed the extent of the Government s concern  saying that Britain is now planning on the basis that a euro collapse is now just a matter of time   15 The EFSF was supposed to help bring some stability to the situation  but the truth is that the EFSF is already a bad joke   It has been reported that the EFSF has already been forced to buy up huge numbers of its own bonds  16 Unfortunately  it looks like a run on the banks has already begun in Europe   The following comes from a recent article in The Economist         We are starting to witness signs that corporates are withdrawing deposits from banks in Spain  Italy  France and Belgium   an analyst at Citi Group wrote in a recent report   This is a worrying development   17 Confidence in European banks has been absolutely shattered and virtually nobody wants to lend them money right now The following is a short excerpt from a recent CNBC article         Money market funds in the United States have quite dramatically slammed shut their lending windows to European banks  According to the Economist  Fitch estimates U S  money market funds have withdrawn 42 percent of their money from European banks in general     And for France that number is even higher   69 percent  European money market funds are also getting in on the act   18 There are dozens of major European banks that are in danger of failing   The reality is that most major European banks are leveraged to the hilt and are massively exposed to sovereign debt   Before it fell in 2008  Lehman Brothers was leveraged 31 to 1   Today  major German banks are leveraged 32 to 1  and those banks are currently holding a massive amount of European sovereign debt  19 According to the New York Times  the economy of the EU is already projected to shrink slightly next year  and this doesn t even take into account what is going to happen in the event of a total financial collapse  20 There are already signs that the European economy is seriously slowing down   Industrial orders in the eurozone declined by 6 4 percent during September   That was the largest decline that we have seen since the midst of the financial crisis in 2008  21 Panic and fear are everywhere in Europe right now   The European Commission s index of consumer confidence has declined for five months in a row  22 European leaders are really busy fighting with each other and a true consensus on how to solve the current problems seems way off at the moment   The following is how the Express recently described rising tensions between German and British leaders         The German Chancellor rejected outright Mr Cameron s opposition to a new EU wide financial tax that would have a devastating impact on the City of London     And she refused to be persuaded by his call for the European Central Bank to support the euro  Money markets took a dip after their failure to agree  Are you starting to get the picture The European financial system is in a massive amount of trouble  and when it melts down the entire globe is going to be shaken But it isn t just me that is saying this   As I mentioned in a previous article  there are huge numbers of respected economists all over the globe that are now saying that Europe is on the verge of collapse For example  just check out what Credit Suisse is saying about the situation in Europe         We seem to have entered the last days of the euro as we currently know it  That doesn t make a break up very likely  but it does mean some extraordinary things will almost certainly need to happen   probably by mid January   to prevent the progressive closure of all the euro zone sovereign bond markets  potentially accompanied by escalating runs on even the strongest banks  Many European leaders are promoting much deeper integration and a  European superstate  as the answer to these problems  but it would take years to implement changes that drastic  and Europe does not have that kind of time If Europe experiences a massive economic collapse and a prolonged depression  it may seem like  the end of the world  to some people  but things will eventually stabilize A lot of people out there seem to think that the global economy is going to go from its present state to  Mad Max  in a matter of weeks   Well  that is just not going to happen   The coming troubles in Europe will just be another  wave  in the ongoing economic collapse of the western world   There will be other  waves  after that Of course this current sovereign debt crisis could be entirely averted if the countries of the western world would just shut down their central banks and start issuing debt free money The truth is that there is no reason why any sovereign nation on earth ever has to go a penny into debt to anyone   If a nation is truly sovereign  then the government has the right to issue all of the debt free money that it wants   Yes  inflation would always be a potential danger in such a system  just as it is under central banking   but debt free money would mean that government debt problems would be a thing of the past Unfortunately  most of the countries of the world operate under a system where more government debt is created when more currency is created   The inevitable result of such a system is what we are witnessing now   At this point  nearly the entire western world is drowning in debt There are alternatives to our current system   But nobody in the mainstream media ever talks about them So instead of focusing on truly creative ways to deal with our current problems  we are all going to experience the bitter pain of the coming economic collapse instead Things did not have to turn out this way ,2011-11-29,Michael T.

96696,318211,PGR,Obama Gets Real,opinion,For most of his time as a national political figure  Barack Obama has been careful to cloak his core socialist leanings behind a veil of pro capitalist rhetoric  This makes strategic sense  as Americans still largely identify as pro capitalist  However  based on his recent speech in Osawatomie  Kansas  the President appears to have reassessed the political landscape in advance of the 2012 elections  Based on the growth of the Occupy Wall Street movement  and the recent defeat of Republicans in special elections  he has perhaps sensed a surge of left leaning sentiment  and  as a result  he finally dropped the pretense According to our President s new view of history  capitalism is a theory that has  never worked   He argues that its appeal can t be justified by results  but its popularity is based on Americans  preference for an economic ideology that  fits well on a bumper sticker   He feels that capitalism speaks to the flaws in the American DNA  those deeply rooted creation myths that elevate the achievements of individuals and cast unwarranted skepticism on the benefits of government  He argues that this pre disposition has been exploited by the rich to popularize policies that benefit themselves at the expense of the poor and middle class But Obama s knowledge of history is limited to what is written on his teleprompter  And his selection of the same location that Teddy Roosevelt used to chart an abrupt departure into populist politics is deeply symbolic in the opposite way to that which he intended  It is not by some genetic fluke that Americans distrust government  It is an integral and essential part of our heritage  The United States was founded by people who distrusted government intensely and was subsequently settled  over successive generations  by people fleeing the ravages of government oppression  These Americans relied on capitalism to quickly build the greatest economic power the world had ever seen   from nothing But according to Obama s revisionist version of American history  we tried capitalism only briefly during our history  First  during the Robber Barron period of the late 19th Century  the result of which was child labor and unprecedented lower class poverty  These ravages were supposedly only corrected by the progressive policies of Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson  We tried capitalism again in the 1920s  according to Obama  and the result was the Great Depression  This time  it allegedly took FDR s New Deal to finally slay that capitalist monster  Then  the account only gets more farcical  Apparently  we tried capitalism again under George W  Bush  and the result was the housing bubble  financial crisis  and ensuing Great Recession  Obama now argues that government is needed once again to save the day This view is complete fiction and proves that Obama is not qualified to teach elementary school civics  let alone serve as President of the United States  I wonder what other economic system he believes we followed prior to the 1890s and 1920s  and during the 1950s and 1960s  that that he now seeks to restore  Capitalism did not start with J P  Morgan in 1890s or John D  Rockefeller in the 1920s as the President suggests  In fact  it was about that time that capitalism came under attack by the progressives  We were born and prospered under capitalism  The Great Depression did not result from unbridled capitalism  but from the monetary policy of the newly created Federal Reserve and the interventionist economic policies of both Hoover and Roosevelt   policies that were decidedly un capitalist  The prosperity enjoyed during mid 20th century actually resulted from the incredible progress produced by years of capitalism  Contrary to Obama s belief  the New Deal and Great Society did not create the middle class  it was  in fact  a direct result of the capitalist industrial revolution  The socialist programs of which Obama is so fond are the reasons why the middle class has been shrinking  America s economic descent began in the 1960s  when we abandoned capitalism in favor of a mixed economy  By mixing capitalism with socialism  we undermined economic growth  and reversed much of the progress years of laissez faire had bestowed on average Americans  The back of the middle class is being broken by the weight of government and the enormous burden taxes and regulation place on the economy America s first experiment with socialism  the Plymouth Bay Colony  ended in failure  and our most successful colonies   New York  Virginia  Massachusetts    were begun primarily as commercial enterprises  When the founding fathers gathered to write the Constitution  they represented capitalist states and granted the federal government severely limited powers Apparently  Obama thinks our founders  mistrust of government was delusional  and that we were fortunate that far wiser groups of leaders eventually corrected those mistakes  The danger  as Obama sees it  is that some Republicans actually want to reverse course and adopt the failed ideas espoused by great American fools like George Washington  Thomas Jefferson  John Adams  and Benjamin Franklin The President unknowingly illustrated his own contradictory thinking with the importance he now places on extending the temporary payroll tax cuts  If all that stands between middle class families and abject poverty is a small tax cut  imagine how much damage the far more massive existing tax burden already inflicts on those very households  If Obama really wants to relieve middle class taxpayers of this burden  he needs to reduce the cost of government by cutting spending  After all  there is no way to pay for all the government programs Obama wants by simply by taxing the rich History has proven time and again that capitalism works and socialism does not  Taking money from the rich and redistributing it to the poor does not grow the economy  On the contrary  it reduces the incentives of both parties  It lowers savings  destroys capital  limits economic growth  and lowers living standards  Maybe Obama should take his eyes off the teleprompter long enough to read some American history  In fact  he could start by reading the Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold ,2011-12-12,Euro

96697,318212,PGR,The Collapse of the Euro  the Death of the Euro and the End of the Euro,opinion,The euro was a doomed project from the start  and now we are starting to see the endgame play out   Today  the euro fell to an 11 month low against the U S  dollar   As I write this  the EUR USD is at 1 2983   Back in July  the EUR USD was over 1 45   As panic has swept the financial markets  the euro has lost more than 3 percent over the past three days   But this is just the beginning   When the euro drops below 1 20  analysts will talk about the collapse of the euro   When the euro falls toward parity with the dollar  headlines around the world will scream about the death of the euro   But when the European financial system finally collapses  we may very well actually see the end of the euro   Yes  it actually could happen   The eurozone  as it is currently constructed  simply does not work   You just can t take 17 different nations that have 17 different fiscal policies  17 different tax policies and 17 different economic agendas and cram them all into a single currency and expect the thing to work   The euro is a doomed currency  and if a big nation like Germany decides to walk away at some point the game is going to be over It is not as if the euro is just having a bad week   Just check out this chart that shows what the euro has done relative to the U S  dollar over the past 6 months The truth is that a collapse of the euro has already begun And a whole lot of investors expect it to continue   Right now  huge amounts of money are being poured into bets that the euro is going to go even lower All over the world  financial professionals are speculating about how far the euro will eventually fall   Scott Mather  the head of global bond portfolio management at PIMCO  says that he believes that the euro is going to go much  much lower         Parity with the dollar next year is not out of the question Of course the central banks of the world could step in at some point with coordinated action to help support the value of the euro   This kind of thing has happened before   But such support would only be temporary Central banks can manipulate the markets for a while  but in the end the long term trends are going to prevail   Just look at what is happening with European bond yields European bond yields are rising once again even though the European Central Bank has already spent over 274 billion dollars buying up European government bonds There will be more efforts to try to prevent the death of the euro  but those efforts will be kind of like spitting into the wind A recent article posted on Crackerjack Finance talked about some of the fundamental problems that make the euro such a flawed currency        The problems of the Eurozone s flawed construct are now completely exposed  A block of 17 sovereign nations have adopted a common currency and outsourced monetary policy to a common central bank  Yet each of the 17 sovereign nations have different comparative advantages  industries  debt levels  interest rates  budget deficits  labor market rules  and tax policies  Reflecting on all the differences  it is amazing that the Eurozone has survived in the current construct for over a decade Greece would probably not be going through an economic depression right now if they had not joined the euro   But now  100 000 businesses have closed since the beginning of the recent crisis and a third of the country is living in poverty As this crisis spreads throughout the rest of Europe  it is going to put an incredible amount of stress on the European financial system   Many now believe that the euro may not be able to make it through the tough times that are ahead The following comes from a report recently produced by Credit Suisse s Fixed Income Research unit         We seem to have entered the last days of the euro as we currently know it  That doesn t make a break up very likely  but it does mean some extraordinary things will almost certainly need to happen   probably by mid January   to prevent the progressive closure of all the euro zone sovereign bond markets  potentially accompanied by escalating runs on even the strongest banks  So will we actually see the end of the euro Only time will tell But one thing is for sure   the situation in Europe is rapidly getting worse In Greece  approximately 20 percent of all bank deposits have been withdrawn since the start of 2011 If you still have money in a Greek bank  you might want to do something about it before the run on the banks gets even worse In fact  if you still have money in any European bank  you might want to consider your options Today it was revealed that Germany s second largest bank is going to need a bailout The following comes from a Sky News report        Germany s second largest bank  Commerzbank  is reportedly in discussions with the German government about a bailout after regulators said it needed to raise more money to cope with a potential default on its loans to governments      Intense talks  have been going on for several days  according to sources who spoke to the news agency Reuters Let the bailouts begin European governments are going to save the banks that they want to save  and the rest they are going to let fail So who will live and who will die We just don t know But without a doubt  a whole lot of European banks are in trouble   In fact  Fitch Ratings downgraded the credit ratings of five more major European banks on Wednesday The eurozone worked well for a while  but now the flaws in the system are becoming appallingly evident   To get an idea of just how badly the European financial system is unraveling  just check out this chart   European bond yields are not supposed to be acting like that In the end  someone is going to leave the euro   There has been a lot of talk about Greece or Italy leaving the euro  but the truth is that it is probably more likely that a strong nation such as Germany will be the first to make a move If Germany leaves the euro  will they start printing up new German currency No  I believe in that case that Germany would seek to establish an entirely new European currency for an entirely new European financial system   Germany is very committed to the idea of a  European superstate   and just because the euro is a failure does not mean that they are ready to give up on the idea But time will tell who is right and who is wrong For much more on why we are on the verge of a massive financial collapse in Europe  please check out these articles      Mega Fail  17 Signs That The European Financial System Is Heading For An Implosion Of Historic Proportions   22 Reasons Why We Could See An Economic Collapse In Europe In 2012 As I have written about previously  it doesn t take a genius to figure out what is happening in Europe   The equation is simple    Brutal austerity   toxic levels of government debt   rising bond yields   a lack of confidence in the financial system   banks that are massively overleveraged   a massive credit crunch   A financial implosion of historic proportionsUnfortunately  the United States is not going to escape all of this chaos unscathed either The financial systems of the United States and Europe are more deeply tied together than ever before   When the financial crisis in Europe fully erupts  we are going to see lots of banks in the United States fail too The U S  economy never recovered from the financial crisis of 2008  and this next financial crisis could send us into a huge tailspin 2012 is going to be a very interesting year for the financial world   I hope that you all are ready for what is about to happen ,2011-12-15,Michael T.

96698,318213,PGR,A Very Scary Christmas And An Incredibly Frightening New Year,opinion,Can you hear that   It almost sounds like a little bit of peace and quiet   This year  the holiday season has been fairly uneventful  and for that we should be very grateful   But it isn t going to last long   2012 is going to be a much more difficult year for the U S  economy and the global financial system than 2011 has been   So if things are going well for you right now  enjoy this little bubble of peace and tranquility while you can   Because while things may look calm on the surface right now  the truth is that this is a very scary Christmas for financial professionals and world leaders   Most of them know how fragile the global financial system is at the moment   Most of them know that we are living in the greatest bubble of debt  leverage and financial risk that the world has ever seen   As I wrote about the other day  world leaders would not be throwing huge bailouts around like crazy if everything was going to be just fine   The truth is that we are rapidly approaching another financial crisis that may end up being even worse than the horrific crash of 2008 Despite unprecedented efforts by the European Central Bank  the yield on 10 year Italian bonds is nearly up to 7 percent again Keep an eye on the yield on 10 year Italian bonds   That is going to be one of the most important financial numbers in the world in the coming months But Italy is not the only problem   The reality is that several European governments are teetering on the verge of default right now   Meanwhile  confidence in the European financial system has been absolutely shattered and a devastating credit crunch has set in   Nobody  other than the ECB  wants to loan money to the banks and the banks are massively cutting back on loans to businesses and consumers   This is causing the money supply to fall   The ECB is trying to hold things together with chicken wire and duct tape  but it isn t going to work In major financial centers such as the City of London  this is a very scary Christmas and the outlook for the new year looks very frightening   Because financial activity has dried up so dramatically  a number of firms are already shutting down   The following comes from a recent Bloomberg article        London s stockbrokers are shrinking as Europe s sovereign debt crisis and competition from international firms squeezes revenue and fees      This isn t just a blip  this is much worse   said Tim Linacre  who is stepping down as chief executive officer of Panmure  PMR  Gordon   Co   a 135 year old brokerage   It s a desert for activity  which is why you are seeing some firms throw in the towel      In the past month  Altium Capital closed its securities unit  Evolution Group Plc  EVG   Merchant Securities Group Plc  Arbuthnot Securities Ltd  and Collins Stewart Hawkpoint Plc have all accepted takeover offers from larger competitors      It feels worse than any other time   said Lorna Tilbian  an executive director at Numis Corp  who began her career in 1984   All I hear about is people putting up a white flag  Many out there are wondering if we are about to face another crisis like the one we saw back in 2008 Unfortunately  none of the underlying problems that caused that crisis were ever really fixed We did not learn from history so now we are in for another round of pain In fact  Chris Martenson believes that this next crisis will be even worse than 2008        There are clear signs of a liquidity crunch in the asset markets right now  and the question I keep hearing is  Is this 2008 all over again     No  it s worse  Much worse     In 2008 there was a lot more faith and optimism upon which to draw  But both have been squandered to significant degrees by feckless regulators and authorities who failed to properly address any of the root causes of the first crisis even as they slathered layer after layer of thin air money over many of the symptoms     Anyone who has paid attention knows that those  magic potions  proved to be anything but  Not only are the root causes still with us  too much debt  vast regional financial imbalances  and high energy prices   but they have actually grown worse the entire time Frightening stuff A couple of months ago  I wrote about the coming derivatives crisis that could potentially wipe out the entire global financial system When the next great financial crisis strikes  there is going to be a lot of focus on derivatives once again Top global financial authorities such as Ben Bernanke continue to insist that derivatives are perfectly safe But there are other voices in the financial world that are warning that we are heading for financial armageddon   For example just check out what Mark Faber is saying         I am convinced the whole derivatives market will cease to exit  Will become zero  And when it happens I don t know  you can postpone the problems with monetary measures for a long time but you can t solve them    Greece should have defaulted   it would have sent a message that not all derivatives are equal because it depends on the counterparty  That is very strong language Faber also believes that the stock market is going to get hit really  really hard during the coming crisis         I am ultra bearish  I think most people will be lucky if they still have 50  of their money in 5 years time  You have to have diversification   some real estate in the countryside  some gold and some equities because if you think it through  say Germany 1900 to today  we had WWI  we had hyperinflation  WWII  cash holders and bondholders they lost everything 3 times  but if you owned equities you d be ok  In equities in general you will not lose it all  it may not be a good investment  unless you put it all in one company and it goes bankrupt  Some of the top financial officials in the entire world have also used some very scary language in recent weeks The head of the International Monetary Fund  Christian Lagarde  recently stated that we could soon see conditions  reminiscent of the 1930s depression  and that no country on earth  will be immune to the crisis          There is no economy in the world  whether low income countries  emerging markets  middle income countries or super advanced economies that will be immune to the crisis that we see not only unfolding but escalating But most people are so busy opening up the cheap plastic presents under their Christmas trees  that were mostly made overseas  that they aren t even paying attention to these warnings Look  when the money supply falls significantly it is almost impossible to avoid a recession   Just look at the historical numbers Unfortunately  money supply numbers all over Europe are falling dramatically right now as an article in the Telegraph recently noted        All key measures of the money supply in the eurozone contracted in October with drastic falls across parts of southern Europe  raising the risk of severe recession over coming months Confidence in the banking system in Europe has never been this low in the post World War II era   Sadly  most people simply do not understand how bad things have gotten for major European banks   One Australian news source recently put it this way         If anyone thinks things are getting better  they simply don t understand how severe the problems are   a London executive at a global bank said   A major bank could fail within weeks      Others said many continental banks  including French  Italian and Spanish lenders  were close to running out of the acceptable forms of collateral  such as US Treasury bonds  that could be used to finance short term loans     Some have been forced to lend out their gold reserves to maintain access to US dollar funding The outlook is very ominous Financial professionals all over the globe are telling us what is coming if we are willing to listen The following comes from a report recently produced by Credit Suisse s Fixed Income Research unit         We seem to have entered the last days of the euro as we currently know it  That doesn t make a break up very likely  but it does mean some extraordinary things will almost certainly need to happen   probably by mid January   to prevent the progressive closure of all the euro zone sovereign bond markets  potentially accompanied by escalating runs on even the strongest banks  The first six months of 2012 are going to be a very key time   National governments and big European banks are scheduled to roll over huge mountains of debt   But if they can t find any takers that could bring the global financial system to a moment of great crisis very quickly The following is how former hedge fund manager Bruce Krasting recently described the problem that Italy is facing        At this point there is zero possibility that Italy can refinance any portion of its  300b of 2012 maturing debt  If there is anyone at the table who still thinks that Italy can pull off a miracle  they are wrong  I m certain that the finance guys at the ECB and Italian CB understand this  I repeat  there is a zero chance for a market solution for Italy But even if we don t see a formal default by a major European nation such a Italy  that doesn t mean that major European banks are going to make it through the crippling recession that has now begun in Europe Charles Wyplosz  a professor of international economics at Geneva s Graduate Institute  is absolutely convinced that we are going to see some major European banks collapse         Banks will collapse  including possibly a number of French banks that are very exposed to Greece  Portugal  Italy and Spain  Authorities in Europe are saying the  right things  publicly  but privately they are preparing for the worst As the Telegraph recently reported  the British government is now making plans based on the assumption that a collapse of the euro is only  just a matter of time         A senior minister has now revealed the extent of the Government s concern  saying that Britain is now planning on the basis that a euro collapse is now just a matter of time Yes  we are heading for a huge financial collapse and massive economic trouble So enjoy the good times while we still have them They are not going to last too much longer
