179463,400979,TXT,Textron Tempers Expectations for 2020,news,"Textron  NYSE TXT  came into earnings season in need of a catalyst to get investors excited about holding its shares  Fourth quarter results did come in slightly ahead of expectations  but the company s tepid outlook for 2020 provided little reason for excitement 
Shares of Textron have underperformed the market by more than 33 percentage points over the last year  as the stock has been hit by a series of issues spread across the industrial conglomerate s vast portfolio 

TXT vs  S P 500 data by YCharts 
There s still a lot to like about that portfolio  and potential upside if some of the headwinds Textron expects to face in 2020 subside  But increasingly  it appears investors will have to look to 2021 for a full recovery 
Here s a look at Textron s most recent results    and at what the company expects in the quarters to come 
Earnings beat  but margins were down
On Jan  29  Textron reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings of  1 11 per share on revenue of  4 04 billion  beating consensus expectations for  1 09 per share in earnings on sales of  3 95 billion  The results were boosted by 11  growth in aviation revenue and 16  revenue growth from helicopter maker Bell 
 Textron Aviation saw double digit revenue growth in the quarter driven largely by initial deliveries of our new Citation Longitude  reflecting our continued investment in new products   chairman and CEO Scott C  Donnelly said in a statement   We also saw growth from strong commercial volume at Bell  
Aviation delivered 71 jets in the quarter  up from 63 in the last three months of 2018  Bell delivered 76 commercial helicopters  up from 46 a year prior  However  profit fell year over year at three of Textron s four segments 

Data source  Textron earnings report 
Textron blamed the mix of products sold and  an unfavorable impact from inflation  net of pricing  for the profit fall at aviation  As Donnelly notes  the company s new Longitude business jet is entering service  which led to higher costs including rework for modifications mandated for it to receive final certification  Similarly  lower volumes of specialty vehicles hit the bottom line at the company s industrial unit 
In December  Textron announced a plan to bring down costs  including headcount reductions in aviation as an extended period of new product development comes to an end  Textron took the actions in part due to expected declining demand for some of its legacy aircraft platforms  but the move was also a signal that it sees a lull in new product development spending 
Where s the growth 
The question for Textron continues to be  where is the growth going to come from  The company said it expects 2020 revenue of about  14 billion  a modest increase over  13 6 billion in 2019 and barely above the  13 97 billion in revenue recorded in 2018  Textron expects full year earnings of  3 50 to  3 70 per share in 2020  compared to the  3 50 it posted in 2019  Going into the results  analysts were expecting  3 73 per share in earnings this year 
The forecast is somewhat backloaded into the second half of 2020 in part due to ramifications of a late December liquid nitrogen explosion at a Textron plant in Kansas  The incident caused significant damage to Textron s composite manufacturing operations  which the company expects will disrupt production and slow aircraft delivery during the first half of the year 
Textron also faces uncertainty in its Kautex automotive operations  which has a number of plants in China that could be affected for an unknown amount of time by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak  Textron considered selling Kautex last year  but it backed off after exploring options 
The company s Bell unit posted an impressive 2 4 times book to bill at year s end  and Bell looks well positioned to compete for a pair of multibillion dollar helicopter competitions for the U S  Army  The Pentagon is expected to select final combatants for the contracts as soon as the current quarter  and while Bell wouldn t generate substantial revenue prior to a final award being issued  staying in the competition would create new opportunities heading into 2021 
Bell  like the business jet unit  is nearing the end of a period of extensive R D spending to bring new military and commercial platforms to market  and it should be able to drive margins higher in the quarters to come 
Something has to give
Textron is in a multiyear period where results have been somewhat flat  which has led to the stock underperforming  The company has high hopes for aviation and Bell for the second half of this year and heading into 2021  but investors have been hearing talk like that for a while now 
If results stay stagnant as 2020 goes on  I would not be surprised to see an activist push for some sort of a dramatic action to get Textron moving  That could come in the form of a large acquisition    there has been talk of the company buying the business jet business of Bombardier    or a call to break up the company or sell some or all of the company s aerospace operations to a larger defense company  It could try again to sell Kautex if the auto industry returns to growth 
On a post earnings call  Textron CEO Scott C  Donnelly declined comment on M A activity  but it s clear he believes that after a period of heavy spending on R D to get new products ready for launch  the company is nearing a windfall where military and commercial helicopters and business jet sales will surge higher 
There are a lot of strong pieces in this portfolio as well as reasons to be optimistic about Textron  However  it seems it s going to require that investors stay patient for at least a couple more quarters ",2020-02-01,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppuha,2073752

179466,400982,TXT,Why Shares of Textron Are Higher Today,news,"What happened
Shares of Textron  NYSE TXT  traded up more than 8  on Tuesday after reports surfaced that the company is in talks to acquire the business jet division of Bombardier  OTC BDRBF   The talks are ongoing and might not result in a deal  but it would make sense for both parties and give Textron a much needed shot in the arm 
So what
Shares of Textron  an industrial conglomerate that already owns the Cessna  Beechcraft  and Hawker aviation brands  have been stuck in a rut over the past year  weighed down by a lack of growth and issues spread across the portfolio  Investors increasingly have been calling for the company to make a move to jump start growth  Combining its aviation business with the Bombardier assets would offer cost cutting and revenue growth opportunities 

Just last week  I suggested that an acquisition of the Bombardier business was a possible way to spark growth by giving the combination greater market share  increasing the total fleet of aircraft in operation  and adding potential maintenance and spare parts customers 
Bombardier has been selling assets to raise money to pay down its debt  shedding its commercial aircraft programs to Airbus and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and its aerostructures business to Spirit AeroSystems  The company is reportedly exploring selling its business jet division to raise cash to pay down some of its  9 billion in debt

Now what
The deal would be a step in the right direction for Textron  but it is no quick fix  With or without Bombardier  Textron investors will likely need to wait until at least 2021 to see growth kick in 
There is reason for optimism about Textron even without a deal  since the company is in a good position to increase its presence in the defense sector via a pair of multibillion dollar helicopter competitions for the U S  Army  It is also forecasting an uptick in business jet sales in the second half of 2020  with that segment weighed down temporarily by a late December liquid nitrogen explosion at a plant in Kansas

179479,400995,TXT,Textron s Autonomous Helicopter Replacement Takes Flight,news,"In the two years since its first flight  Textron s  NYSE TXT  V 280 tiltrotor prototype has turned heads with its ability to reach airplane like speeds while maintaining helicopter like maneuverability  In late December  the company unveiled a new feature sure to go over well with military buyers  demonstrating the V 280 s ability to fly itself 
We re likely more than a decade away from the U S  military using autonomous troop transports and attack helicopters  but the V 280 s demonstration is an exciting glimpse into the future  and a sign of things to come  It could also boost Textron s chances of winning billions in procurements in the coming years  as the U S  Army seeks to replace its aging helicopter fleet 
Look Congresswoman  no hands 
This week Textron told reporters that the V 280 flew autonomously during a December demonstration at the company s Bell Helicopter Texas facility  The test was limited to specific maneuvers  including an autonomous takeoff  landing  loitering over a spot  and precision navigation to specific waypoints  
Pilots were in the cockpit during the maneuvers  and intervened between different autonomous elements and performed more complex demonstrations 
There are no future autonomous test flights scheduled  but Textron seemingly accomplished its primary goal from the demonstration  proving its tech credentials in front of an audience that included Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and Congresswoman Kay Granger of Texas 

Textron  though often overlooked as a defense stock  has long been one of the military s top suppliers of drones  The company is also developing an autonomous air taxi for commercial use 
Because the V 280 s controls are entirely electronic  autonomous flying requires only modifying software written for other applications  and not physical changes to the cockpit 
The V 280 was designed and built for the Army s Joint Multi Role Technology Demonstration  JMR  program  a first step in the Pentagon s effort to modernize its helicopter fleet and to introduce new technologies 
The V 280 first flew in December 2017  and has since logged more than 160 flight hours  The tilt design is intended to give the V 280 airplane like speed and range  while allowing it to still perform helicopter maneuvers  including landing and taking off without a runway and hovering over tight spaces 
The payoff is on the horizon
The demonstration program is winding down  but the V 280  or at least an aircraft based on its design  is expected to be Textron s submission in the Army s upcoming Future Long Range Assault Aircraft  FLRAA  program 
The Army hopes to develop and field the FLRAA  which would replace its classic UH 60 Black Hawk  as well as a separate Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft  FARA   to replace the AH 64 Apache 
Textron and the V 280 have significant competition  Lockheed Martin and Boeing were also involved in the JMR program  with the two jointly submitting a futuristic helicopter with two main rotors and a rear mounted pusher propulsor  which the companies say can better duplicate helicopter functions while matching the V 280 s speed  The coaxial design  with rotors spinning in opposite directions  is closely regulated by software and the aircraft  called the Defiant  was delayed multiple times  but finally took flight last year 
There are likely to be multiple winners of contracts to support Army helicopter modernization  and substantial dollars to be won 
The Congressional Budget Office last year estimated the U S  Army will spend about  1 5 billion annually  in 2018 dollars  by 2027 on helicopter replacement  with that figure then rising to a peak of about  4 7 billion in 2032 and drifting slowly downward through the middle part of the century  
It s hard to handicap a competition before it even begins  But assuming both aircraft continue to fly to spec  it appears the Defiant is the favorite to replace the Apache  and the V 280 a better fit for taking over the Black Hawk s traditional role of transporting troops and cargo and flying long range missions 
Textron could use the lift
Textron  an industrial conglomerate with businesses ranging from aerospace to golf carts  has been an underperformer  with its shares trailing the S P 500 by more than 30 percentage points in 2019  and by more than 50 percentage points over the past three years 
There have been a range of culprits at various points in time  including sluggish sales at its business jet unit and issues integrating a snowmobile acquisition  But the easiest  most straightforward way for Textron to reverse the negative quarterly trends and get back on track is via increasing sales to the Pentagon 

TXT vs  S P 500 data by YCharts
Bell Helicopter is a pivotal part of that plan  The V 280 arguably outperformed the Defiant during the JMR demonstration  or at the very least by getting airborne had significantly more flight and demonstration time  Autonomous flying  even in its early stages  is another feather in the aircraft s cap 
Given the expedited timeline  the Army is unlikely to require the FARA or FLRAA to be ready to fly autonomously from the start  However  pilotless flying is a long term goal 
As Textron demonstrated in December in front of a VIP audience  it is well on its way toward hitting that goal ",2020-01-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ph1y7,2057593

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorLadies and gentlemen  thank you standing by and welcome to the Textron Earnings Call  At this time  all participants are in a listen only mode   Operator Instructions  As a reminder  today s call is being recorded I will now turn the call over to your host  Vice President  Investor Relations  Eric Salander  Please go ahead  sir Eric Salander    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks Kevin and good morning everyone  Before we begin  I d like to mention  we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today  These forward looking statements are subject to various risk factors  which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today s press release  On the call today we have Scott Donnelly  Textron s Chairman and CEO  and Frank Connor  our Chief Financial Officer Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website Textron s revenues in the quarter were  4 billion  up  285 million from last year  During this year s fourth quarter  we recorded  72 million in pre tax special charges  largely related to Industrial and Textron Aviation or  0 24 per share after tax  Excluding these special charges  adjusted net income was  1 11 per share compared to  1 15 in last year s fourth quarter  Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was  650 million  up  366 million from last year s fourth quarter  For the full year  revenues were  13 6 billion  down 2  from a year ago  Adjusted net income was  3 74 per share compared to  3 34 last year  Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions  was  642 million  down from  784 million last year With that  I will turn the call over to Scott Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Eric and good morning everybody  Revenues were higher in the fourth quarter  primarily driven by double digit growth at Textron Aviation  Bell and Textron Systems  The Bell revenues were up  largely due to higher commercial deliveries of our 407  429 and 505 models We delivered 76 commercial helicopters  up from 46 in last year s fourth quarter  On the military side  the V 22 tiltrotor recently surpassed the milestone of 500 000 flight hours  With more than 375 V 22 aircraft in operation across the U S  Marine Corps  Air Force  and Navy as well as internationally with Japan  this increasingly large installed base continues to drive significant aftermarket opportunities  to support this highly utilized fleet In the fourth quarter  the Bell Boeing program office was awarded contracts totaling over  800 million across multiple support activities  including  375 million to provide maintenance  repair and consumable material support to the U S  Navy  Air Force and Marine Corp operations   218 million for logistics and engineering support for aircraft across U S  military fleet   146 million  as part of the Marine Corps CCRAM modernization program  and  68 million for logistics and engineering support to Japan Bell also received an  815 million five year performance based logistics contract for the U S  Navy for upgrades to their H1 Yankee and Zulu aircraft On the new product front  Bell marked their second anniversary of V 280 s first flight in December  In two years of highly successful flight demonstrations  the aircraft has flown  more than 160 hours to collect data and informed requirements for the U S  Army s future long range assault aircraft program In December  the V 280 autonomously for the first time  meaning all of Bell s demonstration flight goals  including automated take off and landing  conversion to cruise mode and precision navigation At Systems  revenues were up on higher volume  largely within our unmanned systems product line  In the quarter  Textron Marine   Land Systems announced that its Ship to Shore Connector craft 100  successfully completed acceptance trials with the U S  Navy  Also in the quarter  Textron Systems ATAC was selected as an authorized provider of contracted air adversary services for the U S  Air Force  Combat Air Force s Contracted Air Support program  ATAC has also started flying its Mirage F1 fighters  in support of their current U S  Navy contract Early in January  the U S  Army announced its intention to award Textron Systems a contract for four Repsol M5 vehicles  as part of its robotic combat vehicle medium program Moving to Industrial  we recently completed our previously announced review of strategic alternatives for our Kautex business unit  The review considered a range of options for the business and after careful consideration  we determined that the interest of our shareholders are best served with Kautex remaining as part of Textron At Textron Specialized Vehicles  we added additional independent dealers to our new TRACKER distribution channel and saw continued retail volume growth in the quarter Moving to Textron Aviation in the quarter  revenues were  1 7 billion  up 11   We delivered 71 jets  up from 63 last year and 59 commercial turboprops  down from 67 in last year s fourth quarter  We also initiated deliveries of the new Citation Longitude with 13 aircraft in the quarter  including the first aircraft delivered to NetJets I would now like to update you on the December 27 accident at our Wichita plant 3 facility  First and foremost  our number one priority is the health and safety of our employees  and we re fortunate that all 12 injured employees have been released from the hospital and are recovering  From an operational standpoint  Cessna SkyCourier located also in plant 3 has been unaffected by the accident  and that program is continuing on schedule  Just last month  we accomplished a successful wing mate of the SkyCourier  a key milestone in the development of this new twin utility turboprop  The plant did incur significant damage  affecting our composite manufacturing operations  and we are working to recover the entire facility  We do expect some disruptions to our production  that will impact our ability to complete and deliver aircraft in the first half of 2020  But we fully expect to recover by year end  with no impact to our annual plan In December  we announced a restructuring plan to reduce costs and improve overall operating efficiencies  through headcount reductions and other actions  At Aviation  these actions largely included headcount reductions  reflecting the completion of a long period of new product development  resulting in the entering of service of the Citation Latitude  and most recently the Citation Longitude  These actions were necessary to align our cost structure within the current operating environment  as we ramp up production of Longitude  anticipate lower legacy aircraft demand and reduced requirements for ongoing development programs We also acquired Premier Aviation with its three locations in Australia  which has expanded our reach of aftermarket services in the Asia Pacific region  reflecting our continued investment to support our customers internationally  Then in the Aviation aftermarket  increased volumes drove higher aftermarket revenues  which were up over 13  from the prior year In summary  we had many items to highlight in 2019 across our segments  At Bell  we continue the successful flight testing of V 280 Valor  achieving a cruise speed of over 300 knots  improve the aircraft maneuverability and  Indecipherable  to the Army s high standards for aircraft agility  We also unveiled the Bell 360 Invictus  our offering for the U S  Army s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft competition On Bell s commercial business  we saw higher deliveries from increased order demand we ve seen over the last year and half  At Textron Systems  we had wins on several key development programs  including the Repsol M5 selected for the Army s robotic Combat Vehicle program  Aerosonde HQ  selected for phase one of the Army s Future Tactical UAS program  ATAC selected to participate in the Air Force CAF CAS program  and we were down selected to continue in the Army s next generation squad weapons program Within TSV  we launched a new distribution channel  through our partnership with Bass Pro Shops and Cabela s  and independent TRACKER Marine dealers  We also implemented a new business model to better align production with demand in our stow business and we expect both actions to drive both growth and improved performance in the outdoor power sports business At Textron Aviation  we certified and began deliveries of our newest Citation  Longitude  and advanced development of two new turboprop programs  the Cessna SkyCourier and Denali  With this backdrop  we re projecting revenues of about  14 billion for Textron s 2020 financial guidance  At Bell  we re expecting continued strong execution in 2020  The lower military production  offset by higher military aftermarket and higher commercial volumes At Systems  we are expecting modest revenue growth  partially driven by the 2019 new program wins highlighted earlier  At Industrial  we will maintain our focus on our vehicle business in 2020  as we continue to improve execution and drive improved profitability At Aviation  we are projecting growth from increased deliveries of our new Citation Longitude aircraft  partially offset by lower legacy demand  We are projecting EPS in the range of  3 50 to  3 70 per share  Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of  700 million to  800 million With that  I will turn the call over to Frank Frank T  Connor    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Scott  and good morning everyone  Segment profit in the quarter was  340 million  down  57 million from the fourth quarter of 2018 on a  285 million increase in revenues Let s review how each of the segments contributed  starting with Textron Aviation  Revenues at Textron Aviation of  1 7 billion were up 11   primarily due to higher volume and mix  largely reflecting the Longitude s entry into service  Segment profit was  134 million in the fourth quarter  down from  170 million a year ago  primarily due to the mix of products sold and an unfavorable impact from inflation net of pricing  The resulting margin dilution in the quarter from the mix of aircrafts sold  was largely due to the initial Longitude deliveries  and the associated higher cost basis  that included rework for modifications required by the final Type Certification and lower legacy deliveries  Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at  1 7 billion Moving to Bell  revenues were  961 million  up 16  from  827 million last year  primarily on higher commercial volume  Segment profit of  118 million was up  10 million  largely on the higher commercial volume  Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at  6 9 billion  At Textron Systems  revenues were  399 million  up 16  from  345 million a year ago  primarily due to higher volume  Segment profit of  33 million was down  4 million  primarily due to unfavorable performance  partially offset by the higher volume and mix  Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at  1 2 billion Industrial revenues of  927 million decreased  81 million  largely related to lower volume and mix at Textron Specialized Vehicles  principally due to the shift in the timing of snow sales to the third quarter of 2019  reflecting the new business model that was implemented earlier this year  Segment profit was  44 million  compared to  73 million a year ago  largely due to volume at Kautex    lower volume at Kautex  and the shift in volume at TSV  partially offset by favorable performance in price at TSV Finance segment revenues increased  1 million and profit increased  2 million Moving below segment profit  corporate expenses were  22 million and interest expense was  36 million  With respect to our restructuring plan  we recorded pre tax special charges of  72 million in the quarter  We ended the year with manufacturing debt of  3 1 billion  For the full year  we repurchased approximately 10 million shares at an overall cost of  503 million Turning now to our out 2020 outlook  I ll begin with our segments on slide 9 of the earnings call presentation  At Textron Aviation  we re expecting higher revenues of about  5 4 billion  reflecting higher Longitude deliveries  partially offset by lower legacy deliveries  Segment margin is expected to be approximately 8   reflecting the dilution related to higher inventory costs and learning curve associated with the increased Longitude deliveries  and lower legacy volume Looking to Bell  we expect overall revenues of about  3 3 billion  We re forecasting a margin of about 12 5   largely reflecting a change in mix of military volume  At Systems  we are estimating higher 2020 revenues of about  1 5 billion  segment margin is expected to be about 10 5   At Industrial  we re expecting segment revenues of about  3 8 billion and a margin of about 6 5   At Finance  we are forecasting segment profit of about  20 million Turning to slide 10  we re estimating 2020 pension costs to be about  33 million versus pension income of  11 million last year  Turning to slide 11  R D is expected to be about  550 million  down from  647 million in 2019  We re estimating capex will be about  360 million  up from  339 million last year Moving below the segment line and looking at slide 12  we re projecting about  135 million of corporate expense   135 million of interest expense and a full year effective tax rate of approximately 18 5   Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 227 million shares  as we continue to deploy the majority of our free cash flow toward share repurchases in 2020 That concludes our prepared remarks  So Kevin  we can open the line for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions   First question in queue is from the line of Peter Arment

ramping and finally getting across the goal line  that s a big step forward  But just kind of I see the legacy rates coming down  What s kind of    is there an expectation on kind of unit volume you expect for 2020 Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI think overall  unit volume will be fairly flat  Peter  So it s from    on a unit number  we ll have clearly more a lot more Longitude  So the revenue guide is obviously up  But as I said  the unit volumes would be kind of flattish  although those  Phonetic  have higher unit revenues driven by the fact  that we will have a significant mix of Longitudes Peter Arment    Robert W  Baird    AnalystOkay  And then just on the Longitude itself  there was expectation that this was going to help a lot on the factory absorption side  Is there just a point in time or an inflection  where we get through kind of the learning curves  what s your expectations around that Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  clearly what we have  The first quarter    first in the    really most of the first half  we will be selling all the aircraft that we were fabricating late last year  Obviously  a number of those have a lot of the rework that was basically inventoried and we ll deliver here  particularly in the first quarter  The learning curve is going well  but for sure  we will expect to see a more normalized margin rate on Longitude  as you get into the back half of the year  So that s the challenge in terms of the mix  sizes  Phonetic  are going through sort of moving the aircraft that has incurred a fair bit of rework  so say  the certification process and then getting the learning curve under our belt  which we feel good about  in terms of the early fabs in all the feeder lines that are coming into final  But we ll really start to see those aircraft that we are going to deliver in the second half of the year  hitting the final assembly line here  as we get into the first half Peter Arment    Robert W  Baird    AnalystAnd just lastly on just overall demand in biz jets  just what s your current take and we ve been    obviously you ve been  had some fits and starts with the trade and kind of the stresses last year  Can you maybe give us your overall environment Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think it s pretty consistent with what we talked about going into the third quarter  The Longitude obviously being a brand new product and very well received in the market  we feel good about how that s going and clearly a new product like that will drive some demand activity  which is great On the legacy side  things continue to be sort of flattish to down  and as we ve talked about in the third quarter  our approach here is that we would lower our volumes  bring back some of our production capacity and make sure that we don t have to get to a situation where we ve got a bunch of excess aircraft and start to drive pricing activity So I think we re    we made those adjustments going into the fourth quarter and I think we ll hold those for our perspective    at this point  we ll hold that through 2020  If something starts to change or we see things strengthen  there s certainly a lot of conversation  Peter  it s not like the market s not out there  but getting people to commit has been a little bit softer and we saw that through the whole back half of of 2019  So I think the market has been pretty stable here for the last three  six months Peter Arment    Robert W  Baird    AnalystAppreciate all the color  Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kay of Jefferies  Please go ahead Sheila Kahyaoglu    Jefferies    AnalystHey  good morning guys  I am dropping my last name Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI see that Sheila Kahyaoglu    Jefferies    AnalystI just wanted to follow up quickly on Peter s question  You had 7 8  margins in the fourth quarter  13 Longitudes out the door  So when we think about the quarterly Aviation margin cadence  does it dip below that in the first half and also putting the incident in plant 3 into the picture too  So is this the kind of    do we expect a steeper drop in the first half Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So look  I mean we don t normally go into quarterly kind of progression  but considering  particularly with the impact of plant 3  I think that we will probably be somewhere in the 10 to 15 aircraft in Q1 and Q2  We are still in the process of finalizing and understanding all the tooling  which everything appears to be repairable  But it will take some time to get the composite operation back up and running So given that and the progression we just talked about  with Peter on the margin  kind of going from tougher marginal Longitudes and becoming more normalized  as we get  sort of exiting 2020  I think the progression at Aviation is going to start the year  sort of low single digit in Q1  It s going to move to a mid single digit in Q2  and then high single digit Q3 and double digit Q4  Again  that s really    normally we don t kind of go in that level of detail  but I think we have to make sure people understand that we are going to have lighter deliveries in Q1 and Q2  driven by the composite factory issue  and that compounded with the change of margin rate of Longitudes through the course of the year  will give us that sort of progression So its again a full year sort of intact  and I think consistent with the guide that we have given you  but we clearly expect that Q3  Q4 are going to be at the more normalized margin rates that we expect out of this business  But it will be light in Q1  Q2  given the Longitude mix and the late deliveries frankly  of a lot of the legacy aircraft impacted by the plant 3 situation Sheila Kahyaoglu    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  thanks  That s pretty clear  And sorry for all that detail on the quarter  But bigger picture question  you decided to keep Kautex  I guess  what was the rationale behind deciding to keep it  and you have also announced them restructuring for two years in a row now  Where is that business today  and what brings the profitability levels back up to that 6 5  range that you are guiding to Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell look  Kautex  as we have always talked about  is a good business  it has been a good cash generator for us  it generates like very good ROIC  solid returns  And we were asked and sort of heard from a lot of investors  that maybe this is something that within the portfolio  holds back our PE and our ability to generate a better stock price  So we said like  we are going to go look at this  We went into the process  knowing that considering the profitability of that business  and for where things were in the automotive sector  that we would probably see some dilution  But some dilution  versus a potential rerate on the multiple  could result in something good for our shareholders  As we went through the process  the reality was that what was    the pricing in terms of what anyone would be willing to pay for that business right now  would have created a level of dilution  There is no way in our view  would have created enough of a rerate on the multiple  that would be good for our shareholders So we  we went through the process  it was very rigorous we ve looked at a lot of different alternatives and options and in the end  there was no way for us to get our head around this being  something that would be accretive for our shareholders  And again  it s a good business  it generates good cash  it generates good earnings  but we re also sitting at kind of a low part of an automotive cycle  but that team has done a really nice job of managing through that  and it has  Indecipherable  business  Obviously  we did some restructuring  because we think that there is    you re probably toward the bottom of the auto cycle  but it s not going to come snapping back  So we wanted to make sure that we made sure we adjusted the right cost  so that as we go through a period of relatively speaking  lower volumes  we maintain good margins on the business  and I think we ll do that Sheila Kahyaoglu    Jefferies    AnalystThanks OperatorOur next question is from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research  Please go ahead  your line is open Eric Salander    Vice President of Investor RelationsCarter  are you there OperatorOkay  Mr  Copeland  your line is open Eric Salander    Vice President of Investor RelationsWhy don t we go to the next one  Kevin OperatorOne moment please  Next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski  Please go ahead  sir Pete Skibitski    Alembic    AnalystThanks  Scott  sorry to beat on this  but  so the plant 3 issue  that s more of a revenue issue in the first half than a margin issue  Am I understanding that right  So the margin pressure in 2020 is almost wholly due to the Longitude  is that accurate Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  no Pete  I think that the lower volume obviously  in Q1 and Q2  considering that we period expense all of our R D and our SG A  I mean  our costs are going to be more evenly spread over the course of the year  So when you pull 10 or 15 aircraft out  that s a big chunk of revenue  and particularly  it s a lot of our legacy good margin business  So I think that it s a combination of both  the progression of Longitude profitability through the course of the year  But the Q1  Q2 impact of missing that revenue is not trivial  And that s why I thought I would help to try to guide what we expect that margin rate to look like  through the course of the year Pete Skibitski    Alembic    AnalystYeah    no  that s helpful  Thank you  And so if things stay on track  I know you said in the past  you want this business to be a double digit business  is there any reason to think that can t be true in 2021  assuming these problems  Obviously  you re going up the learning curve on Longitude  but assuming plant 3 doesn t happen again Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  look  we are going to be careful Pete  We re not quite ready to guide 2021 just yet  But yeah  look  as you get into the third and fourth quarter  I would expect to see margin rates in Aviation that are indicative of how that business should perform in a normal place  And as I said  that should be in that high single digit to low double digit range Pete Skibitski    Alembic    AnalystOkay  Thanks guys Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSure OperatorNext question is from the line    one moment please  And its David Strauss of Barclays  Please go ahead David Strauss    Barclays    AnalystThanks  Good morning  You noted in in Q4 at Aviation  inflation net of pricing was a headwind  Could you maybe break the pieces out there  inflation versus pricing  And then also  how you re thinking or what you ve got baked in for inflation versus pricing in the 2020 guide for Aviation Frank T  Connor    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo  I mean the dynamic in Q4 was    price was pretty flattish  and so that s why we have a negative  because clearly  there was some inflation in Q4  and we didn t have price to offset that  So it was fairly flat  Again part of our dynamic and rationale for pulling back on the volume  particularly on those legacy aircraft  is to make sure that we can maintain the price levels that we have in the industry  So I don t think we ll probably get into breaking out sort of the components of the guide around the price inflation number  But clearly  we would like to drive to get that back in balance David Strauss    Barclays    AnalystOkay  And following up on a question on a couple of quarters    a couple of quarters ago I asked was on the potential upside from MAX simulators  Obviously now it looks like  there is going to be mandatory simulator training  Could you just talk about what you ve seen maybe in terms of order interest there and potential upside from this Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we have    certainly continue to see order interest  I think particularly now with what you ve seen out there publicly around the need for MAX sim training and some capacity associated with the return to service  That s picking up  So we ve largely been following the lead of Boeing  who is our biggest customer in this space  and we are going to increase the number of MAX simulators that we have in production  So I think that s good  But you know  for our total company  it s not going to be a material impact  but it is    we will certainly see a little bit of an upside on the number of MAX sims David Strauss    Barclays    AnalystOkay  Thanks very much OperatorOur next question is from the line    one moment please  Jon Raviv of Citi  Please go ahead Jon Raviv    Citigroup    AnalystThank you  Good morning Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Jon Raviv    Citigroup    AnalystHey just apologies here  jumping back the Aviation margin  I mean I appreciate that high single digit  low double digit in second half is normative  But really just still thinking about the overall underlying earnings power of this business  I mean at some point  we were always thinking that this could be a pretty strong incremental margin business  clearly with rates down with each of that this year  but as you kind of reemerge out of what could be a tough year this year  given some of the dynamics  is it still fair to think about  this is a double digit type business going forward  given some of the changes you ve made Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAbsolutely  that s our expectation and I think that  where we ve    we obviously had a fair bit of dilution here in Q4  and expect that in the first half of next year  I mean  if you set the plant 3 thing aside  which is an unusual circumstance obviously  Longitude  we fully expect to be a strong margin product  It s an outstanding product  We ve got a bunch of them in the field now  It s been well received by customers  It s flying beautifully  Feedback on those who have taken delivery  Several customers who are flying this thing hard  is outstanding  So I think this thing is going to be a great part of the business  But clearly  there was a lot more costs in 2019 and getting through the certification process and all that was entailed there  and we still have costs as we go into 2020 in pursuit of certifications around the world  and the entry into service  there is always some costs associated with these things  as you roll them out into the marketplace  But this thing is going to be an outstanding product  It s going to be a product that has the kind of margin rates that we expect across our jet line  and this is a transient problem  I think we end up in a very good place  and we have every expectation for this business to be a double digit margin business Jon Raviv    Citigroup    AnalystThanks  And then  you talked about how some of the restructuring is based on lower development plans going forward  Something I think has helped you guys recently  is investing in new products and the ability to drive some growth in what could be a flattish market  How do you think about that going forward  I mean  there are still parts of your portfolio  some would suggest could use some upgrades here and there  So how are you thinking about the Skylane  beyond SkyCourier and Denali Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  I think if you look at the product portfolio right now in Aviation  obviously the last five years of driving Latitude and Longitude have completely transformed our jet product line  and positions in a very good place  when you think about the SkyCourier  which is this fabulous product and a new market    segment for us really  is going to be a great growth driver  We ve not been in the high performance single  that s our rationale for Denali  Its a great market  which I think will get very good  Indecipherable  Beyond that  we obviously always have some things that we re looking at  I think there is clearly opportunities to do some upgrades and refreshes across some of the core of the rest of our product line  in both the jet and the turboprop side of things  And so we will pursue those  They just won t be of the magnitude of a clean sheet  brand new airplane like a Latitude or Longitude  So when we talk about pulling back on some of the R D  I think that s just reflecting that you don t have two major Part 25 aircraft that are in process  So I think we ll continue to have a robust product line  up both in the SkyCourier  Denali and other upgrades  So I m not at all concerned that we re going to underwhelm the R D side  we know you have to do and refresh products to continue to drive growth here The same is true across the rest of our portfolio  I mean we obviously made massive investments in things like the V 280 program  the 525 program  put a lot of money into the  Indecipherable  program  You will actually see some R D come down in that business  as we go into next year  but that s really driven  because you have things like FLRAA and FARA that have been virtually all funded under IR D  will now start to move into a larger cost share on a couple of government programs  and clearly 525 is winding down in terms of the level of R D to support its certification So those two businesses drive the bulk of R D  Obviously Systems is a smaller number  but still  if you look at things that are the new programs that are are happening and starting to drive growth  which we re seeing in 2020  its as a result of the investments that we ve been making in some of those product lines around everything from the next generation of unmanned air vehicles like FTUAS  I mean obviously Ship to Shore was a huge investment  as that turns production  that s going to help to drive some growth and much improved profitability  The M5  this RCV is    again this is a lot of R D that we ve been putting into these businesses and in some cases  small acquisitions over the last few years  that are starting to turnaround and drive growth in those businesses Jon Raviv    Citigroup    AnalystI appreciate all that color  Scott  Thank you OperatorYour next question is from the line    one moment please  of Seth Seifman of JP Morgan  Please go ahead Seth Seifman    JP Morgan    AnalystThanks very much and good morning  Scott  when you talked about the outlook being for flattish overall delivery volumes with Longitude adding and the legacy portfolio coming down  I mean  there is generally not a ton of visibility    is that expected decline in the legacy portfolio kind of a view of what you re seeing in the spot market  Or is it    the majority of Latitude delivery has got one customer  and that customer is changing its mix of deliveries from Cessna Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI m not sure I understand entirely Seth  I mean   Seth Seifman    JP Morgan    AnalystBasically  if legacy deliveries are coming down  a lot of the legacy deliveries are Latitudes to NetJets  Is NetJets coming down significantly and making a transformation from Latitude to Longitude  And that s why legacy deliveries are down  or is it your sense of the spot market being weaker  and that s why legacy deliveries are down Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think in general  as we talked about in Q3  we expect legacy deliveries just to be down  given the outlook of the overall market  You re right  when you look at Latitude  yeah we do expect lower levels of deliveries to NetJet on latitudes next year versus this year  And you re right  I m not    I think don t it s necessarily a trade  just where the market is right now  with Longitude coming as a brand new product  you ll see a lot more deliveries to NetJet of the Longitude class aircraft in 2020  So yes  I mean you re right  there are certainly    we certainly expect to deliver fewer latitudes next year  two NetJets than we had previously  but the dynamic of the legacy is  is it just a somewhat softer market  not inconsistent with how we saw it back in Q3 Seth Seifman    JP Morgan    AnalystYeah  understood  Understood  And then on Bell  you ve kind of traditionally talked about Bell as a 10  to 12  margin business  starting the guide this year at 12 5   I mean  the business has executed very well for probably like five years or so now  Is the baseline margin for Bell kind of maybe higher than you thought Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerLook  I would still say we re in that 10  to 12  range  So I think at 12 5   obviously it s a very strong performance for that business  We feel very good about it  Particularly    we still have a very high level of R D  Again  we will benefit a little bit from having higher levels of cost share  as we move some of the military programs into    initiate real military acquisition programs  as opposed to straight IRAD funded  But yeah  look  I think the position that Bell is in right now  is quite strong  If you had a large EMV program  which tends to be the lower margin  that s going to mix it down a little bit  But I think you re going to stay in that 10  to 12  margin rate even in that circumstance  which obviously would be a terrific new story  right  that you re driving a    what will be a very large EMV program with a lot of future growth in the production phase Seth Seifman    JP Morgan    AnalystGreat Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI would kind of leave that 10  to 12  out there Seth Seifman    JP Morgan    AnalystThanks very much  Scott OperatorAnd next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Robert Spingarn    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning  I wanted to    Scott  to go to    back to the higher level view here  and you touched on valuation and your desire to improve it  when you were answering Sheila s question on Kautex and disposition  and I wanted to go to the valuation  think about cash flows  You ve got sales growth in 2020  but we ve gone through a period here  let s say from  18 to  20  where earnings and cash flows have been somewhat flattish  and that s the case in the forecast to    and you ve talked about a number of the reasons  What needs to happen to get the cash flow return on sales above this kind of 5  level  Other than learning curve on Longitude and some of the other puts and takes you ve talked about  what is the potential for this business  And then separately for Frank  just regarding the extra week  I guess  in the fourth quarter and the year  how does that play out in 2020  Are we back to where we were Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell now let me take it from a high level  OK  We ve had Bell that has gone over the last few years from a  4 5 billion business in the peak of the V 22 world  down to  3 2 billion   3 3 billion business  At the same time that it has been investing heavily in things like 525 and things like V 280 and obviously V 22 has done a significant ramp down from the 48 year to 20 year low double digit year So I think our focus in that business has been  making sure that we re investing for the future  while still maintaining strong execution and strong margin rates  And I think we ve been able to do that  and I certainly think we re at a point here  as we go forward into 2020  there is some really important milestones around where the acquisition process goes on things like the V 280 program finally going through and completing search on 525  So things that have been    costs with no revenue or margin over the last few years  so there have certainly been pressure points  right  So the margin has stayed good  but the absolute number has certainly come down  owing to the reduced revenue  But I think we re in a really really good place to see that turn here  as we go through the next few years Systems is a smaller   Robert Spingarn    Credit Suisse    AnalystTo get the revenue turn a little bit here  you ve got decent revenue growth in 2020  are you saying you catch up on the other end  2021  2022 Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAbsolutely  Look  I think as we said  part of what we see here in the interim on Bell is this transition from unit deliveries to a very large and growing installed base  which starts to drive more aftermarket  and that s what we re seeing  What s driving the growth in in 2020  is that you re starting to see the significant growth in the aftermarket side of the business  largely military  but also some on the commercial side  owing to the fact that we have a very large installed base now out there on the V 22 in the H1 programs  What really then will drive that next tranche of growth is driven around some of these new platforms  in which we ve been investing  like the V 280s and the 525s So that is the dynamic in Bell systems  There is a similar story  right  we had some great platforms  The platforms that    are sort of on the downside of their program of record  as they phased out  but you start to see the new program wins  Again  the investments that we ve been making that are now positioned and are awarding and winning some of these contracts  that will get that thing back to where we see revenue growth in the business Look  I think systems this year delivering 10  plus margins  forecasting 10  plus margins  That s a good business  The issue for us has been to get the overall business to start to drive positive revenue  and we re going to see that in 2020  as we ve guided and talked about  So I think that one s already making that turn Aviation  again we are going through a very heavy period of investment that has resulted in the Latitudes  the Longitudes  It has been frustrating to see that sort of    in many cases  just sort of replace legacy platforms  but without having that portfolio with a Latitude and Longitude  you d be in a really tough spot  So I feel great about where that business is positioned  The team has historically executed very well  as we have just    with drone production  Obviously  we have a challenge around Longitude and just getting those margins where they need to be  But we clearly have a line of sight to get there  as we work our way through 2020  Obviously  that business is much more dependent on what does the end market do beyond 2020  into 2021 and we have no idea how to make that call yet  But I think we have a really good product line and a couple of other things in the pipeline  obviously that will help that So our earnings have been growing  but we ve had too much pressure on not enough revenue growth  and I think we re seeing where the opportunities are here in 2020  as we saw at the end of 2019  that we can get the topline to start growing Robert Spingarn    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  Thank you for all that color OperatorThank you  Next question is from the line of Noah Poponak  Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  good morning everyone Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Noah Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs    AnalystScott  any new revelations into why the business jet market deteriorated over the last three to six months  And specifically  why used inventory keeps going back up every month  You just typically don t see this in the middle of an economic cycle  Is it just PMIs have been weak and global growth just hasn t broken out  and it s as simple as that  Or anything new you ve learned there Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Look  I don t think we ve seen as much growth over the last six months  I think there has certainly been plenty of reasons for small and mid sized business guys  which is the bulk of our customer base in the jet market  to have some pause    and look  you ve seen this in capex spending  right  they ve been holding back a little bit  So I think as some of the trade    things are starting to get a little bit    that noise is sort of settling down  the Brexit noise  which again I don t    shouldn t have a huge direct impact on us  but it does create uncertainty in the in the market  That seems like it s on a path to at least becoming resolved in certain  and look  we re in the middle of a very political cycle right now  So I think as we work our way through the year and politics and where things are going to land  become more clearer  then it would be optimistic that businesses would get back to a more aggressive move  in terms of willingness to spend capex and invest in their businesses  not just an aircraft  but in general  which is certainly what drove a lot of the growth If you went back into the the late  17 early  early part of  18  So we re hopeful that that happens  but we need to see that happen Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs    AnalystDo your customers specify to you that an election is particularly concerning to them  and kind of puts them on pause  or not necessarily Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI d rather not get into the politics of it  Noah  but I mean certainly  there is different views about what the business climate looks like  depending on the outcome of the election  So it s kind of natural that there d be some reflection on that  with people that are businesspeople Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAnd then Frank  on the cash flow outlook for 2020  can you help us out with the net Longitude related working capital assumption you re making in there  Because I think you had a decent amount to unwind  but you re also still ramping the production rate  So I would just like to understand that piece  and then therefore the underlying total company piece outside of that Frank T  Connor    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think kind of overall  the guide  at least at the upper end  reflects one to one cash conversion on net income  So we re generally expecting good working capital performance  There isn t anything extraordinary in there kind of relative to Longitude  There kind of continue to expect maybe some ramp in the Longitude  But there is nothing significant from a working capital standpoint  kind of embedded in that guide  I did say that  kind of certainly  19  we did work our way through all the headwind associated with multiyear 2  transitioning to multiyear 3  So as it relates to 2019 cash performance  we absorbed hundreds of millions of dollars of that reversal in 2019  that did kind of reflect on that  19 performance  and kind of we put that behind us  as we move into  20  So we re expecting that we ll see good cash flow performance in  20 Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs    AnalystI thought you had been saying  19 was pretty substantially impacted by Longitude build up and that that would release beyond  19 Frank T  Connor    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell there is some of that  but kind of there is    you can see some inventory build  if there is kind of payables from an overall working capital standpoint that    part also go to offset some of that build  The biggest drag on  19 was this    at Bell with the kind of government payments timing  where we were kind of ahead on multiyear 2  and then we    multiyear 3 structure has us kind of incurring costs  before we receive cash  And so that was a big reversal that impacted  19  that we will not see in  20 Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  thanks so much OperatorNext question is from the line of Robert Stallard of Vertical Research  Please go ahead Robert Stallard    Vertical Research    AnalystThanks so much  Good morning Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Robert Robert Stallard    Vertical Research    AnalystScott  first of all on the business jet pricing environment  I was wondering if you re seeing any of your competitors acting in an even more irrational manner  in response to the demand environment  or perhaps you re seeing any change in response to the Longitude and its entry into service Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell in general  I guess  I don t know that we ve seen a huge change  Robert  This is    again  I think we probably all want to be cautious about making sure that we are not running production greater than demand  right  That always will create some bad behavior in the market  Of course  it s always the other guy  right  so that s    we just want to make sure we re not participating in that process  And look  I think we have fought to get pricing back to a reasonable level  that represents the value of the product and I think we got that back over that  17   18 timeframe  So we just want to make sure that we hold pricing and get the increases that are reflective of inflation going on  right  It is a perfectly reasonable business position to take that thing  So  I think in general  that s the overall dynamic  is the way we see it and how we think we should    how we think we should behave On Longitude pricing  I d say we re    I think we re pleased with that  We are getting the value that we expect to get from an aircraft that s performing very well  The customers love the cabin  the range  the speed and the price levels in there are appropriate and we re continuing to make sure that we re getting the right value of aircraft Robert Stallard    Vertical Research    AnalystOkay  And then as a follow up  and a different matter actually  on Kautex and the decision there to not sell the business  If the automotive environment were to improve  multiples were to move higher  would you reconsider this sale in the future Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI don t think we will make    we don t make any comments about M A  We went out and we had to do this in a public way  which was very difficult as you can imagine on our team  to go to go through that  But I mean our general view is  we don t really want to forecast or comment one way or the other on M A and I think given where we are in that process  we will go back to that practice  So its a good business  does really well for us and we re going to focus on running it Robert Stallard    Vertical Research    AnalystThanks Scott OperatorAnd next  we have the George Shapiro of Shapiro Research  Please go ahead George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystYes  good morning Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning George George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystYeah  I was just wondering  you know  we had talked about  if the economic environment got more stable toward the end of the year  that you would see some improvement in the business  It sounds like from your comments that you haven t and I was just wondering why you might think that is  I mean we still have a pretty good environment  economic and stock market wise Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGeorge  I don t know  I mean I can t    I m not  I m not trying to be an economic forecaster  but I think there s still a fair bit of uncertainty and a lot of it at this point is    I think the trade things seem like they re quieting down  but there is still enormous amount of political uncertainty that is in front of us every day  So I think in large part  people want to see how all this plays out  It makes a big difference  when you think about tax policies and things of that nature  So I think that    look the market hasn t stopped  There is still a fair bit of activity going on  There s lots of conversations going on  But it s    I think that  it still does    that uncertainty does create some friction to people going ahead and doing a deal  And that s why    again  that s why we pull back a little bit on production and where our position is that customers are going to make their decision  we are not going to use price to go accelerate decisions  if they don t want to make that decision yet George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystAnd have you seen any tougher competition from Bombardier  given the state that they are in  And would you ever have an interest in their aviation part of the business Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell like I said  I don t think we ve seen any dramatic change in the dynamic and    look  lots of deals are competitive deals and price activity and whatnot  is    seems like it s been fairly stable  So I don t see a big change in that  And look  with respect to the M A side  again  we see the articles and hear all the noise  that we would not comment on any M A activity George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystOkay  And Frank  one for you  The inventories were up like  250 million for the year  I mean  so what is still in inventory that effectively wasn t delivered in the fourth quarter Frank T  Connor    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s across the entirety of the corporation  George  But again that s    we are ramping Longitude  and so there is additional inventory at Aviation that reflects that ramp George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystYeah  I was just wondering  because the cash flow turned out a little bit weaker than you were expecting  and so I thought maybe there is something else going on there Frank T  Connor    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  Cash flow is right in the middle of our guide and kind of again  as I said before  the cash was impacted  certainly for the year by a significant headwind at Bell  associated with the military programs George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystAnd then I guess one last one  the profit mix at Industrial between Special and Kautex  you ve alluded to in the release  that it was primarily special vehicles  If Kautex wasn t down much  it would imply that special vehicles didn t earn much in the quarter  I mean  is that a correct assumption  And if so  if you can expand on why Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGeorge  we don t    generally we don t get into the margin mix in the segment  I think the commentary was that  as it relates to vehicles  we certainly had a lower volume year over year  and as Frank said  a big part of that was snow because we delivered snow product largely in Q3 versus Q4 a year ago and we should be delivering it in Q3  So it s a good thing that we did it in Q3 versus Q4  So the overall volume was lower  which certainly has an impact on margin  But we re not going to break out any more detail on the margin split between the different sub segments George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystOkay  Thanks very much Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSure OperatorNext question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr  Cowen   Company  Please go ahead Cai von Rumohr    Cowen   Company    AnalystSo Scott  maybe update us the upcoming down select for FARA and FLRAA  and if you win one or both of them  what s the    because you know  essentially a win is just take it to the next level of competition  What s the chance that you will be spending some of your own money and    I know the dollars that they have for you are not huge  But you ll be spending some of your own money and therefore  that would be an earnings drag  because you want to win  what s really a very sizable potential Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSo our guide incorporates that  Cai  So we have been spending our IRAD money with really no match on FARA and little match over the years on FLRAA  There certainly has been some government money on the V 280 program  But again  largely that s been funded through our IRAD numbers  So what we have in our plans  as you look at 2020  the amount of R D actually increases in Bell  But you have a much higher level of participation of government co funding  than we had just under straight IRAD funding So it takes us something like a FARA  And with FARA  I think they will down select to the two companies to go through the fly off  We expect that to be in the February to March timeframe  is what they re saying  What we love our offering  we ve talked a lot about thinking that it s    this is a fabulous performance  It clearly meets their requirements  We think it s taking great new technology that we matured on 525  The Army    remember running the program  is they provide a few very high level critical requirements  but they re not prescriptive in terms of how you accomplish that  So the down select process from five to two will happen  again probably in that February March timeframe  If it does happen  we will have a lot more R D effort in the business  but it will actually be less R D  in terms of IRAD than we spent in previous periods  because again  you do have a very large portion of government cost share  where we had none before on that program  So it s relatively neutral to the overall plan  Even though it s a lot more R D because of the dynamic of the cost share The FLRAA program  again  you re right  this is    the anticipation is that sometime probably in the March timeframe  what they re saying is they would award two contracts in all likelihood  they don t    so it has to be two  but sort of expectation I suppose it s two  With V 280  we obviously have the expectation that we would be one of those  That s not a huge program  because it really is going through and sort of crossing T s and dotting I s and working on risk reduction toward the ultimate EMD or OTA decision  which is probably still in late 2021  is what they re saying  So that s not a big mover for us one way or the other in the year  But the FARA program is  But again it s not a headwind because you re    even though you have a much higher level of of R D on that program  it does have a large cost share Cai von Rumohr    Cowen   Company    AnalystTerrific  Great answer  And then second one  the Corona virus clearly becoming a bigger issue  Have you done any preliminary thinking in terms of what this might mean  i e  taking a look at 2003 and the SARS virus  and was this a benefit the biz jets  because people didn t want to travel on public air transport or were not allowed to  Was this a negative  What does it do for Bell  What are your thoughts Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell Cai  it s a good question  Look  I m not going back to 2003 to try to do that  So I don t know that I    I certainly don t know the answer to that question  I mean in terms of the direct impact of the company  obviously we do business in China  largely in the automotive side  So of course automotive  volumes have already been down pretty dramatically in the last couple of years  So whether it has a further impact on that or not is hard to tell and I think like everyone  we ve got to watch and wait and see what happens here after we get through the Chinese New Year and does this thing get contained  start to settle down or does it become a bigger problem  So at this point  I think we re more or less in a watch and wait Cai von Rumohr    Cowen   Company    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  And our final question on today s conference is from the line of Carter Copeland of Melius Research  Please go ahead Carter Copeland    Melius Research    AnalystAll right  Good morning  gentlemen  I have figured out how to use the mute button  So for anybody who has been on A D call for years  this isn t my first screw up  So thanks for having me back  Scott  if I    I wondered if you could give us some color on the Board decision around the changes to the incentive compensation plan  the addition of TSR to that  and just what that    what we should take from that  in terms of    what you see is the relative risks and opportunities for the corporation Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell look  Carter  I mean the genesis of that thing is that for many many years  this company has been on a long term plan that kind of rolled through three years  Okay  So it was a three year plan that had TSR as kind of a wrapper  if you will  around that three year performance  So TSR was absolutely a factor  But the goals and objectives were set annually  and that really stems back to just enormous volatility around business jets and can you really put together a three year plan  that has any credibility to it  So the new plan  obviously still has TSR  It has a direct factor  as opposed to a wrap around  So it remains a very important part of our performance objectives  and ultimately our compensation  But we are trying to put together something that could do a three year forecasted plan  rather than the series of one year plans to build that three year plan  So    and we tried to do longer term metrics like things around ROICs and long term cash and just    we just have to adapt and considers a lot of unknown around    one of the fact    that one of our business  business  The biggest business is  is a biz jet business  where it s just hard to predict what that end market looks like over a period of three years  So I think we ve come up with a set of metrics that can accommodate some of that volatility  and have a more conforming  if you will  three year plan  of which TSR still remains an important metric Carter Copeland    Melius Research    AnalystGreat  Thanks Scott Scott C  Donnelly    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSure Eric Salander    Vice

179488,401004,TXT,Textron Accelerates Growth Amid Restructuring Initiatives,news,"Textron  NYSE TXT  released solid fourth quarter 2019 results early on Wednesday  showcasing accelerated top line momentum with double digit percent growth from three of its four core business segments  Shares of the industrial conglomerate climbed around 3  in response as the market absorbed the news 
Let s dig deeper for a better idea of what drove Textron s results as 2019 came to a close  as well as what investors should be watching in the coming quarters 

Data source  Textron quarterly filings   For the quarter ended Jan  4  2020  
Breaking it down
This quarter included around  72 million of pre tax  or  0 24 per share after tax  charges mostly driven by restructuring initiatives announced last month with the aim of lowering costs and driving greater operational efficiency  Excluding one time items  Textron s  non GAAP  net income arrived at  1 11 per share  down modestly from  1 15 per share in the same year ago period 
By comparison  most analysts were modeling lower adjusted net income of  1 05 per share on revenue of  3 96 billion  

Textron s Aviation segment led the way  with revenue climbing 11 4  year over year to  1 729 billion  helped by the first deliveries of the company s new Cessna Citation Longitude jets  Textron Aviation delivered 71 jets during the quarter  up from 63 a year earlier  and 59 commercial turboprops  down from 67 a year ago   Segment profit declined 21 2   however  to  134 million  due to inflation and unfavorable product pricing mix 
Meanwhile  the Bell segment increased revenue 16 2  to  961 million  as the company delivered 76 commercial helicopters during the quarter  up from 46 in last year s Q4   That higher commercial volume drove a 9 3  increase in segment profit  to  118 million  Bell s Boeing program office was also awarded defense centric support contracts of more than  800 million in the fourth quarter 
Textron Systems segment revenue increased 15 7  to  399 million  primarily driven by higher volumes of unmanned systems products  Systems  segment profit fell 10 8  to  33 million    a trend management vaguely chalked up to  unfavorable performance  that was only partially offset by the higher volumes and favorable product mix 
Finally  Industrial segment revenue fell 8  to  927 million  driven by lower volumes of Textron s Specialized Vehicles products  given a shift in timing of  snow  product sales at the company s Arctic Cat brand  Industrial segment profit was down 39 7  to  44 million  given both the volume shift and lower volumes at the Kautex business 
Driving forward
For the full year 2020  Textron is targeting revenue of roughly  14 billion  up from  13 6 billion in 2019   including Aviation revenue of roughly  5 4 billion  Bell revenue of  3 3 billion  Systems revenue of  1 5 billion  and Industrial revenue of  3 8 billion  On the bottom line  that should translate to 2020 earnings per share in the range of  3 50 to  3 70  Textron also called for 2020 manufacturing cash flow from continuing operations  before pension contributions of roughly  50 million  of between  700 million and  800 million 
For perspective  this guidance was technically mixed relative to Wall Street s consensus estimates  which called for higher earnings of  3 75 per share on roughly the same revenue 
Of course  Textron could be underpromising with the intention of overdelivering  But even as Textron moves to lower expenses via restructuring and bolster earnings in light of its modest top line growth  this certainly explains the muted bounce investors offered after the news hit the wires ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp6vl,2072529

AUGUSTA  Georgia  Reuters    To wander the immaculately manicured grounds of Augusta National Golf Club during the U S  Masters is to take a stroll back in time

One of the world s most elite clubs  Augusta National operates under the principle that if you are obscenely wealthy there is no reason to advertise it  the only label here is the ever present Masters logo 
Outside the Augusta National walls  however  it is all business as some of the world s biggest brands cozy up alongside golf s most celebrated event to share in its glow 
This is  as one corporate executive put it  Spring Break and Coachella melded into one big corporate CEO filled mosh pit 
 The Masters is the number one corporate event of the year   Kenny Dichter  co founder and CEO of Wheels Up  a private aviation firm providing luxury service to the Masters  told Reuters   When you have CEOs and different corporate executives together in one place that s when magic happens 
 We just want to create the platform  the canvas  for our members to meet and talk and create  
That canvas is an expansive one of mansions  private jets  celebrity chefs  limousines  cigar bars and premium liquor 
It is part loyalty program  part new business 
For StubHub  Primesport and the 1018 Club  the Masters is their business  securing hard to acquire entry badges and setting up first rate hospitality experiences within a well struck Dustin Johnson three wood of Augusta National 
For IMG  a global talent management company  and auto giant Mercedes Benz  one of three Masters global sponsors  it is all about brand loyalty and providing a first class experience for their friends and partners 
Over in  Mercedesville   the luxury car maker has not just set up a Masters corporate hospitality headquarters but rather a village of mansions anchored by a lavish multi deck pavilion that serves as a restaurant entertainment center on the Savannah River in Augusta s posh River Island neighborhood 
Each night Mercedes hosts guests in an elegant setting where they are entertained by golfing celebrities such as brand ambassador Rickie Fowler  who finished an intimate chat on Tuesday by signing autographs for a smitten audience 
In the morning there will be no need to be up early and rush to the course to secure a prime spot in Amen Corner with the rest of the Masters mob 
That chore will be left to staff who make the dawn trek to set up folding chairs in prime locations while guests enjoy a leisurely breakfast back in Mercedesville 
 Everyone is just trying to stand out   said John Terzian  whose brand building company has hosted events at the Super Bowl  Monaco Grand Prix and top film festivals   To me  sports and entertainment have become the same thing in a good way 
 People are expecting and demanding the highest level when it comes to things like the Super Bowl 
 We operate on a very elite VIP level  We cater to extremely high end business people  
What makes the Masters so attractive is that it is one of those rare events that seems to be on everyone s bucket list  from weekend duffers to Fortune 500 CEOs 
Rated one of the most coveted tickets in all of sport  those lucky enough to land a Masters badge do not want to lessen the once in a lifetime experience by cutting corners 
A week at the Masters with a private plane  car service  a mansion  personal chef  driver and masseuse can easily top  100 000 
But companies like 1018 Club offer a taste of the Masters VIP experience for hundreds of dollars at their setup near the course with perks that include valet parking  buffet breakfast  lunch  beverages and shuttles to and from the gate 
Everything but the badges 
Without a Masters badge  however  a trip to Augusta this week would be a meaningless visit to Georgia s second biggest city where Textron  NYSE TXT  Specialized Vehicles  who manufacture 90 percent of the world s golf carts  is based 
 The Masters is a unique event and a lot of people are paying premium prices for this event so we put a lot of investment in and make sure the customer experience is the best it can possibly be   StubHub spokesman Cameron Papp told Reuters 
 The Masters has grown in popularity every year on StubHub and it has really turned into one of those bucket list events

179672,401188,TXT,Call the air ambulance  Medical helicopters tipped for future China boom,news,"By Siva Govindasamy and Fang Yan
SINGAPORE BEIJING  Reuters    As China opens up its low level airspace to civilian aircraft  the global aviation industry is laying the groundwork for a boom beyond private business jets and pilot training schools   with the purchase of fleets of air ambulance helicopters 
The freeing up of airways previously reserved for military use is a huge opportunity for Norbert Ducrot  head of Airbus Group  PA AIR  s helicopters unit in China  Ducrot says there could be enough demand for more than 3 000 emergency medical choppers in China   up from as few as about 20 now in service 
While the United States already has more than 1 500 air ambulance helicopters  China s fleet is minimal because of the civilian airspace curbs  In a country where the World Health Organisation has estimated more than 250 000 annual road traffic deaths  air evacuations from both clogged Chinese city streets and remote rural areas could speed medical care and save lives 
The change proposed by China s State Council is set to ultimately raise the ceiling on airspace for general aviation to 3 000 meters from 1 000 meters  That would radically multiply both the heights and the routes air ambulances could use  a boon for pioneers like Qian Siwei s China Air Medical Service Ltd 
 Emergency air medical services have a great growth potential in China because our target customer is the general public  not just the privileged   Qian  a gynecologist by training  told Reuters  While the going rate for a helicopter evacuation is around 30 000 yuan   4 565  per hour  companies like Qian s offer discount schemes that can cut costs by as much as 50 percent in some cases 
Based in the province of western Shaanxi  China Air Medical has a fleet of four helicopters and two business jets  operating with the backing of local authorities  Qian claimed his service has proved so popular that three other provinces have invited Chen Air Medical Service to set up similar operations 
China Air Medical is just one of a raft of operators across a broader aviation sector that Beijing is seeking to develop into a thriving home grown industry  State owned aircraft maker AVIC  which also supplies helicopters  is another 
But the liberalization is also enticing Western firms like Airbus and U S  aircraft maker  Textron Inc   NYSE TXT   keen to target what they see as a major growth opportunity 
HELIPADS  COMPLICATED 
For Airbus executive Ducrot  the arithmetic is simple  He expects to sell 60 helicopters to China this year   for prices he declined to disclose   and for the country to buy up to 300 helicopters annually by 2025 as its economic growth still outpaces developed markets and liberalization kicks in 
 By 2025  China will become the most important helicopter market in the world   said Ducrot 
While some local authorities are enthusiastic  as in Qian s case  and some modern hospitals may be able to accommodate helipads  China s healthcare sector is already creaking and ageing hospital infrastructure may act as a brake on air ambulance growth 
At the Sichuan Provincial People s Hospital in the city of Chengdu  southwestern China  engineer Liu Xiaoxi  said that when the facility was under construction in the 1980s  a helipad was considered  but rejected as being  too complicated  
 It s difficult to add things on to the building  especially as tall towers have sprung up on all four sides   said Liu  While some hospitals would be able to add them  he said   If you want to add a helipad on top of a building then you have to design that in early on in terms of the various beams and supports  
Still Beijing is ploughing ahead with reforms  despite uncertainty on issues like healthcare infrastructure  helipad construction and how Beijing will regulate a low level civil aviation business 
GROWTH WARNING
China could have 2 000 general aviation airports by 2030 if the country opens the sector up to private investment  says Francis Chao  publisher of monthly publication China Civil Aviation Report and a contractor with the U S  Federal Aviation Administration on U S  China aviation exchanges 
That compares with a projection by China s State Council of 500 airports by 2020 
But Chao warned growth could be restricted  without further relaxation on flight permits  availability of chartering and fuel supply  more and accessible airfield and flight services  
Apart from emergency medical services  companies like Airbus and Textron unit Bell Helicopters   which declined to comment for this story   are targeting sales in the rapidly growing domestic tourism market  fire fighting and police services  and by companies that need to patrol pipelines and power lines 
For example  Airbus agreed to set up a final assembly line for its H135 helicopters in Hefei  Anhui province in October 2015  It s also investing in support services like sales offices  maintenance hubs and a training center for pilots   the latter being in short supply across the country

179692,401208,TXT,After Iran feud  Obama and Netanyahu turn to Israel s aid wish list,news,"By Jeffrey Heller and Matt Spetalnick JERUSALEM WASHINGTON  Reuters    Rare agreement between two long bickering leaders may actually be in the cards when Israel s Benjamin Netanyahu and U S  President Barack Obama meet on Monday for the first time since the signing of the Iran nuclear deal  Their White House talks will be an important step towards a new U S  military aid package that could burnish the right wing prime minister s security credentials  now challenged by a wave of Palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks  The meeting  the first between the two leaders in 13 months  could also underpin Obama s assurances that he has Israel s back and help deflect accusations from Republican presidential hopefuls that he and any Democrat successor are less pro Israel  But Israeli Palestinian peace  a goal that has eluded Obama during his two terms  will likely take a back seat to a reaffirmation of strategic ties   though aides say he will still press the Israeli leader for steps to help keep alive the possibility of a two state solution for any future negotiations   The president has made clear that we re not going to get a two state settlement during the time of his administration   a senior U S  official said in the run up to the meeting   He has already said publicly that he doesn t think so   For Netanyahu  who infuriated the Obama administration by speaking against an emerging agreement with Iran in Congress in March at the invitation of the Republicans  it is now time  in his words  to move past the  disagreement in the family    Now we have to strengthen Israel  And I think that s the best guarantor of peace   he said last month  Asked how Iran will factor into the Obama Netanyahu talks  the senior U S  official said   The debate on Iran has subsided  Obviously we feel Congress has now closed that chapter   Seeking a boost in U S  defense aid  Israel argues that sanctions relief agreed by world powers under the July deal that curbs Iran s nuclear program will allow Tehran to invest more heavily in its missile development  while redoubling funding for Hezbollah and Hamas guerrilla allies on its borders  Israel now receives  3 1 billion from the United States annually and wants  5 billion per year for 10 years  for a total of  50 billion  Congressional officials have told Reuters  Israeli government spokesmen declined to provide details on the defense aid talks  but one U S  official predicted the sides would settle for an annual sum of  4 billion to  5 billion  U S  officials said no agreement on a new aid agreement would be signed during Netanyahu s visit but that he and Obama would  sort of give their blessing  to the Memorandum of Understanding  MOU  negotiations  Under the MOU  Israel may seek to expand its order of 50 F 35 fighter jets  deliveries of which are due to begin next year  It will be the first country in the Middle East to have the aircraft  Israel could also revisit its plans to buy V 22 Osprey tilt rotor planes built by Boeing  N BA  Co and Textron  N TXT  Inc s Bell Helicopter unit   IRRITANTS U S  officials acknowledge that some irritants in relations with Israel are likely to remain  especially if the current right wing makeup of Netanyahu s cabinet is unchanged and some ministers continue casting doubt on the two state solution  Obama was especially irked by Netanyahu s vow during the heat of a tough re election campaign earlier this year that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch  Even when Netanyahu backtracked and insisted he was not reneging on long time Israeli policy  the White House was unconvinced  So Obama  whose Middle East agenda has been mostly hijacked by the Syrian conflict  will still be looking for the Israeli premier to reaffirm his commitment to a two state solution with the Palestinians during his U S  visit  Still  no one expects Obama and Netanyahu  after years of acrimony  will even make much of an effort to overcome their poor personal chemistry   Some of Obama s aides  in fact  believe that beyond working to firm up military packages  Netanyahu is content to wait out the final 14 months of Obama s presidency  hoping for a better reception for his hardline approach from the next president   As the administration heads into its final year  a full reset for the bilateral relationship is unlikely   wrote David Makovsky  an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank  But  he added   Neither Obama nor Netanyahu seems to want another stormy encounter   For now  U S  officials want Netanyahu to avoid inflammatory rhetoric such as his recent comments linking a late Muslim leader to Nazi Germany s Holocaust  During his three day visit  he will address a U S  Jewish group and speak at conservative and liberal think tanks  As Netanyahu prepared to embark on the trip  a controversy over his appointment of a new communications director raised hackles in Washington and at home  Comments on social media by the nominee  Ran Baratz  a 42 year old academic  accused Obama of anti Semitism and suggested that Secretary of State John Kerry had the mental abilities of a 12 year old  The State Department said Kerry had spoken to the Israeli leader on Thursday and understood that Netanyahu  will be reviewing  the appointment after the White House talks  Netanyahu  who said he had been unaware of Baratz s Facebook  O FB  entries and website articles   posted before the appointment was announced   challenged the State Department s interpretation of his conversation with Kerry

179709,401225,TXT,Wanted  500 000 pilots for China aviation gold rush,news,"By Fang Yan and Matthew Miller BEIJING  Reuters    China s national civil aviation authority says the country will need to train about half a million civilian pilots by 2035  up from just a few thousand now  as wannabe flyers chase dreams of landing lucrative jobs at new air service operators 
The aviation boom comes as China allows private planes to fly below 1 000 meters from next year without military approval  seeking to boost its transport infrastructure  Commercial airlines aren t affected  but more than 200 new firms have applied for general aviation operating licenses  while China s high rollers are also eager for permits to fly their own planes 
The civil aviation authority s own training unit can only handle up to 100 students a year  With the rest of China s 12 or so existing pilot schools bursting at the seams  foreign players are joining local firms in laying the groundwork for new courses that can run to hundreds of thousands of dollars per trainee 
 The first batch of students we enrolled in 2010 were mostly business owners interested in getting a private license   said Sun Fengwei  deputy chief of the Civil Aviation Administration of China s  CAAC  pilot school   But now more and more young people also want to learn flying so that they can get a job at general aviation companies  
While uncertainties remain for what will be a brand new industry  firms are betting they can make money and trainee pilots are convinced they can land dream jobs  Among them is Zong Rui  a 28 year old former soldier in the People s Liberation Army from Shandong province in east China  attending a pilot school in Tianjin  an hour s drive from Beijing 
 The salary is good for a general aviation pilot   Zong told Reuters by telephone  preparing for a training session  Even without a job lined up  Zong is certain money he borrowed to learn how to fly will pay off   I can easily pay back the 500 000 yuan   81 750  tuition in two years  once I get a job  
OPEN SKIES
By the end of the year  industry executives expect Beijing to issue detailed guidelines on how it will implement plans unveiled in 2010 to open up airspace below 1 000 meters in 2015  expanding the open skies to airspace below 3 000 meters by 2020 
Global makers of small planes  like Cessna Aircraft Company  N TXT   Pilatus Aircraft Ltd or Piaggio Aero Industries SpA  have long had their sights on China s burgeoning general aviation market 
Now they re being joined by air service providers like Tasmania based Rotor Lift Aviation  which has helped train pilots in Hong Kong  Malaysia and other Asian countries 
 I came here for opportunities   said Peter McKenzie  Rotor Lift training manager  McKenzie has been in talks to establish a training program for Chinese general aviation pilots in Australia as well as a joint venture 
Taking training outside China is an option also favored by China s biggest aircraft maker  Aviation Industry Corporation of China  which has invested in a flying school in South Africa 
Other foreign players include Spain s Indra Sistemas  MC IDR   the first foreign company certified by CAAC to implement a full flight simulator for helicopters in China  Canada s CAE Inc  TO CAE  also operates a partly owned flight training center in south China 
While the majority of new trainee pilots set their sights on a license as a means to a career  for some among China s more affluent classes it s a key to a flamboyant new hobby 
For Li Zheng  33 year old owner of an advertising company  driving a fancy car isn t that exciting anymore  He has set his sights on flying his own plane 

 I love sports  especially those with a challenge  like flying   said Li  a former hot air balloon racer  speaking just before a training flight  Li s ultimate goal  buying an airplane to fly with his wife  who recently joined Abu Dhabi based Etihad Airways as a flight attendant

179732,401248,TXT,Textron  TXT  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Surpass Estimates,opinion,"Textron  TXT  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 11 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 08 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 15 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2 78   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters would post earnings of  0 85 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 95  delivering a surprise of 11 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Textron  which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  posted revenues of  4 04 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 64   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 75 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Textron shares have added about 2 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 4  
What s Next for Textron 
While Textron has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Textron was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 75 on  3 21 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 61 on  13 89 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Aerospace   Defense is currently in the bottom 33  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/textron-txt-q4-earnings-and-revenues-surpass-estimates-200502625,200502625
179750,401266,TXT,Will Textron  TXT  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Textron  TXT   which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10 59  
For the last reported quarter  Textron came out with earnings of  0 95 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 85 per share  representing a surprise of 11 76   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 85 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 93 per share  delivering a surprise of 9 41  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Textron lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier

179791,401307,TXT,Textron  TXT  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Textron  TXT  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 17  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 86 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  41  
Revenues are expected to be  3 42 billion  up 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 64  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Textron 
For Textron  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  10 47  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Textron will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Textron would post earnings of  0 85 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 93  delivering a surprise of  9 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Strong organic growth in Q219
TXT reported year on year revenue growth of 57  for Q219  of which 26  was organic  The recent Cheleo and Assioma acquisitions contributed revenue of  3 0m in Q219  On a divisional organic revenue basis  the Aerospace  Aviation   Automotive division grew 25  and Banking   Finance 33  in Q219  Gross margins were lower on a year on year basis due to the higher mix of services revenues  Normalised EBIT grew 108  y o y  generating a margin of 7 3   up from 5 5  a year ago  Net cash at the end of H119 was  44 2m  reflecting the payment of dividends and the acquisition of Assioma in H119

Review of H119 results






TXT reported year on year revenue growth of 57 3  for Q219  compared with 26 5  in Q119  resulting in 42  growth for H119  Organic growth in Q219 was 26  y o y  Q119 17    with a further  3 0m contribution in Q2 from the Cheleo and Assioma acquisitions  consolidated from 1 August 2018 and 1 May 2019  respectively  
Revenues from software licenses and maintenance increased 18 4  y o y in Q219 while revenue from services increased 62 9  y o y  Of the  3 0m acquired revenue contributed in Q219   2 8m was reported within the services segment  The company noted that it had won important new contracts in the aerospace business  mainly in North America  which should provide further benefits to near term results 
Gross margin reduced in both Q219 and H119 reflecting the higher proportion of lower margin services revenues compared to last year  Normalised EBIT more than doubled in Q219 and was 50  higher for H119  reflecting the contribution from the acquired businesses  We have treated  346k of reorganisation costs in H119 as exceptional 
In FY18  the company invested the majority of its excess cash in multi segment insurance funds  which are marked to market  In H218  these were revalued downwards resulting in a net financial expense of  1 3m in FY18  Through the course of 2019 the assets have increased in value and the company reported net financial income of  1 8m for H119 
Net cash at the end of Q219 had reduced to  44 2m from  60 4m at the end of FY18  reflecting payment of the dividend in May   5 8m   payment to acquire Assioma   5 6m   purchase of treasury shares   1m  and newly capitalised leases   2 2m  





On a divisional basis  growth in the AAA division was all organic  Organic growth in the B F division was similarly strong  boosted by a  3 9m contribution from acquisitions in H119  In Q219  growth in AAA was 25   all organic  and 196  for B F  33  organic  
Management changes
In Q2  Marco Guida  CEO of the AAA division and previously group CEO  resigned and has since left the business  Daniele Misani  who has worked his entire career at TXT  has been appointed to this role and also the board 
The CFO  Paolo Matarazzo  resigned in July and will leave TXT at the end of September  Stepping into this role is Eugenio Forcinito  who has worked closely with Paolo at TXT for many years 
Outlook and changes to forecasts
In Q319  the company expects further revenue growth  both organic and from acquisitions  and for Q319 EBITA to be significantly ahead of Q318 
We have revised our forecasts to reflect Q2 results  Exhibit 3   As services revenues saw strong growth in H119  we have increased our services revenue forecasts for the remainder of FY19 and for FY20  We have also increased our operating cost forecasts to reflect increased investment across all cost lines  Based on the 31  tax rate achieved in H119  we have increased our tax rate forecast from 28  to 31  in FY19 and FY20  In FY19  these changes result in a 9 5  increase in normalised EPS  In FY20  the increase in the tax rate outweighs the small increase in normalised EBIT  resulting in a 5 8  decrease in normalised EPS  We note that our normalised EPS forecasts include net financial income of  1 8m in FY19  reflecting the upward valuation of short term investments in H119  whereas in FY20 we have a  0 3m net financial income forecast reflecting a modest return on cash  as we do not attempt to estimate the likely valuation of the short term investments   This somewhat skews the growth of EPS in both years

TXT reported Q119 revenue growth of 26 5  y o y  and 17 3  organic growth  The Aerospace  Aviation   Automotive  AAA  division was the biggest contributor to organic growth  up 20  y o y  with Banking   Finance up 6 6  on an organic basis  The cost base increased at a slightly faster rate than revenues  mainly due to a 63  increase in R D spend   resulting in normalised EBIT growth of 13 4  y o y  Marking to market the  100m invested in multi segment insurance funds resulted in financial income of  1 3m in Q119  which was the main factor in the 163  increase in net income y o y  We have revised our forecasts to reflect Q1 results and the Assioma acquisition  resulting in upgrades to normalised EPS of 31  in FY19 and 22  in FY20  Management confirmed that it continues to seek appropriately priced acquisitions in both divisions 
Valuation  Accretive acquisitions to drive upside
TXT is trading on EV multiples that are at a c 30  discount to peers   by FY20 EBITDA margins are forecast to be broadly in line with peers  although EBIT margins are lower  As the company still has a large proportion of the cash from the sale of TXT Retail  we estimate  50m in net cash by the end of FY19   its P E multiples are inflated versus peers  We expect this premium to reduce as the company makes earnings enhancing acquisitions 


Assioma doubles size of Banking   Finance business
TXT has acquired Assioma  an Italian software testing business  with a completion date of 30 April  Assioma will be consolidated from 1 May 
Deal to cost up to  9 3m
TXT has paid initial cash consideration of  4 3m  It has also put  0 3m cash and treasury shares worth  2 3m in escrow  due for release by end May   for a total initial consideration of  6 9m  The shares are being issued at an agreed value of  8 982 per share  ie 253 846 shares  Contingent consideration of up to  2 4m is payable in two tranches based on the achievement of specific operational goals in the medium term 
Background on Assioma
Assioma was founded 30 years ago by current CEO Giovanni Daniele De Stradis  The business currently has 150 employees based in offices in Bari  Milan and Turin  Customers include banks such as Intesa San Paolo  Unicredit  MI CRDI  Leasing  UBI  ING Direct  Widiba  BPM Group  Allianz  DE ALVG  and AXA  In 2018  the Assioma group generated revenues of  9 4m  EBITDA of  1 3m  13 9  margin  and net income of  0 9m 
Integration plans
Assioma will continue to trade under its own name and be run by Mr De Stradis  Over time  he will develop integration opportunities with TXT s Banking   Finance division  which also provides software testing services into Italian financial institutions 

TXT reported 26 5  y o y growth in group revenues in Q119  Stripping out the  0 9m contributed by Cheleo  acquired in Q318   the business grew 17 3  y o y  Software licenses  subscriptions and maintenance revenues totalled  1 5m  up 31 8  y o y and 13 0  on an organic basis  Services revenues totalled  10 4m  up 25 7  y o y and 17 9  on an organic basis  On a divisional basis  Aerospace  Aviation   Automotive grew 20 3  y o y  all organic  and Banking   Finance grew 49 2   6 6  organic   Total operating costs before depreciation and amortisation increased 28 5  y o y  with R D seeing the largest increase   63  y o y   This resulted in EBITDA increasing at a slower rate of 9 2  y o y and the margin falling from 12 6  to 10 9   TXT reported financial income of  1 278m  Q118   17k  as the investment in multi segment insurance funds was revalued upward during the quarter  This resulted in a net income increase of 162 9  y o y 
Changes to forecasts
Management expects an acceleration in revenue growth in Q219  from organic revenues and the Cheleo and Assioma acquisitions  EBITA is expected to be substantially higher than in Q218 
We have revised our underlying forecasts to reflect the revenues reported in Q119  slightly reducing software revenues but increasing services revenues  and to reflect a higher ongoing level of R D  Within financial income  we have also factored in a  1m upward revaluation of the multi segment insurance fund investments for FY19  The company had previously noted that these suffered a downward revaluation of c  1m in FY18  but had nearly recovered the whole amount in Q119 
We have factored in the Assioma acquisition from 1 May 2019  As TXT expects to record the earnouts as long term debt  we have increased our long term debt forecasts accordingly  Based on our forecasts for FY20  the acquisition doubles the size of the Banking   Finance business and results in margin expansion on a divisional and group basis  We forecast that TXT will have net cash of  50m by the end of FY19  providing a substantial level of funding for further acquisitions in either the Banking   Finance or Aerospace  Aviation   Automotive divisions ",2019-05-16,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/acquiring-italian-software-testing-business-200421896,200421896

179906,401422,TXT,Can Textron  TXT  Be A Suitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Textron Inc    NYSE TXT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Textron has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 26  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 93  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Textron s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 21 35 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Aerospace sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 72  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Textron has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 99  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Textron stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Textron has a P S ratio of about 0 89  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 40x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Textron currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Textron a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Textron is just 1 11  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 70  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  TXT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Textron might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of A  This gives TXT a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no upward revision in the past sixty days compared to three downward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen three up and none down in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 4 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Textron Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTextron is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 22  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Aerospace Defense industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick This Could Be the Fastest Way to Grow Wealth

179943,401459,TXT,Analysts Estimate Textron  TXT  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Textron  TXT  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 17  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 8  
Revenues are expected to be  3 22 billion  down 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 12  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Textron 
For Textron  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 58  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Textron will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Textron would post earnings of  0 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 15  delivering a surprise of  17 35  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Textron doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-textron-txt-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200405549,200405549

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8 57   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters would post earnings of  0 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 15  delivering a surprise of 17 35  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Textron  which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  posted revenues of  3 11 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 33   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 30 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Textron shares have added about 13 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16  
What s Next for Textron 
While Textron has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Textron was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 88 on  3 44 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 67 on  13 95 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Aerospace   Defense is currently in the top 38  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/textron-txt-q1-earnings-surpass-estimates-200407591,200407591
179955,401471,TXT,3 Reasons Why Textron  TXT  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Textron  TXT  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Textron is 8 1   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 9 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9 2  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Textron is 16   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 13 4  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Textron  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Textron a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Textron and Leidos are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that TXT likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than LDOS has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
TXT currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 61  while LDOS has a forward P E of 13 89  We also note that TXT has a PEG ratio of 1 08  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  LDOS currently has a PEG ratio of 1 46 
Another notable valuation metric for TXT is its P B ratio of 2 34  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  LDOS has a P B of 2 85 
Based on these metrics and many more  TXT holds a Value grade of A  while LDOS has a Value grade of C 
TXT stands above LDOS thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that TXT is the superior value option right now ",2019-03-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/txt-vs-ldos-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200400658,200400658
179970,401486,TXT,Is Textron  TXT  A Great Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors use tried and true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment 
One company to watch right now is Textron  TXT   TXT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value  The stock holds a P E ratio of 13 67  while its industry has an average P E of 17 03  Over the past 52 weeks  TXT s Forward P E has been as high as 20 55 and as low as 12 30  with a median of 18 66 
Investors will also notice that TXT has a PEG ratio of 1 09  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  TXT s industry has an average PEG of 1 45 right now  TXT s PEG has been as high as 1 98 and as low as 0 79  with a median of 1 68  all within the past year

180016,401532,TXT,Textron  TXT  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Textron  TXT  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 99 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  33 8  
Revenues are expected to be  3 92 billion  down 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 55  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Textron 
For Textron  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Textron will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Textron would post earnings of  0 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 61  delivering a surprise of  19 74  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Textron doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/textron-txt-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200376663,200376663

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Textron  which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  posted revenues of  3 75 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 37   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 02 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Textron shares have added about 6 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 3  
What s Next for Textron 
While Textron has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Textron was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 70 on  3 37 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 52 on  14 50 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Thursday which  heading into the first week of April the Equity markets are mixed with the ARCA IWM strong but the ARCA SPY and NASDAQ QQQ weaker and maybe ready for some short term downside 
Elsewhere look for Gold to bounce around 1200 as it consolidates while Crude Oil churns back in its consolidation channel  The US Dollar Index should generally move sideways but with an upward bias while US Treasuries are biased lower short term in their consolidation  The Shanghai Composite looks very strong and Emerging Markets are getting jealous  and trying to join it to the upside 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  Their charts point to consolidation or even a downside bias for the SPY and QQQ  while the IWM seem the place to be  holding up well at the all time highs  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

180318,401834,TXT,Danger Zone  Textron  Inc  TXT ,opinion,"From non GAAP accounting to costly acquisitions  it is not difficult for a company to create the illusion of profits  However  eventually reality sets in and the deterioration of a business comes to light  This week s Danger Zone pick  Textron Inc   N TXT   42 share   is destroying shareholder value while covering it up with an acquisition that creates the illusion of profits via GAAP net income growth  The momentum behind this stock will reverse when investors realize this acquisition is not delivering and the business has been in a long term decline 
GAAP Income Doesn t Tell The True Story
From 2013 to the trailing twelve months  TTM   Textron s GAAP net income has grown from  498 million to  666 million  Over the same timeframe  the company s economic earnings  or true earnings available to equity shareholders  have declined from   422 million to   677 million  This discrepancy can be seen in Figure 1 
Figure 1  GAAP Net Income Illusion

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Unfortunately for investors  Textron has failed to earn positive economic earnings in any year in our model  which dates back to 1998  Through the use of accounting loopholes and the shortcomings of GAAP  Textron has been able to present itself as a profitable business despite destroying value the entire way 
The problem with using GAAP net income is that it overlooks almost the entire balance sheet  In 2014  the cost of capital that Textron needs to run its business totaled  1 2 billion  or  4 29 share  After removing this cost from reported earnings we see that Textron s economic EPS were   1 87 compared to GAAP EPS of  2 13 for 2014 
What investors need to realize is that  despite what GAAP numbers are showing  Textron s numerous business lines have not been able to recover from the economic crisis in 2008  In that year  Textron earned a return on invested capital  ROIC  of 8   which has since fallen to a bottom quintile 4  in the TTM  Additionally  Textron s 7  NOPAT margin in 2008 has fallen to 4  over the TTM  With misleading earnings and a deteriorating business  it s clear to see why Textron finds itself on November s Most Dangerous Stocks list 
Textron s Profitability Lags Competitors
Figure 2 shows that Textron s 4  ROIC is much lower than that of its numerous competitors  Because Textron operates as an industrial conglomerate making airplanes  helicopters  golf carts  and automobile parts  it faces competition from a multitude of industries  However many of these competitors operate much more profitably that Textron  This lack of profitability creates a competitive disadvantage  especially when it comes to the stiff pricing competition the company faces 
Figure 2  Textron s Lagging ROIC

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Bull Case Ignores Declining Businesses
Many TXT bulls appear stuck in the mindset that the company can return to its pre recession  glory days   However  not only was this time not as rosy as it may have seemed  as shown by Textron s consistently negative economic earnings  there simply isn t the demand there once was for Textron s multiple products  Through 3Q15  Textron generated 35  of revenues from its Aviation business segment  which includes all its airplane operations  Unfortunately for bulls who believe the company can significantly grow this segment  long term global spending in the business jet market is starting to slow for the first time since 2009  In fact  Honeywell expects shipments over the next decade to decline nearly 4  from the prior decade 
Further compounding bull arguments are that the issues with Textron are not only in its Aviation segment  The companies helicopter division  or Bell segment is not faring any better  The Bell segment represented 25  of revenues through 3Q15  however revenues are down 24  from the first nine months of 2014  Essentially two thirds of Textron s revenues are in industries projected to be in a long term decline  or are already showing signs of decline  Meanwhile  the company s share price would imply quite the opposite  as we ll show below 
Acquisition Destroys Shareholder Value Despite Showing EPS Growth
If we assume that Beech Holdings  LLC  acquired for  1 4 billion in March 2014  has margins equal to Textron s NOPAT margin  the deal only provides a 5  ROIC  which is below the 6  ROIC Textron earned in 2013 and its current weighted average cost of capital  WACC  of 8 58   In other words  despite showing EPS growth post acquisition  the deal destroyed value  This acquisition is another excellent example of the high low fallacy 
Valuation Showing Large Downside Risk
Year to date Textron s stock price is relatively flat and has traded in line with the market  However  shares could have significant downside given just how lofty the expectations built into the stock price have become  To justify its current price of  42 share  Textron must grow NOPAT by 11  compounded annually for the next 16 years  This expectation seems rather optimistic given that over the past 16 years Textron has only managed to grow NOPAT by 1  compounded annually  Even worse  NOPAT has declined by 2  compounded annually over the past three years 
Even if we believe the bull case and assume Textron can increase its historical profit growth six fold and grow NOPAT by 6  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is only worth  21 share today   a 50  downside 
Buyout Seems Unlikely
With highly diversified business operations  it would seem unlikely that a firm would acquire Textron  Not only would the acquirer have to be able to manage operations ranging from airplanes helicopters  defense systems  automobiles  and even lawn maintenance equipment  doing so would be extremely costly  Additionally  Textron s acquisition of Beechcraft has only made a buyout more unattractive  The company s TTM debt of  3 4 billion  29  of market cap   which includes  332 million in off balance sheet operating leases  has increased significantly from  2 4 billion in 2013  Unfortunately  the reason for this large debt increase  the acquisition of Beechcraft  has only resulted in a decline in profits and ROIC  Any potential suitor for Textron would now have to incur a greater debt load for a combined company that is less profitable than it was just two years ago  If any firm were interested in buying Textron  it would be wise to wait for the share price to fall to more realistic levels 
Catalyst  When Mirage of EPS Growth Fades
Struggling clothing retailer Men s Wearhouse  N MW  recently fell over 40  in one day as its quarterly earnings disappointed investors  How is this relevant to Textron you may ask  When we put Men s Wearhouse in the Danger Zone  we noted that its acquisition of Joseph A  Bank could only mask the troubles at the company for so long  and eventually the deterioration of the business would reveal itself  We believe a similar situation could occur in regards to Textron  As revenues began to decline  Textron acquired Beechcraft in mid 2014  which helped prop up 2014 results  in the form of another year of EPS growth  However  as we have shown above  this acquisition has left the company less profitable and more debt laden  not exactly the characteristics of a quality acquisition  When yearly results are reported and the costs of the Beechcraft acquisition are revealed  much like Men s Wearhouse   investors could flee in mass  Couple in the slowing jet market and overall sluggish economy and TXT is certainly not a stock we would want to own 
Insider Sales and Short Interest Remain Low
Over the past 12 months 95 000 shares have been purchased and 74 000 shares have been sold for a net effect of 21 000 insider shares purchased  These sales represent  1  of shares outstanding  Additionally  there are 5 5 million shares sold short  or 2  of shares outstanding 
Executive Compensation Is Misguided
Executives at Textron receive base salaries and short and long term incentive pay in the form of stock units and bonuses  Textron s short term incentives are based upon meeting a target  segment profit  and manufacturing cash flow  Unfortunately these are non GAAP measures  which should immediately raise alarms  In fact  Textron s segment profit removes acquisition and restructuring costs  yet in 2014  Textron acquired Beechcraft for  1 4 billion  Quite convenient to tout revenue and GAAP EPS growth through acquisition and then remove the expenses of that acquisition when it comes time to determine bonuses  Additionally  manufacturing cash flow is determined before pension contributions  pensions that just so happen to be underfunded by  1 4 billion  No matter which way you look at it  Textron s use of non GAAP metrics to determine compensation serves executives  best interests at the expense of shareholders
