3165,224680,AMSF,Aflac  AFL  Hits New 52 Week High  Is Further Upside Left ,opinion,"On May 10  2019  shares of Aflac Inc    NYSE AFL   scaled a 52 week high of  51 36  The rally in the stock is believed to have been due to its sustained profitable operating performance along with a favorable guidance that further points to strong results 
In a year s time  the stock has gained 13  compared with the  s growth of 9   The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Value Score of B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  offer the best opportunities in the value investing space 
The stock has witnessed a 1 8  and 1 1  upward revision in earnings estimates for 2019 and 2020  respectively What s Favoring the Stock Strength in its U S and Japan business has driven revenue growth at Aflac  The company continues to gain from its industry leading market share in both the regions  A diverse and productive distribution network has contributed to the company s premium growth  Innovative products and customized and high quality services have helped it to attract new clients and retain the existing ones A strong capital position along with stable earnings and cash flow provides strength to the company and allows for strategic investments 
Will the Rally Continue 
Last year  Aflac successfully changed its Japan business from a branch to a subsidiary  Japan has been a significant business generator for the company  This change in operating structure better aligns Aflac with the global regulatory framework 
It also recently entered into an agreement with Japan Post per which the latter will buy 7  of the company s shareholding   This deal is expected to drive business expansion in the region  thus aiding overall growth 
The company has suffered from low interest rates in Japan and has changed the product mix to emphasize sale of third sector products  which are less prone to interest rate volatility    
Though Aflac anticipates that in its Japan business  total earned premium of third sector and first sector protection products combined will slightly decline due to limited pay policies reaching paid up status and sales are expected to decline in low to mid single digits for 2019  the long term picture remains bright In its U S business  the company continues to put up a good show  with continuous growth in premiums since past several years  It has undertaken a number of growth initiatives in this segment such as the adoption of Everwell and One Pay Day for increased penetration  delivery of value added services and increased client retention  product partnering to drive improved account values and employee access  and investment in administrative capabilities 
Per the company  investments made in distribution and customer experience will promote increased productivity  persistency  and improved long term economics  In 2019  the company expects  improvement in sales and 2 3  growth in earned premium      
Aflac s strong risk adjusted capital position is another positive  The company has raised dividends for 37 consecutive years and its current yield of 2 2  is higher than the industry average of 0 5   The stock is known as dividend aristocrat and is viewed attractively by dividend seeking investors 
Given that the company s favorable operating performance is likely to continue  we see dividend growth to remain on track   The above factors are expected to fuel Aflac s stock rally

3211,224726,AMSF,4 Solid Insurance Stocks To Hit High Spots In Q4 Bull Market,opinion,Despite the volatile operating environment  with the occurrence of natural calamities  regulatory changes  Federal Reserve s decision as to when hike the interest rate again  there have been quite a few insurance companies which have delivered better than expected results in the third quarter of 2017 Even though the aforementioned challenges are anticipated to impact the upcoming quarter  we remain optimistic about the operational performance of such insurance companies in the near term We will discuss some driving factors that should help insurance companies to perform better in the impending quarter  raising optimism among investors Rising Interest Rates   A Much Awaited Boon to InsurersIf we focus on the life insurance industry  we can identify its connection with interest rates  given the high sensitivity of the players  business models to interest rates  Therefore  life insurance industry s heavy dependence on investment income will benefit most companies from the rising interest rate environment  Thus  rising interest rates as well as increase in bond yields will provide a required relief to insurers to maintain margins Although the Federal Reserve has left the interest rates unchanged  following the Federal Open Market Committee s meeting on Sep 20  2017  ranging between 1  and 1 25   the life insurers are still looking forward to another interest rate hike this year  indicated by policymakers at the meeting  Interestingly  the Fed committee also expects to raise interest rates thrice in 2018  Hence  the overall industry pins hope on the investment income growth in the immediate term  This in turn might also help strengthen its market position A progressing rate environment will lessen the burden on life insurers  investment income  boosting their earnings  This will additionally  accelerate the insurance companies  overall rise in the future Other Aspects Likely to Boost Future PerformanceContinued growth in premiums and a better control over underwriting expenses are anticipated to lend a substantial boost to life insurers  income in the quarter ahead  The individual life insurance premiums  which witnessed modest growth over a considerable period of time  will likely continue the trend with rising demand  driven by an improving job market and the aging population  for retirement savings  Interestingly  life insurers are increasingly moving toward redesigned and re priced products with potential to enhance their liability profiles and profitability in the upcoming quarter Moreover  stronger corporate bonds and improving real estate market might help curtail the credit related investment losses  Also  bettering economy and higher inflation induced bonds look to yield good returns to investors  Life insurers are expected to gain from this favorable trend if it continues in the long run  In fact  a flourishing economy indicates more disposable income with people opting for more insurance coverage Further  the demand for life insurance is estimated to improve and fortify on the back of customers  need for greater safety in a volatile financial environment  Per a recent report by the worldwide insurance association  Life Insurance Management Research Association  LIMRA   minimum 34  of Americans are likely to buy life insurance in 2017  This will in fact encourage demand for life insurance with the industry reaping benefits from such an upside   Key PicksDespite challenging market conditions and evolving customer demands  insurers might gain from improved interest rates and an improving economy that are capable of yielding profits through underlying strength and business modification We zeroed in on four insurers that hold promise to deliver favorable results  banking on a solid price performance and a favorable Zacks Rank backed by positive estimate revisions Duluth  GA based Primerica  Inc    NYSE

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  4 Solid Insurance Stocks to Hit High Spots in Q4 Bull MarketDespite the volatile operating environment  with the occurrence of natural calamities  regulatory changes  Federal Reserve s decision as to when hike the interest rate again  there have been quite a few insurance companies which have delivered better than expected results in the third quarter of 2017 Even though the aforementioned challenges are anticipated to impact the upcoming quarter  we remain optimistic about the operational performance of such insurance companies in the near term We will discuss some driving factors that should help insurance companies to perform better in the impending quarter  raising optimism among investors Rising Interest Rates   A Much Awaited Boon to InsurersIf we focus on the life insurance industry  we can identify its connection with interest rates  given the high sensitivity of the players  business models to interest rates  Therefore  life insurance industry s heavy dependence on investment income will benefit most companies from the rising interest rate environment  Thus  rising interest rates as well as increase in bond yields will provide a required relief to insurers to maintain margins Although the Federal Reserve has left the interest rates unchanged  following the Federal Open Market Committee s meeting on Sep 20  2017  ranging between 1  and 1 25   the life insurers are still looking forward to another interest rate hike this year  indicated by policymakers at the meeting  Interestingly  the Fed committee also expects to raise interest rates thrice in 2018  Hence  the overall industry pins hope on the investment income growth in the immediate term  This in turn might also help strengthen its market position A progressing rate environment will lessen the burden on life insurers  investment income  boosting their earnings  This will additionally  accelerate the insurance companies  overall rise in the future Other Aspects Likely to Boost Future PerformanceContinued growth in premiums and a better control over underwriting expenses are anticipated to lend a substantial boost to life insurers  income in the quarter ahead  The individual life insurance premiums  which witnessed modest growth over a considerable period of time  will likely continue the trend with rising demand  driven by an improving job market and the aging population  for retirement savings  Interestingly  life insurers are increasingly moving toward redesigned and re priced products with potential to enhance their liability profiles and profitability in the upcoming quarter Moreover  stronger corporate bonds and improving real estate market might help curtail the credit related investment losses  Also  bettering economy and higher inflation induced bonds look to yield good returns to investors  Life insurers are expected to gain from this favorable trend if it continues in the long run  In fact  a flourishing economy indicates more disposable income with people opting for more insurance coverage Further  the demand for life insurance is estimated to improve and fortify on the back of customers  need for greater safety in a volatile financial environment  Per a recent report by the worldwide insurance association  Life Insurance Management Research Association  LIMRA   minimum 34  of Americans are likely to buy life insurance in 2017  This will in fact encourage demand for life insurance with the industry reaping benefits from such an upside   Key PicksDespite challenging market conditions and evolving customer demands  insurers might gain from improved interest rates and an improving economy that are capable of yielding profits through underlying strength and business

3215,224730,AMSF,Why The Earnings Streak Will Continue For Amerisafe  AMSF  ,opinion,Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report  Consider Amerisafe  Inc    NASDAQ AMSF    a firm in the Insurance   Accident and Health industry  which could be a great candidate for another beat This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  In fact  in these reports  AMSF has beaten estimates by at least 10  in both cases  suggesting it has a nice short term history of crushing expectations Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago  AMSF expected to post earnings of 72 cents per share  while it actually produced earnings of 82 cents per share  a beat of 13 9   Meanwhile  for the most recent quarter  the company looked to deliver earnings of 77 cents per share  when it actually saw earnings of 87 cents per share instead  representing a 13  positive surprise AMERISAFE  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Thanks in part to this history  recent estimates have been moving higher for Amerisafe  In fact  the  for AMSF is positive  which is a great sign of a coming beat After all  the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus  looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late  suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This is the case for AMSF  as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of  3 43   so another beat could be around the corner This is particularly true when you consider that AMSF has a great Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile  You can see  When you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP  of the time  so it seems pretty likely that AMSF could see another beat at its next report  especially if recent trends are any guide Zacks Editor in Chief Goes  All In  on This Stock Full disclosure  Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other  He believes in its short term profit potential and also in its prospects to more than double by 2019  Today he reveals and explains his surprising move in a new Special Report ,2017-12-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-streak-will-continue-for-amerisafe-amsf-200275796,200275796
3216,224731,AMSF,Is Amerisafe  AMSF  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Amerisafe  Inc    NASDAQ AMSF   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Amerisafe has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 5  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Amerisafe s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 15 5  over the past five years However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers Moreover  we should also point out that Amerisafe has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 18 7  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Amerisafe has a P S ratio of about 3 1  This is marginally lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Amerisafe currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AMSF a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 12 1  which is slightly better than the industry average of 12 4  Clearly  AMSF is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Amerisafe might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives AMSF a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The full year 2017 has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year 2018 estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the full year 2017 consensus estimate has inched up 0 6  in the past two months  while the full year 2018 estimate has risen about 6 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below AMERISAFE  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmerisafe is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  top 4  out of more than 250 industries  and top Zacks Rank  Amerisafe looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks Editor in Chief Goes  All In  on This Stock Full disclosure  Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other  He believes in its short term profit potential and also in its prospects to more than double by 2019  Today he reveals and explains his surprising move in a new Special Report ,2017-12-25,Zacks Investment

3223,224738,AMSF,Aflac  AFL  Hits New 52 Week High  Is More Upside Left ,opinion,"Shares of Aflac Inc    NYSE AFL   scaled a 52 week high of  91 3 on Jan 9  eventually closing a tad lower at  90  The gain is believed to be driven by the positive impact of the recently signed tax reform 
What Aided the Price Rise
The company recently announced that it will invest  250 million in different areas such as employee welfare  business growth and provide support to childhood cancer initiatives 
This development follows the recent passage of the tax reform by Donald Trump  which cuts the corporate tax rate to 21  from 35   Per management  this easy tax regime provides it an opportunity to make investments like the latest one 
Moreover  for its U S workforce  Aflac intends to make better retirement benefits by increasing the company s 401 k  match from 50  to 100  on the first 4  of employee s contribution while making a one time contribution of  500 to every employee s 401 k  plan  It will also offer certain hospital and accident insurance products to all employees free of charge as the company currently does with its core cancer insurance products 
On the business growth front  the company plans to invest in the technology and digital businesses like Empowered   a subsidiary of Aflac 
Share Price Performance
Aflac s stock has gained 29 6  in a year s time  outperforming its  s growth of 21 5  

Is Further Upside Left 
This Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock continues to suffer from 
Conversion Costs  Aflac is in the process of converting its Japan branch into a subsidiary  This  in turn  will enhance its business development flexibility  In fact  the  company has booked approximately  24 million in pretax costs associated with its Japan branch conversion in the first nine months of 2017 
The conversion remains on track and the company expects to incur conversion costs of  120 million to  130 million pretax through mid 2018  These costs will hurt the company s margins in the coming quarters 
Pressure on Business in Japan  Aflac s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment  primarily in Japan  which contributes nearly 70  of the company s revenues  The persistent low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first sector  life insurance  products in the region 
The curtailment of these products as well as weakening of yen has led to a decline in revenues by 0 3  in 2016 and 5 7  in the first nine months of 2017  Going forward  the restriction on sale of first sector products  which carry higher premiums along with currency volatility are further expected to suppress top line growth in the region   
Forex Volatility  The company s significant exposure to Japan makes its vulnerable to foreign currency volatility  Evidently  Aflac s earnings have been hampered by the alarming weakening of the Japanese yen relative to the U S  dollar for the past many years 
While foreign currency adversely impacted bottom line by 34 cents in 2016  the weaker yen dollar exchange rate hurt operating earnings per diluted share by 8 cents in the first nine months of 2017  Currency volatility is expected to continue affecting earnings in the coming quarters 
Overvalued  Aflac s valuation looks stretched at the current level  The company currently has a trailing 12 month price to book  P B  ratio of 1 6  near its highest range  The ratio is also higher than the P B ratio of 1 4 for the industry 
Based on the above mentioned factors  we believe the stock will remain under pressure in the near term

During the most recently reported quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year  driven by favorable performance by its U S  business along with share buyback  The 2017 guidance  earnings per share between  6 40 to  6 65   was also reaffirmed

The company s stock has gained 16  year to date  outperforming the 14  rally of the  it belongs to  Given its favorable 2017 earnings guidance and progress on fundamentals  we expect the stock to continue to perform well in the coming quarters 

Nevertheless  persistent low interest rates in the region have put pressure on revenue growth from Japan business   In order to fight with this  the company has deemphasized sales of first sector  life insurance  products in the region  which has created a dent in revenues from the segment to some extent 
Aflac is in the process of converting its Japan branch into a subsidiary  which will provide it enhanced business flexibility  The company expects to incur conversion costs of  120 million to  130 million pretax through mid 2018  These costs will hurt the company s margins in the coming quarters 
Given that the company derives almost 70  of total revenues from Japan  it is greatly exposed to foreign currency volatility  A weaker yen hurt second quarter results by 2 cents a share when compared to the year ago quarter  Its pre tax hedge cost guidance remains in the  250  270 million range for 2017  These costs will put pressure on the company s bottom line

3258,224773,AMSF,Brexit May Delay Rate Hike  6 Insurance Stocks To Stay Safe,opinion,"Britain s unprecedented decision to leave the European Union  EU   the world s biggest trading block  has shaken the global financial markets  The result of the voting  which calls for U K  exiting the EU after being with it for more than four decades  saw the resignation of British Prime Minister David Cameron and sent indices all over the world crashing The Brexit event has flagged political and economic chaos in Europe  The domino effect of it may hurt the already fragile world economy and the spillover effect across the pond can be in the form of reduced earnings for U S  companies with large exposure to the U K Will Brexit Put a Brake on Fed s Interest Rate Decision     One of the side effects of Brexit is that it will most likely delay the next interest rates hike by the Federal Reserve  The Brexit event caused the pound falling to its lowest level in 30 years and even Euro saw a decline against the U S  dollar  The uncertainty induced by Brexit and the strengthening dollar may compel the Federal Reserve to delay its plans to raise short term interest rates  A strong U S  dollar hurts exports and makes imports cheaper  thereby widening the trade deficit 
Also  continued appreciation of the dollar can flare up global market volatility  Moreover  a strong dollar can prompt China to weaken its currency  yuan  as it had done before  Earlier  yuan weakness had caused global market volatility which held back the Fed from hiking rates After a no show at the June meeting  it now looks highly unlikely that the interest rates will be moved northward in the subsequent meetings at least until it becomes clearer how events in Europe will affect the U S  economy  Fed policy makers  projection of four hikes in 2016 has been pushed off the board till the global financial markets settle down  Traders are even considering chances of an interest rate cut by the Fed but the possibility of it remains too low How Will Insurers Tackle Low Rates     Low interest rates affect earnings and liquidity of the insurers and hence pose a threat to the insurance industry  Since investment income forms an important revenue component of insurers  a low interest rate compresses yields which in turn lowers investment income  Looking at it the other way  since insurance companies hold a large percentage of bonds in their investment portfolio  low interest rates cause an appreciation in the value of invested bonds 
Moreover  insurers have managed to guard themselves against low rates by asset liability matching  Also  a broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes have provided some cushion amid low rates  though the results are way below their historic highs While insurers have learnt to grapple with low interest rates  they have also been enjoying a low  catastrophe environment which has reduced their claims  costs and increased their reserves  making them fundamentally strong U S Insurers Least Exposed to the U KThe U S insurance industry is one of the sectors with the least exposure to the U K  market  So Brexit and its ills will have minimum impact on insurers   Some of the biggies like UnitedHealth Group  Inc    NYSE UNH    Prudential Financial Inc    NYSE PRU    The Travelers Companies  Inc    NYSE TRV    Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   and Aflac Inc    NYSE AFL   are some of the S P 500 companies with less than 0 25  of their revenues coming from the U K Some Insurers that Can Weather the Brexit StormAt a time when investors  decisions have been blurred by intense market volatility  choosing stocks in the insurance sector will ensure returns to one s portfolio  We therefore pick some stocks from this space based on a solid   Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Moreover  these stocks are backed by a favorable Zacks Rank  an attractive price to earnings  P E  ratio and positive earnings surprises over the past four quarters Amerisafe  Inc    NASDAQ AMSF   is a specialty provider of workers  compensation insurance that markets and underwrites insurance through its subsidiaries  Amerisafe has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a VGM Score of B  Its expected earnings growth is 8 8  for the current year  The forward P E ratio is 14 7  which is lower than the industry average of 16 1  The company beat estimates over the last four quarter by an average 25 9   Notably  the stock has witnessed upward estimate revisions over the last 60 days Employers Holdings  Inc    NYSE EIG   operates in the commercial property and casualty insurance industry primarily in the United States  The company provides workers  compensation insurance to small businesses in low to medium hazard industries  It has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a VGM Score of B  Its expected earnings growth is 5 9  for the current year  The forward P E ratio is 11 6  which is lower than the industry average of 16 1  The company delivered positive surprises in the last four quarters  with an average beat of 51 3  Argo Group International Holdings  Ltd    NASDAQ AGII   underwrites specialty insurance and reinsurance products in the property and casualty market  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Score of B  Its expected earnings growth is 5 9  for the current year  The forward P E ratio is 14 2  which is lower than the industry average of 16 1  The company beat estimates over the last four quarter by an average 11 9  AmTrust Financial Services  Inc    NASDAQ AFSI   through its subsidiaries  underwrites and provides property and casualty insurance in the United States and internationally  It has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and a VGM Score of A  Its expected earnings growth is 6 8  for the current year  The forward P E ratio is 7 9  which is lower than the industry average of 16 1  Over the last four quarters  the company beat estimates by an average 14 6  The Hanover Insurance Group  Inc    NYSE THG   through its subsidiaries  provides various property and casualty insurance products and services in the United States and internationally  It has a Zacks Rank  3 and a VGM Score of A  Its expected earnings growth is 0 8  for the current year  The forward P E ratio is 12 9  which is lower than the industry average of 16 1  The company s average beat for the last four quarters is 11 4  Headquartered in Chattanooga  TN  Unum Group   NYSE UNM   provides disability insurance  long term care insurance  life insurance  employer  and employee paid group benefits and related services  Unum Group has a Zacks Rank  3 and a VGM Score of A  The company has expected earnings growth of 2 8  for the current year  The forward P E ratio is 8 4  which is lower than the industry average of 16 1 Unum Group delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 1 9  ",2016-06-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/brexit-may-delay-rate-hike:-6-insurance-stocks-to-stay-safe-200138491,200138491

3281,224796,AMSF,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Amerisafe  EHealth  Hallmark Financial Services  United Insurance Holdings And Universal American,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   May 05  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Insurance  including Amerisafe  Inc     NASDAQ AMSF     eHealth  Inc     NASDAQ EHTH     Hallmark Financial Services Inc     NASDAQ HALL     United Insurance Holdings Corp     NASDAQ UIHC    and Universal American Corp     NYSE UAM    

Industry  Insurance

Link  

The Federal Reserve raising interest rates for the first time in seven years in Dec 2015 generated optimism about the prospects of the U S  insurance industry  as it is one of the very few to thrive in a rising interest rate environment  A rising rate environment typically benefits insurers as their investment strategies are liability driven 

However  the recent questions surrounding how far and how fast the Fed will hike rates  following its dovish stance so far this year  are making it difficult for the industry to predict benefits  Particularly  the near term impact of the only hike so far   which was only a quarter percentage point   on the insurance sector will be limited  It is actually not enough for insurers to be confident of pricing changes 
	On the other hand  many insurers have changed their asset allocation strategies in an effort to minimize the impact of the prolonged low rate environment on their business  Moving beyond their traditional holdings  they choose to invest in illiquid assets for increased returns  As a result  they are not prepared to reap the benefits of rising rates 
	Although the only rate hike  so far  doesn t bring much immediate relief for insurers  the Fed will hike rates further  either in predictable fashion or not  And a rising rate environment will surely brace insurers  business sooner or later 
	But the business dynamics of insurers are not that simple  and the relationship of profit with the interest rate is not direct either 
	In particular  Property   Casualty  P C  insurance  which is not very sensitive to the interest rate environment  holds a significant amount of bonds  which would fall in value with interest rates rising steadily  which is very unlikely  though   This will lead to capital volatility in the industry 
	However  a rising rate environment would keep alleviating the pressure on P C insurers  investment income  and thus their earnings  Moreover  a higher rate environment would make the pricing environment more competitive  further supporting carriers to grow 
	Life insurers  however  depend heavily on investment income  so they will benefit more from a rising rate environment  There will be relief from operating pressures resulting from tight credit spreads that the low rate environment has exerted for so long  However  the benefit is expected to be modest as life insurers have significantly reduced their interest sensitive product lines in the prolonged low rate environment 
	No matter how the changing interest rate environment impacts insurers  mild catastrophe losses and continued influx of capital are expected to keep most lines of P C insurance favorable for buyers  Yet evolving threats such as cyber attacks and a persistently soft market pose challenges for the carriers 
	On the other hand  containment of underwriting expenses and a modest increase in premiums are shoring up the prospects of life insurers 

With glaring dissimilarity in business dynamics  it makes better sense to look at the prospects of these two key segments of the U S  insurance space separately  read our subsequent posts for a detailed insight  
	Here is how the overall insurance market looks 
	While continued economic uncertainty across the globe is not leaving the U S  totally unscathed  domestic economic progress makes the backdrop stronger for the country s insurers  Particularly  given the possibility of the interest rates raising at least twice this year  insurers might see some improvement in their rate sensitive business 
	Moreover  a strong liquidity profile by virtue of continued capital inflow into the industry  ample capacity  conservative product design and evolving coverage will not only limit any downside but will also keep the growth trend alive  Also  the ongoing reserve development will continue to support insurers  financials 
	Increasing insurance literacy through initiatives like The Insurance Consumer Bill of Rights should help the industry witness rising demand for products  Increasing demand from economically recuperating American households should eventually place insurers in a favorable pricing cycle  too 
	Further  recovery in underwriting and a lower combined ratio for P C insurers are expected to continue if the trend of modest catastrophe losses prevails  Then again  lower catastrophe losses indicate lower premium rates as well 
	Moreover  heightened competition might curb insurers  profitability in the quarters ahead  But the rapid influx of alternative capital will keep the prices down and expedite M A activities Regulation Yet To Be Effective 
	Apparently  a safe and sleepy business nature keeps U S  insurers out of federal regulations  which could have marred business expansion  But the industry has yet to be strongly braced by the advantages of operating under state run regulations  Instead  decentralized regulation and consumer protection make the industry susceptible to insolvency 
	Now  the changing nature of business    more like banks in terms of liabilities    perhaps calls for federal oversight  Though the necessity for a regulatory revamp has been strongly felt after banks witnessed success  this would deliver another blow to the insurance industry 
	A provision of the 2010 Dodd Frank Act requires setting minimum capital and leverage standards on insurance companies  but these have yet to be implemented by U S  lawmakers  who are considering the distinct business fundamentals different from banks  But the industry  which is increasingly contributing to GDP  has scant chance of being relieved of Federal Reserve control for very long Zacks Industry Rank
	Within the Zacks Industry classification  insurers are broadly grouped in the Finance sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  and are further sub divided into five industries at the expanded  aka  X   level  P C  Multiline  Accident   Health  Life and Brokers  The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry 
	We rank 265 X industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry 
	We put our X industries into two groups  the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1   To learn more visit   
	The Zacks Industry Rank is  9 for Accident   Health   35 for Brokers   113 for P C   180 for Life and  195 for Multiline Earnings Trends
	As of April 27  54 5  S P 500 companies in the broader Finance sector  of which the Insurance industry is a medium level  or M level  component  reported first quarter 2016 results  The earnings beat ratio  percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises  is 64 6   while the revenue beat ratio came in at 56 3  
	The sector is expected to witness year over year earnings decline of 2 4  compared with a 0 5  increase recorded in the prior quarter  Revenues are however expected to show a year over year improvement of 2 1  compared with the prior quarter s growth of 2 7  
	For a detailed look at the earnings trend for this sector and others  please read our latest  report Bottom Line
	Looking at the broader trends  the overall health of the industry appears to be improving despite the emergence of new issues  And learning from past experience  insurers are resorting to expense saving measures to tread water 
	If insurers manage to overcome the short term resistance that may be holding back premium rate increases  they should ultimately witness margin expansion  Also  in the absence of federal regulation  insurers can take on new challenges with the ample capital that they now have How to Play the Insurance Sector
	As you can see  apart from the expected benefits from a rising rate environment sooner or later  there are plenty of other reasons to be optimistic about the industry s prospects  So it would be prudent to pick a few insurance stocks that might outperform the markets in the near term 
	We highly recommend stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  such as Amerisafe  Inc     NASDAQ AMSF     eHealth  Inc     NASDAQ EHTH    and Hallmark Financial Services Inc      NASDAQ HALL    
	However  we suggest staying away from or getting rid of Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stocks such as United Insurance Holdings Corp     NASDAQ UIHC    and Universal American Corp     NYSE UAM

3282,224797,AMSF,Make The Most Of May   Safe  Gains Hiding In Plain Sight,opinion,"May has finally arrived  and is once again wreaking havoc on investors 
We ve all heard the old adage  Sell in May and Go Away   So far  the market hasn t disappointed the folks who propagate it 
Right now  the S P 500 Index is down about 2   and its chart is pointing towards a further downturn before the month is done 
And you ll recall that the index  which fell more than 10  to start the year  has only recently recovered from the decline 
Well  forget about seasonality  This pullback is exactly what the market needs after two months of scorching gains 
Here s how you can trade the dip with momentum behind you 
The Laggards Now Lead
After leading the market for most of this seven year bull market  growth stocks are taking it on the chin this year as earnings fail to justify lofty valuations 
Investors are rotating out of growth and into cheaper equities 
As a result  value stocks   which have underperformed the market over the same period   have risen from the dead 
The S P 500 Value Index is up 2 5  on the year versus a decline of 1 5  for the large cap growth index 
And there s plenty of value in the market  That is  if you know where to look 
Rising Rates Will Lift These Boats
The financial sector holds some of the deepest value in the stock market today 
Years of record low interest rates around the world have choked bank profits and kept a tight lid on stock performance 
Over the last 10 years  large cap financials have declined 31  while the broader market gained 59  
But now  financial stocks sport a valuation that s too low to ignore 
At 14 8 times earnings  the sector trades at a 22  discount to the S P 500   the largest of all 10 sectors 
And if the Federal Reserve follows through with an interest rate hike next month  these stocks won t be this cheap for much longer 
As you may know  financial stocks perform well in a rising interest rate environment 
Net interest margins   the difference between the interest that an institution earns from loans and interest paid out to depositors   increase as rates go up  The higher the margin  the larger the profit 
With a possible hike on the horizon  this could be your best chance to seize upon the sector s weakness  before the rest of the market catches on 
A Safe Way to Play
Amerisafe Inc   NASDAQ AMSF  is a leading American insurance holding company 
Licensed in 47 states and the District of Columbia  the company provides workers  compensation insurance to hazardous industries  like construction and manufacturing 
Propelled by outstanding earnings growth  Amerisafe shares have gained 161  over the last five years 
That s more than triple the gain of the S P 500 over the same period 
Despite the impressive rise  shares still trade at just 13 1 times forward earnings   a slight premium to its peers but 31  below the benchmark index 
Amerisafe s chart paints an even more attractive picture 

As you can see  shares just broke through an ascending triangle pattern to set a new all time high 
One of the most bullish chart patterns out there  an ascending triangle pattern indicates that in the face of overhead resistance  demand for a stock is on the rise 
Going all the way back to January  the stock s rising support line has gone unbroken for the last five months 
Furthermore  the stock hasn t closed below its 200 day moving average in nearly a year   a key indicator of long term support 
The increased demand this year gave shares the boost they needed to break through the resistance around  52 85 
And stocks making new highs  especially all time highs  entices investors looking to buy into established momentum 
This greatly increases the likelihood that the bullish trend will continue 
Best of all  the recent pullback in stocks this month has helped carve out an even nicer entry point for new buyers 
Now s the time to buy the dip  and trade the trend of one of the year s hottest value stocks 
On the hunt ",2016-05-06,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/make-the-most-of-may:-“safe”-gains-hiding-in-plain-sight-200128405,200128405
3287,224802,AMSF,Looking For Earnings Growth  These 5 Stocks Have The Trait ,opinion,"Regardless of the fact whether it is a fledgling company or an established corporation  consistent earnings growth is what everyone looks for  This is because earnings serve as the indicator of a company s profitability  If the company fails to generate enough money  it will eventually run out of gas in the long run 
This metric is also considered to be the most significant variable in influencing the share price  Better than expected earnings performances more often than not lead to an increase in the share price 
Earnings Estimates for Determining Stock Price Movements
On many occasions  we have seen the stock price declining despite earnings growth  while on the other hand  the stock price is sometimes found to be soaring following an earnings decline  In such cases  earnings estimate revisions might have come into play  The stock price is determined based on expectations that analysts have on the future earnings power of the firm 
Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost controls  Thus  earnings estimates are a valuable tool for investors when deciding whether or not to buy a stock 
Hence  it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and also whose quarterly and annual earnings estimates are on the rise 
Screening Parameters
In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions  we added the following parameters 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only Zacks   Buys  and  Strong Buys  are allowed  With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there  this is a great way to start things off  
5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry  Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history 
  Change EPS F 0  F  1  greater than or equal to 5  Companies that witnessed year over year earnings growth rate of 5  or more in the last reported fiscal year 
  Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero  Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks 
  Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero  Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week 
  Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero  Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks 
The above criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7 740 stocks to only 8  Here are the top 5 stocks 
Honeywell International Inc     NYSE HON   
Newell Brands Inc     NYSE NWL   
Casey s General Stores  Inc

According to Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   there is a decent chance it will raise rates in July    Goldman Sachs estimates 35  chance of a rate increase in July with 35  chance that the same may materialize in September But even if these do not translate into a rate hike  the insurance sector has no such reason to panic  This is because insurers hold a considerable amount in bonds  which would see a decline in value if rates rise  A low interest rate environment thus is not all bad news for insurers   Nonetheless  interest rate has a direct impact on investment results of insurers  A low rate thus puts pressure on investment income and investment yield  Notably  investment income forms a major revenue component of insurers  Life insurers  in particular  suffer spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to sustained low rates However  a broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes have to some extent cushioned investment results in the low interest rate environment  Though investment performance remains far from their historic highs  yet investment income and yields have been exhibiting improvement 3 Insurance Stocks with Winning PotentialAmid all the looming uncertainty  the insurance industry seems somewhat insulated by its fundamental strength  Operators from the accident and health  A H  insurance industry in particular are well positioned with a rock solid industry rank of 5  This falls on the upper end of the top 1 3 tier of our Industry Rank leading to a clear positive outlook for the industry We have picked some solid operators from the space that have the potential to boost one s portfolio even more  We refine our search using the   a solid Zacks Rank  and attractive price to earnings  P E    Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Also  these stocks posted average positive earnings surprises over the past four quarters Headquartered in Columbus  GA  Aflac Inc    NYSE AFL    through its subsidiary   American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus   provides supplemental health and life insurance   Aflac Financial has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and a VGM Score of B  The company has expected earnings growth of 5  for the current year  The forward P E ratio is 10 3  Aflac delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 4 1   Notably  the stock has been witnessing upward estimate revisions over the last 60 days Headquartered in DeRidder  LA  Amerisafe Inc    NASDAQ AMSF   is a specialty provider of workers  compensation insurance  which markets and underwrites insurance through its subsidiaries  Amerisafe has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a VGM Score of B  Its expected earnings growth is 8 8  for the current year  The forward P E ratio is 15 7  which is lower than the industry average of 16 5  The company delivered positive surprises in the last four quarters  with an average beat of 25 9   Notably  the stock has witnessed upward estimate revisions over the last 60 days Headquartered in Chattanooga  TN  Unum Group   NYSE UNM   provides disability insurance  long term care insurance  life insurance  employer  and employee paid group benefits and related services  Unum Group has a Zacks Rank  3 and a VGM Score of A  The company has expected earnings growth of 4 7  for the current year  The forward P E ratio is 9 1  Unum Group delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 1 9   The stock has seen estimates being revised upward over the last 60 days ",2016-06-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-rock-steady-insurers-in-an-erratic-market-200135924,200135924
3293,224808,AMSF,Buy These 5 Stocks With Recent Price Strength,opinion,In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price However  finding a win win strategy is easier said than done  In the current highly volatile market  it is difficult for even an ardent investor to come up with a foolproof approach One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  But this bears the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could be stuck in the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in the selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Here s how to execute it One should primarily look for stocks that have recently been witnessing a price increase  Actually  stocks backed by recent price strength have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously moving higher  there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen or remained stable  So  looking at stocks that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set themselves sounds rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create magic  so you need to set other relevant parameters for a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners Screening Parameters Percentage Change in Price  4 Weeks  greater than zero  This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage Change Price  12 Weeks  greater than 10  This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether the market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance Average Broker Rating 1  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock s future performance Current Price greater than 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Current Price  52 Week High Low Range more than 85   This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52 week highs  It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through this screen Entercom Communications Corp    NYSE ETM   is the fourth largest radio

3297,224812,AMSF,5 Great Stocks With Powerful Net Profit Margin,opinion,Profit margin is a great metric to gauge the success of a business  A proper analysis of this metric reveals how well a company is run and or what are its headwinds Net profit margin is the most effective way to measure a company s profitability  It is derived by deducting all operating and non operating expenses as well as income tax payable to the government from revenues Net Profit Margin   Net profit  Sales   100 In other words  net profit margin calculates net profit of a company for each dollar of sales Net Profit Margin  Pros   ConsNet profit margin gives us a glimpse into the company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Therefore  a proper analysis of net profit margin discloses how efficiently a company is running its business and controlling costs However  net profit margin has a number of flaws that limit its scope as an effective analytical tool  Its calculation widely varies from industry to industry  Difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes it a difficult metric for the purpose of comparison Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt  instead of equity funding  higher interest expense usually drags down the net profit  In such cases  it is not an effective tool to analyze the company s performance The Right StrategyIn most of the times  a healthy net profit translates into solid earnings per share  EPS   which is the single most important metric that defines a well run business  Indeed  healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are two of the most sought after ingredients in a business model Apart from these two metrics  we have added a few additional criteria to ensure maximum possible return from this strategy Screening ParametersNet Margin 12 months   Most Recent     greater than equal to 0  High net profit margin

3301,224816,AMSF,Is It Time To Buy Amerisafe ,opinion,"On Nov 12  Zacks Investment Research upgraded AMERISAFE Inc  NASDAQ AMSF   by a notch to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  from a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Why the Upgrade 
Amerisafe witnessed appreciation in earnings estimates on the back of a better growth outlook and underwriting experience  A steady improvement in underwriting experience is also indicative of higher premiums and disciplined expense management  Notably  expense  loss  combined and underwriting ratios improved in the first nine months of 2014 
Moreover  Amerisafe s strong investment portfolio and incremental cash flows  along with favorable frequency trends and attractive pricing  raises optimism about management s financial objective to produce ROE of at least 15  over the long term  from 11 3  at Sep 2014 end   while maintaining optimal operating leverage in its insurance subsidiaries 
Additionally  the company declared a second extraordinary cash dividend payout of  1 00 per share in Oct 2014 thereby raising investor confidence 
On Oct 29  Amerisafe reported third quarter earnings per share  EPS  of 72 cents  which outshone the year ago quarter by 33 3  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 8   Additionally  this workers  compensation insurer has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 19 6  
Upward estimate revisions on the stock reflect optimism regarding its prospects  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 2014 and 2015 moved north by 1 6  and 1 0  to  2 61 and  3 10 per share  respectively  following the third quarter earnings release  On a year over year basis  EPS is expected to escalate by about 10  in 2014 and 19  in 2015  With no downward estimate revision  this indicates a likely earnings beat for both the years
