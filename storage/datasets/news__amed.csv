24033,245548,AMED,Year Of The Rat Spells Good Times For Wall Street  5 Picks,opinion,If Chinese zodiac interests you  then you might want to know that the calendar will soon change from the Year of the Pig to the Year of the Rat  But does that also mean a change in the performance of the U S  stock market  After all  the Year of the Pig  mostly considered to be a symbol of fortune and opulence  has been favorable for the U S  stock market  In fact  U S  stocks scaled north during the period  defying skeptics who expected the bull market to be upended by trade war threats and global economic slowdown  While the broader stock market  as predominantly measured by the S P 500 rallied almost 30  last year  it seems to be gaining momentum this year as well But  will Year of the Rat bring good tidings as well  Historically  during the Year of the Rat  the S P 500 s performance has been slightly better than the index s overall average of 11 4   according to Stansberry Pacific Research    What s more  there is an array of positive factors that should help the U S  stock market continue its upward journey  The Trump administration s recent phase one trade deal with China will lessen the burden on global economic growth created by trade imbalances  Lest we forget  the United States and China together account for 35  to 40  of the world s economy  and thus have a significant influence on international growth  And since the negotiations have gone well between the countries  business confidence will improve  driving capital expenditure and in turn stocks Consumer outlays have also remained healthy  led by record low unemployment rate and wage gains  and should certainly help the economy expand this year  Per the Commerce Department  consumer outlays increased 0 3  in December from a month earlier  At the same time  retail sales for the November December period increased 4 1  to  730 2 billion  added the National Retail Federation  All these indicate that households have enough spending capabilities to keep the economy expanding at a steady pace in the near term By the way  the current low interest environment should make borrowing manageable helping companies invest and grow  This in turn should help the economy gain momentum  To top it  the Fed is expected to keep its monetary policy on hold after trimming rates three consecutive times last year to stimulate the economy  Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said that there is no immediate need to hike the federal fund s rate unless there is a constant rise in inflation Some skeptics  meanwhile  may say that the recent spread of a contagious disease in China may weigh heavily on stocks  But China s efforts to control the viral outbreak and the World Health Organization s decision to refrain from declaring China s coronavirus outbreak a global emergency bolstered investors  sentiments 5 Biggest GainersGiven the bullishness  investing in stocks that can make the most of the Year of the Rat seems judicious  We

24045,245560,AMED,Job Additions Top 2 Million Mark Again In 2019  5 Winners,opinion,December s job additions took total job creation in the United States to more than 2 million last year  With this  job additions crossed the 2 million mark for nine years on the trot Particularly in December  total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 145 000  per the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS   Despite slower economic growth and a slump in manufacturing last year  hiring remained steady and unemployment continued to be at a record low level Where Were the Jobs Added The protracted U S  China trade war has hit manufacturers and the sector added merely 46 000 jobs in 2019  which is far less than 264 000 jobs added in 2018  However  three sectors that played a big role in achieving the 2 million mark are healthcare  leisure and hospitality  and retail Per the BLS report  the healthcare sector added 28 000 jobs in December particularly in ambulatory healthcare services and hospitals  Overall  the sector added 399 000 jobs in 2019 compared to 350 000 job additions in 2018 Factors that boosted the healthcare space in 2019  primarily includes developments in biotech space  research and drugs in pipeline  and mega mergers  Additionally  two major events  vaping and measles outbreak also impacted the sector  Vaping had been a serious concern across the United States with more than 2 400 peopled hospitalized with lung injuries  The measles epidemic in 2019 affected more than 1 200 people   the largest reported number since 1992 Leisure and retail sectors  on the other hand  received a boost from robust consumer spending  Per the Commerce Department  consumer outlays increased 0 4  in November  its strongest gain since July  Consumer sentiment in fact was high due to a low unemployment rate that helped them spend more in the holiday season and throughout the year The leisure and hospitality sector added 40 000 jobs in December  The industry notched 388 000 jobs in 2019  higher than 2018 s 359 000 job additions  Meanwhile  the retail sector added 41 000 jobs in December  with 33 000 new hiring across clothing and accessories stores and 7 000 in building material and

24048,245563,AMED,Invest In These 5 Low Leverage Stocks Before Q4 Earnings,opinion,Leverage is a well known business strategy to use borrowed funds for financing the purchase of inventory  equipment and other company assets  These funds can also be utilized to repay the company s prior debt  Companies can obtain such funds either using debt or equity Among equity and debt  the two most common options used to boost a company s future earnings  the latter is the more popular one  This is perhaps due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing In fact  statistics indicate that the United States  the richest economy in the world  is the biggest borrower  Notably  huge spending on wars  big tax cuts and stimulating economic programs have all added to the nation s burden over the years  The Congressional Budget Office projects federal debt to rise to 92  of the economy s GDP in 2029 from 78  in 2019 Nevertheless  this should not discourage investors from spending on U S  stocks since debt has been part of the economy since its foundation and yet the country leads others  What investors need to do is choose stocks with caution  thus avoiding the ones that carry high debt load Therefore  the debt level of a company is an important point of consideration while making an investment decision The next question is how to measure a company s degree of financial leverage  To this end  several leverage ratios have been constructed as efficient tools to evaluate a company s credit level to support prudent equity investments  The most popular among them is debt to equity ratio Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company With the Q4 reporting cycle coming up  an investor must be looking for stocks that performed well in earlier quarters  However  companies displaying high earnings growth along with high leverage ratios are not the ideal investment choices  So  investors should select companies with low leverage than high earnings growth The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1 or 2   Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 24 stocks

24050,245565,AMED,Invest In These 5 Stocks With Solid Relative Price Strength,opinion,Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock s ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average If a stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always proves to be lucrative Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains

Driehaus used the  buy high and sell higher  rule to create an investment approach  which appeals to those having a high level of risk appetite  Investors principally invest in momentum stocks using the Driehaus strategy  The success of this investment approach eventually helped Richard Driehaus make a place in Barron s All Century Team The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer higher than market returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed based on the Driehaus strategy  has returned more than 300  since the end of the last bear market compared with 85 5  gains registered by the S P 500 A Look at Driehaus  StrategyAfter a detailed study of the Driehaus  strategy  AAII concluded that it mainly focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive prospects to pick potential outperformers  While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul  companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance  I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   Driehaus had said in an interview Screening ParametersIn addition to the 50 day moving average and relative strength  we have considered a few some parameters for picking the best stocks  As companies with a strong history of beating estimates usually outperform the market  we added this to our screen  Also  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a  of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside

burgeoning middle class  insatiable demand for new drugs and ever escalating health care spending have been some of the key catalysts in 2019 and will keep fueling the sector Players in the sector

24142,245657,AMED,Add These 5 Stocks With Amazing Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,You can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged with coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we have discussed one such ratio called interest coverage ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time What s the Strategy Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest coverage ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market

24166,245681,AMED,Amedisys  Six Flags Entertainment  Target  Walmart And Disney Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 19  2019    Shares of Amedisys   NASDAQ AMED   as the Bull of the Day  Six Flags Entertainment   NYSE SIX   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Target   NYSE TGT    Walmart   NYSE WMT   and Disney   NYSE DIS   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Amedisys is a company that provides home health and hospice services throughout the U S  It offers clinically focused programs for conditions like diabetes  congestive heart failure  orthopedics  and various rehabilitative programs  as well as hospice services to patients using an interdisciplinary care team Q3 Earnings ImpressAmedisys  bottom line surged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate  non GAAP earnings of  1 15 per share increased 21  year over year  Revenue of  495 million came in line with our consensus and grew  18 5  from the prior year period The Home Health segment  which is the company s biggest revenue generator  hit  311 5 million  up 5 6  year over year  Hospice jumped 57  year over year  while Personal Care increased 9  to  20 7 million  All three of our lines of business continue to grow  we have made great progress integrating the Compassionate Care acquisition  and most importantly  we are once again near the top of the industry in quality for both Home Health and Hospice   said CEO and president Paul B  Kusserow Year to date  AMED is up 32   Estimates have been rising lately too  pushing the stock towards a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  For the current fiscal year  Amedisys  earnings is expected to grow about 21  year over year  Eight analysts have revised their estimate upwards in the past 60 days  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped 23 cents higher from  4 16 to  4 39 per share during the same time frame 2020 looks strong too  and earnings could see growth of 10 4   next year s consensus estimate sits at  4 85 per share  with six upward revisions in the last 60 days Bottom LineLooking ahead  Amedisys expects fiscal 2019 revenue to fall in the range of  1 94 billion and  1 98 billion  and adjusted EPS for the full year to come in between  4 32 and  4 39 per share Because there can be uncertainty when investing in healthcare stocks  management urged  caution in considering the current trends and 2019 guidance   Amedisys operates in a very competitive space  and an industry that is subject to heavy regulation  Despite intense market fluctuations this year  AMED has proven that it has been able to grow its key business segments  If you re an investor looking for a broad healthcare stock to add to your portfolio  make sure to keep AMED on your shortlist  Six Flags Entertainment owns and operates regional theme parks  offering guests rides  water attractions  concerts  shows  restaurants  game venues and retail outlets  The company also holds long term licenses for certain Warner Bros  and DC Comic characters like Bugs Bunny and Batman Shares Tumble After Disappointing Q3 EarningsLast month  Six Flags reported underwhelming earnings for its fiscal 2019 third quarter  Q3 comprises its peak period too  so investors were doubly disappointed  Earnings of  2 11 per share lagged behind the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 30  Revenue managed to grow 1  year over year to  621 2 million  but fell well below what analysts were expecting Spending per guest was down 1  because of higher attendance from its Active Pass base  and revenue from sponsorships  accommodations  and international agreements dropped 26   One bright note in the quarter was its membership program  however  Even though it pushed down per guest spending  Q3 s attendance showed that Active Pass is boosting guest visit totals As a result  shares tumbled almost 12  after the report was released  And  SIX is down over 17  year to date Analysts have since turned bearish on Six Flags  with nine cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped 16 cents during that same time period from  2 78 to  2 62 per share  This sentiment has stretched into 2020  and our consensus estimate has fallen 19 cents in the past two months SIX is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Looking AheadManagement didn t provide guidance in the earnings press release  but the fact that Six Flags struggled to generate meaningful growth in its key quarter 40  of revenue comes from the third quarter may not be a great sign  especially as consumer spending is strong right now Additional content Target  TGT  Q3 Earnings On Deck  Can It Reach New Highs Target is set to report its third quarter performance before the opening bell on Wednesday  November 20  The retailer has seen its shares rise over 69  in 2019 and is currently trading around 2  below its 52 week high of  114 83 Target has focused on expanding its digital presence  which will make its e commerce figures imperative in the upcoming report  Wall Street will also look to Target s guidance for the vital holiday shopping period Digital Sales Drive GrowthTarget posted an impressive Q2 performance  with comparable digital sales up 34  to account for 7 3  of total sales  Nearly one third of these sales came from same day services  in store pickup  Drive Up  and Shipt  The uptick in these digital options shows how Target is using digital commerce to improve the profitability of physical stores CEO Brian Cornell was pleased with the performance and stated  These are remarkable statistics  and they demonstrate how rapidly our guests are learning about and embracing these new convenient options   Wall Street and investors will be looking for these digital channels to continue their remarkable growth and for consumers to continue to adopt these new ways of shopping Target also reports after its main competitor  Walmart  posted its Q3 results that highlighted strong operating metrics in its core US segment  This could put pressure on TGT as investors expect a strong report to assure them that Target isn t giving up any ground to Walmart Outlook Target s same day services are expected to continue to bolster the company s bottom line but some are worried about the sustainability of the model  Some investors feel that the services will only be sustainable while the number of orders being fulfilled is still relatively small  Wall Street will look for updates on the success of the supply chain fulfillment and how management plans to handle the growth In preparation for the busiest shopping season of the year  Target is spending  50 million more on payroll during the fourth quarter than it did a year ago  The retailer is also offering enticing shipping deals from Nov  1 through Nov  21  which includes free shipping on thousands of items with no minimum purchase  And Target s partnership with Disney should help the retailer boost its toy sales during the holidays Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast a bottom line hike of 8 26  to  1 18 per share and a top line gain of 3 63  to  18 47 billion  Comparable store sales in the third quarter are projected to come in at 3 67  and the retailer is estimated to add nine more stores from its Q2 2019 figure  Looking ahead to fiscal 2019 s figures  our estimates anticipate earnings to climb 14 47  to  6 17 per share and for net sales to reach  78 33 billion for a 3 95  rally Takeaway Target has seen its earnings estimates revised higher  which helps TGT earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Target is also currently trading just below its all time high and it hopes that an impressive Q3 report can send it soaring to new levels  However  to reach new record levels  Target will need to show investors that its digital commerce channels can continue to grow Wall Street might also expect Target to provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter  This would help assure investors that the holiday season is set to be bountiful for Target Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3

24200,245715,AMED,Medtronic s MiniMed 670G Shows Favorable Outcome In Europe,opinion,Medtronic plc  s   NYSE MDT   Diabetes Management segment is dominating the headlines of late  Following the

the company announced favorable real world clinical outcomes of its MiniMed 670G insulin pump system with respect to European patients  Going by the press release  the real world data showed average

comprises a feature called SmartGuard Auto Mode  This automates and personalizes the delivery of basal insulin 24 hours a day  The system is the only commercially available technology that provides protection against highs and lows  It also steadily supports the Time in Range so that it reaches the target of 120 mg dL throughout the day In this regard  the clinical guidelines set for the Time in Range ascertain the target of effective diabetes management in the range of 70 180 mg dL for at least 70  of time  However  MiniMed 670G with its SmartGuard Auto Mode has crossed this target in a real

24524,246039,AMED,Play DuPont Technique To Land On 5 Top Ranked Stocks ,opinion,"Return on equity is one of the most sought after metrics by investors  The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 
To shortlist these gems  one can look at the DuPont  NYSE DD  technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of the nine stocks that made it through the screen

stock screen  A critical analysis of a company s financial background is essential for a better investment decision Often investors evaluate a company s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings  which sometimes do not reveal the real picture  To be more precise  they do not tell whether a company s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations  Here  the role of coverage ratios comes into play   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company  And the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  One should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1

24567,246082,AMED,Use Rising P E Strategy To Buy 5 Winning Stocks,opinion,"A common investing technique is to hunt for stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio  That s because this basic measure of how much investors are spending for  1 worth of earnings speaks of undervaluation  The logic is simple   a stock s current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside 
But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P E can also be worth buying  We ll tell you why 
Power of Increasing P E
The concept is that as earnings rise  so should the price of the stock  As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher  strong demand for the stock should continue to push up its prices  After all  astock s P E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings 
Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  Now if the P E ratio becomes 35 within a short spell of time  it means that the person is ready to pay  35 for only  1 worth of earnings  It shows that the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals 
So  if the P E of a stock is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal   
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 44 
Here are five out of the 44 stocks 
Amedisys Inc    NASDAQ AMED    The Zacks Rank  1 company is a leading provider of healthcare in the home with a vision of becoming the premiere solution for patients  It comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 31   
AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV    It is a global  research based biopharmaceutical company  It hails from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 24    The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 
Laureate Education Inc    NASDAQ LAUR    This Zacks Rank  1 company is a degree granting higher education institution  It belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 14    You can see

Key CatalystWe expect PerkinElmer s Diagnostics segment to be a major driver for second quarter 2019 results  The segment is likely to have witnessed higher revenues in the soon to be reported quarter  primarily driven by sustained growth across the company s reproductive health  immunodiagnostics and applied genomics business lines Rising demand for earlier diagnosis and increase in adoption of new technologies has been fueling growth across all three of segments of reproductive health  immunodiagnostics and genomics  We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter as well Further  the continued rise in infectious and autoimmune diseases  especially in emerging markets  is expected to drive growth in this segment Reflective of these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s second quarter revenues stands at  289 million  indicating an improvement of 5 9  year over year Other Factors at PlayPerkinElmer is likely to have witnessed solid international growth in the to be

24607,246122,AMED,5 Top Ranked Stocks Empowered By DuPont Analysis,opinion,"Return on equity is an investor favorite metric when it comes to cherry picking quality stocks  But ROE doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might get fooled by picking stocks based on this number   Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DD  technique seems to be an intriguing idea 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
The DuPont analysis allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to a ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis gets the upper hand while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of nine stocks that made it through the screen 
Ross Stores Inc    NASDAQ ROST    This Zacks Rank  2 company operates Ross Dress for Less  Ross   the largest off price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States  the District of Columbia and Guam  The stock comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 5    You can see  
Shoe Carnival  NYSE CCL  Inc    NASDAQ SCVL    The company is one of the nation s largest family footwear retailers  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2 and belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 40   
Stitch Fix Inc    NASDAQ SFIX    The company provides an online subscription and personal shopping platform  Its stock hails from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 40   and has a Zacks Rank  2 
Amedisys Inc    NASDAQ AMED    The company is a leading provider of healthcare in home with a vision of becoming the premiere solution for patients  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1 and comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 30   
NVR Inc    NYSE NVR    This company operates in two business segments  homebuilding and mortgage banking  The homebuilding unit sells and constructs homes under the Ryan Homes  NVHomes and Heartland Homes brands  It has a Zacks Rank  1 and belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 16

with Impressive Interest Coverage Ratios to Buy NowWe often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research

24667,246182,AMED,What s In Store For Boston Scientific s  BSX  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Boston Scientific Corporation   NYSE BSX   is scheduled to report second quarter 2019 results on Jul 24  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 78   However  it delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters  the average being 6 54  Let s see  how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Key CatalystsWe are upbeat about solid contributions from Boston Scientific s Cardiovascular business group  which comprises Interventional Cardiology  IC  and Peripheral Interventions  PI  Interventional CardiologyWe are optimistic about the IC business  which will help the company maintain impressive global growth  courtesy of an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams  Complex PCI  percutaneous coronary intervention  products within IC are growing strongly on the back of successful global expansion efforts Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
    Within IC  the company is demonstrating continued strength in structural heart with WATCHMAN  ACURATE  SENTINEL  and complex PCI and PCI guidance portfolios  The ACURATE TAVR valve platform has emerged as the fastest growing valve in Europe and registered nearly 30  growth in the last reported quarter  We expect these upsides to contribute to the company s top line in the upcoming quarterly results More specifically  the company is highly optimistic about the IC sub segment s performance in the second quarter  banking on its recent launches  In this regard  Boston Scientific received a CE Mark in March and initiated a market launch of the next generation WATCHMAN FLX Left Atrial Appendage Closure  LAAC  Device in Europe in the same month  It also received a Japanese approval of WATCHMAN during the quarter  The company expects to witness consistent growth in WATCHMAN in the upcoming quarters  riding on the rising adoption and expanding international footprint of the device Strong uptick by complex coronary products  the launch of Promus ELITE  the FDA approval of the Vici Viniti stent in May 2019 and the continued momentum of the structural heart portfolio are expected to drive growth for the IC sub segment in the to be reported quarter The company s initiation of a controlled commercial launch of LOTUS Edge in Europe in the first quarter is also expected to benefit its upcoming quarterly results The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IC revenues is pegged at  705 million  indicating an increase of 6 5  from the year ago quarter s reported figure Peripheral Interventions In recent quarters  the PI business steadily demonstrated a solid uptrend across segments like peripheral arterial disease  venous and interventional oncology  This was led by the Eluvia DS launch in the United States and double digit growth in interventional oncology  We anticipate this trend to continue in the to be reported quarter Per Boston Scientific  Eluvia has a substantial market potential  owing to the large addressable patient population  a differentiated  sustained release technology  and the superior clinical outcomes with reduced need for reintervention  We believe  this launch to be accretive to the company s second quarter results However  Boston Scientific expects slower adoption of Eluvia in the United States and Europe in the second quarter due to ongoing Paclitaxel concerns  Although  in June s FDA Advisory Committee panel meeting  the company presented updated clinical data affirming the safety of Paclitaxel and the Eluvia stent  any chance of immediate recovery from that situation is bleak The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter PI revenues stands at  319 million  suggesting a 4 9  rise from the prior year quarter s reported figure Other Factors at PlayAmong the other segments  MedSurg is expected to demonstrate a stable performance  led by endoscopy  in the to be reported quarter  Urology and Pelvic Health segment is also projected to surpass the market levels  driven by investment strategies in key international geographies Within endoscopy  the company is expected to deliver sturdy results  driven by a promising performance in its hemostasis franchise in infection prevention and strong pathology Urology and Pelvic Health business should also maintain momentum on the back of a robust global performance in the second quarter  Within neuromodulation  of late  the company is registering strong growth in the United States  led by robust performance of the WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stimulation and the Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation platforms  This trend is expected to continue in the to be reported quarter Boston Scientific s recent acquisitions added several products with immense growth potential to its portfolio  Within the pain management portfolio  the company s recent acquisition of Vertiflex Inc is expected to significantly contribute to the top line in the second quarter The company is gradually fortifying its presence in the emerging markets of Brazil  Russia  India and China  BRIC   It is currently targeting about 10 emerging markets to expand its footprint  The company is also pinning hopes on its core cardiology segment  which is gradually attaining stability with growth in the BRIC nations Which Way Are Estimates Treading The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of  2 64 billion suggests growth of 5 9  from the prior year quarter s reported figure  Also  the consensus mark for earnings of 38 cents indicates a 7 32  decline from the year ago quarter s reported

24681,246196,AMED,Is Trade War Scaring You  Buy 5 DuPont Tested Quality Stocks ,opinion,"As U S  China trade tensions have escalated this month and market volatility has edged higher  investors are probably hunting for some quality picks to stay unscathed by the trade war inflicted selloff  In this vein  betting on stocks that are rich in return on equity  ROE  can be rewarding 
ROE is one of the most coveted metrics among investors in search of profit generating stocks  But ROE doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might make a mistake by selecting stocks based on this ratio   Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique seem a prudent decision 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income Equity
Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Inside the Strength of DuPont
The DuPont analysis allows investors to evaluate the elements that are the driving factors in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor relying solely on basic ROE may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at the financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 10 stocks that made it through the screen 
Shoe Carnival  NYSE CCL   Inc     NASDAQ SCVL     This Zacks Rank  2 company is one of the nation s largest family footwear retailers  The stock belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 34    You can see  
Ulta Beauty Inc     NASDAQ ULTA     The company is a beauty retailer and salon service provider primarily in the United States  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  It comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 26

NVR  Inc     NYSE NVR    The company operates in two business segments  homebuilding and mortgage banking  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1 and belongs to a top ranked Zacks sector  top 20

24969,246484,AMED,Worried About Rate Hikes  Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks,opinion,In the complex world of investment  debt financing is a well known strategy adopted by the majority of corporations for expanding their business operations from time to time  Dearth of ample funds is the primary driving force behind this strategy  However  resorting to debt is still considered a taboo as it carries the burden of interest payments This is because companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario  Of course  companies may resort to equity financing as an alternative option to boost their financial resources  However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well So  debt financing remains the favored option for corporates in times of funding their operations  In particular  it is the easy and cheap availability of debt that makes it more popular among corporations However  too much debt is detrimental for a company s health  If a company is highly leveraged  in other words carries exorbitant amount of debt  investors will not add it to their portfolios willingly  Afterall  a high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which may affect the company s bottom line With the current U S  administration being in favor of a steady interest rate hike over the near term  investors might be reluctant to pick any U S  stock for the time being  However  a mere rate hike should not discourage investors since the U S  economy has been debt dependent since its foundation and is still the largest in the world  What they need to do is pick companies that have a lower debt burden This is where the significance of financial leverage ratio comes into play as it measures the extent of financial leverage a company bears  To choose a corporation that is not so highly indebted  several leverage ratios have been developed over the years  with debt to equity ratio being the most popular Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company With the Q4 earnings season coming to an end  investors must be targeting companies with solid earnings growth projections  But  in the uncertain world of investment  markets can falter anytime  particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage  Therefore  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level is not a wise move The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure safe returns However  an investment strategy based solely on debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are

24997,246512,AMED,These 5 Low Leverage Stocks Are Safe Bets,opinion,Leverage refers to an investment strategy that involves borrowing of funds to expand business  purchase inventory and other assets as well as support other aspects of business operations  Financial leverage is the amount of debt that exists in the capital structure of a company Per the theory of cost of capital  a company s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity used to finance capital projects  A comparative analysis of the same theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper  especially in periods of low interest rates This is because when a company resorts to debt financing  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s profits as well  So  debt financing valued by corporates Yet  debt financing is not always a welcome way  This is because companies with heavy debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt if things go downhill So  if a company is highly leveraged  in other words carries an exorbitant amount of debt  investors will not be willing to add the stock  A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which affects the bottom line Nevertheless  this should not shift investor attention from U S  stocks since debt has been part of the economy since foundation and yet the country boasts the largest stock market in the world  What investors need to do is choose stocks with caution  avoiding those with high debt loads This is where the significance of financial leverage ratio comes into play as it measures the extent of financial leverage a company bears  To choose a corporation that is not so heavily indebted  several leverage ratios have been developed over the years  with the debt

case one of your goals for the year is to improve your financial health  But before we delve into the details  let us first understand how the economy fared last year and what is expected out of 2019 and thereafter Glimpse of the U S  EconomyThe political and economic scenario in the United States was highly volatile in 2018  So what went wrong last year Let us begin with the  1 9 trillion tax cut of December 2017  which resulted in a jump in investments in the first half of 2018  However  major incidents and growing speculation of an economic slowdown made the investment boom vanish by the third quarter The U S  China trade war  the massive data breaches  and cyber warfare threats rocked various industries  particularly technology  resulting in a flurry of institutional sell offs  Consequently  the gains recorded by the S P 500 and Nasdaq stocks in the first half of the year were wiped off However  a strong labor market outlook and an expected GDP of 2 5  for 2019 means that it is likely to be a Goldilocks economy this year  which is healthy Another good outcome of the government s policies is that after many years of steep raises by insurance companies  premiums are anticipated to fall slightly in 2019 The Federal Reserve increased interest rates three times in 2018  However  in the announcement on Jan 30  the Fed temporarily suspended its plans to continue interest hikes for 2019  The rates  which range from 2 25 2 50  currently  are likely to remain the same for some time Despite the halt in the rising trend of interest rates  banks and insurers are expected to continue to benefit Tip 1  Invest In InsuranceIf we shift our attention from interest rates to an improving labor market  we can safely conclude that it will be able to boost policy sales even at higher premiums  The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 3 5  in 2019  which should perk up demand for life insurance and annuity products The expected fall in premiums makes this investment idea even more attractive Furthermore  apart from getting insurance  you can also consider investing in a couple of insurance stocks that are positioned well to reap profits through underlying potency and business modification  riding on rising interest rates  brisk annuity business  solid labor market  and adoption of advanced technology  Investing in stocks with promising long term earnings growth rates  like First American Corporation   NYSE FAF   and Manulife Financial Corporation   NYSE MFC    are likely to give you good returns on investment Tip 2  Invest in Rainy Day   Retirement FundsHard times can come without any warning  Speculation about an upcoming recession in an economy that is still reeling from a rocky ride last year adds fuel to the fact that setting up emergency funds and  should now be at the top of the priority list An easy way to figure out how much money you need to set aside for financial emergencies is to calculate your monthly expenses including medical  grocery  rental and other miscellaneous bills  Multiply this figure by the number of months you expect to find new employment in case of a job loss  The result you get will give you the amount you need to invest in an emergency fund  Let us understand this figuratively Let us assume you need  2 000 to cover all your expenses for a month  Now  considering you have the skills necessary to find employment in six months  your total amount in an emergency fund should be six times  2 000  or   12 000  This should provide a decent buffer for you in the time between an event of job loss and re employment There are a few online emergency fund calculators that you can refer to for guidance Tip 3  Diversified InvestmentsAfter securing yourself for any medical or financial emergency  now it is time to improve your financial health  There are numerous ways to achieve this but here we have picked two options  investing in ETFs and Peer to Peer Lending You ll likely have been warned not to put all your eggs in one basket  Both the aforementioned investment options go by this rule  Let us first talk about the more common one   ETFs ETFs  or exchange traded funds  have gained significant traction over the last several years  They are structured in a way that your invested money is spread across well performing stocks  focused on a specific sector  which is poised for future growth Investors could consider the SPDR S P Dividend ETF   TO SDY   and the SPDR MSCI USA Strategic Factors ETF   which focus on quality more than quantity  You can also choose among several other preferred   which are well positioned to grow Now  coming to the less conventional method  Peer to Peer Lending can lead you to reap significant profits by offering your money as a loan to individuals and earning interest  There are various platforms like Lending Club and Prosper through which you can lend your money  The risk is minimized because your invested money is broken into small amounts and lent out to various individuals  However  it is advised to opt for this investment only if you have money to spare Free Tip  Invest in Elderly Healthcare IndustryThe resolution to

25081,246596,AMED,Zacks com Featured Expert Kevin Matras Highlights  Helmerich   Payne  Manulife Financial  HEICO  Amedisys And Titan Machinery,opinion,"For Immediate Release 
  
  Chicago  IL   January 8  2019   Stocks in this week s article include  Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP    Manulife Financial Corp    NYSE MFC    HEICO Corp    NYSE HEI    Amedisys  Inc    NASDAQ AMED   and Titan Machinery Inc    NASDAQ TITN    Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their  first  profit and explains why they are ones to watch Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks to Stay Away from Debt Traps 
 Wall Street ended the first week of 2019 on an encouraging note  bouncing back from its turbulent start to the year  after stellar economic data point eased fears of a looming recession  In particular  the Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell recently announced that the overall global economy looks promising amid choppy market  while on the other hand  the Labor Department has released increased U S  non farm payrolls data   the biggest jump since February  
 Both these news have infused enough confidence among investors about the U S  stock market s growth potential  as reflected in the suspension of the sell off that Wall Street witnessed at the very onset of 2019  Notably  these developments are now anticipated to boost the stock market  
 Nevertheless  one should remember that nothing is eternal and uncertainty can hit the global equity market anytime  without any prior notice  And if it does  an investor would want to take the right precautions for such periods of crisis  
 To this end  it is imperative to mention that since debt ridden companies are more vulnerable at times of volatility  it is better to avoid those for achieving optimal returns  
 Of course  entirely avoiding companies with debt loads is virtually impossible as debt financing is an inherent feature of corporate financing  Still eliminating the ones bearing exorbitant debt loads might be a wise idea  since the more the company is leveraged  the more it is prone to get hit at times of a financial crunch  
 And here comes the importance of leverage ratios  which are used by analysts to ensure that no investor chooses corporations with a high debt burden  Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  to evaluate a company s creditworthiness for potential equity investments  
 Analyzing Debt Equity 
 Debt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company  
 In general  investors target companies with solid earnings growth projections  But  in the uncertain world of investment  markets can trip anytime  particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage  Therefore  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level is not a wise move

25082,246597,AMED,5 Quality Stock Picks Based On DuPont Analysis,opinion,"Return on equity  ROE  can be considered one of the most reliable metrics when investors set out to select quality stocks  That said  we would like to note that the basic ROE calculation doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might get misled by picking stocks based on this number  
Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique seems to be an intriguing idea 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Inside the Strength of DuPont
The DuPont analysis allows investors to evaluate the elements that are the driving factors in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor relying solely on basic ROE may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at the financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 10 stocks that made it through the screen

25122,246637,AMED,Bet On DuPont Analysis  Play 5 Quality Stocks,opinion,"Return on equity  ROE  is one of the most coveted metrics among investors in search of profit generating stocks  Delving into the basic ROE  with the help of DuPont  NYSE DWDP  analysis  before shortlisting stocks could lead to even better returns  It s basically taking ROE apart to examine how it works  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income Equity
Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Inside the Strength of DuPont
The DuPont analysis allows investors to evaluate the elements that are the driving factors in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor relying solely on basic ROE may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at the financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of eight stocks that made it through the screen 
Caseys General Stores Inc    NASDAQ CASY    This Zacks Rank  1 company and its wholly owned subsidiaries operate convenience stores under the names Casey s and Casey s General Store  The stock belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 1    You can see

25134,246649,AMED,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks To Stay Away From Debt Traps ,opinion,Wall Street ended the first week of 2019 on an encouraging note  bouncing back from its turbulent start to the year  after stellar economic data point eased fears of a looming recession  In particular  the Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell recently announced that the overall global economy looks promising amid choppy market  while on the other hand  the Labor Department has released increased U S  non farm payrolls data   the biggest jump since February Both these news have infused enough confidence among investors about the U S  stock market s growth potential  as reflected in the suspension of the sell off that Wall Street witnessed at the very onset of 2019  Notably  these developments are now anticipated to boost the stock market Nevertheless  one should remember that nothing is eternal and uncertainty can hit the global equity market anytime  without any prior notice  And if it does  an investor would want to take the right precautions for such periods of crisis To this end  it is imperative to mention that since debt ridden companies are more vulnerable at times of volatility  it is better to avoid those for achieving optimal returns Of course  entirely avoiding companies with debt loads is virtually impossible as debt financing is an inherent feature of corporate financing  Still eliminating the ones bearing exorbitant debt loads might be a wise idea  since the more the company is leveraged  the more it is prone to get hit at times of a financial crunch And here comes the importance of leverage ratios  which are used by analysts to ensure that no investor chooses corporations with a high debt burden  Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  to evaluate a company s creditworthiness for potential equity investments Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company In general  investors target companies with solid earnings growth projections  But  in the uncertain world of investment  markets can trip anytime  particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage  Therefore  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level is not a wise move The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure safe returns However  an investment strategy based solely on debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectationZacks Rank  1 or 2  Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 23 stocks that made it through the screen Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP    It is a contract drilling company engaged primarily in the drilling of oil and gas wells for exploration and production companies  The company generated a positive earnings surprise of 5 56  in the last reported quarter and currently carries a Zacks Rank  2 Manulife Financial Corp    NYSE MFC    It is one of the three dominant life insurers within the domestic Canadian market  The company currently

Dredge   Dock Corp    NASDAQ GLDD   5 Stocks with Recent Price Strength to Enhance Your Returns In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds a good idea  Here is how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create the magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners For

25139,246654,AMED,4 Medical Device Stocks That More Than Doubled In 2018,opinion,Medical device stocks did well in 2018  courtesy of favorable exposure to Artificial Intelligence  AI  based applications along with medical mechatronics and big data applications  encouraging demographics and increased business investments Broadly speaking  the U S  economy has benefited from rise in consumer spending  improvement in labor market  higher customer confidence and increase in wages  Additionally  three interest rate hikes by the Fed  indicating inherent economic stability  have boosted investors  confidence The Medical   Products Industry within the broader Medical Sector has outperformed the Zacks S P 500 Composite year to date  While stocks in the industry have collectively declined 1 8   the Zacks S P 500 Composite fell 2 7  What s Benefiting Medical Device Stocks Going by a CISION report  the United States is the largest Medical Products market in the world  raking in more than  180 billion in revenues a year  Thus  it has been a very profitable investment space of late The sector benefits from favorable consumer behavior  growing prevalence of minimally invasive surgeries  demand for liquid biopsy tests  use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value based model The latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  which among many other changes  slashed corporate tax rates to 21  from the earlier 35   has provided impetus to the market This apart  the U S  medical device companies are currently riding high on R D innovation  courtesy of the 2 3  Medical Device tax abolition earlier this year  According to an article published in Xtalks  the Medical Device tax was responsible for a  34 million reduction in R D spending by companies  The bill also delays the Cadillac tax  a 40  tax on employer insurance  until 2022 AI Opening Up New Avenues The U S  Medical Products industry has turned 2018 into  the year of inventions  With a series of developments like the human brain pacemaker  electronic skin that displays vital signs of the body  needle free injections and many more  the medical fraternity has been hogging the limelight through the year Furthermore  this sector is seeing increased use of cloud based applications and AI  Companies like Veeva Systems   NYSE VEEV   and athenahealth s   NASDAQ ATHN   focus on cloud based services deserve a special mention here Per research by LEGACY MEDSearch  the global medical device technology market is expected to see a CAGR of 4 6  to reach a value of  563 886 5 million by 2025 Can We Expect the Momentum to Stay Despite an eventful year  the medical device space is confronted by short term hurdles associated with the U S  China trade war  According to a survey conducted by the Medical Imaging   Technology Alliance  MITA   the tariffs will cost medical products companies nearly  138 million every year Thus  companies will be compelled to reduce workforce and investments in R D to meet this  new and unnecessary expense   This also increases the chances of costs being passed on to end users  making healthcare more expensive There have also been regulatory hurdles  For instance  the Unique Device Identification  UDI  system by the FDA has been quite costly and difficult to implement for medical product manufacturers Adding to the woes  the medical device tax repeal amendment is a temporary relief for manufacturers  The tax will be back in effect on Jan 1  2020 The latest inversion of the  Treasury Yield Curve  is another factor to fret about  as analysts apprehend an economic recession in 2019  Not to forget  the yield curve last inverted in 2008  just before the Great Recession  Also  fresh data from IMF shows that the economy will maintain its slow pace in 2019 and 2020 4 Significant Gainers of 2018As the curtains roll down on 2018  let us do a quick recap of the four well performing

25140,246655,AMED,Ride On DuPont Analysis With 5 Top Stocks ,opinion,"In a market where complacency levels may falter any time thanks to central banks  moves  geo political concerns and macroeconomic issues  picking the right stock is a challenge  The return on equity metric goes a long way in resolving this issue 
The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 
But to fine tune this basic concept  one can land on DuPont  NYSE DWDP  analysis  This theory will take investors a step higher and better pick some quality stocks  
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of the 18 stocks that made it through the screen 
Amedisys Inc    NASDAQ AMED    This Zacks Rank  1 company is a provider of healthcare in the home  It belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 39   You can see

25141,246656,AMED,Ring In 2019 With These 7 Solid Growth Stocks In Your Kitty,opinion,Stocks have been on a topsy turvy ride in 2018  thanks to the U S  China trade war  uncertainty over Brexit  budget concern in Italy  a stronger dollar that hurt emerging markets  tech weakness and volatile oil prices due to ongoing geopolitical tensions  Moreover  the U S  Federal Reserve s hawkish stance

headwinds will continue to drag down stock performance in 2019 as well  Notably  several companies have lowered their 2019 outlook factoring in the impact of the tariffs imposed as a result of the trade war The increase in tariff from 10  to 25   on hold till Mar 1  2019  on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports  if imposed  will have a significant impact on companies  profits  Besides  with the tariff being passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices  it will also take a toll on their spending Moreover  the impact of the tax cut has already started to fade and the back to back rate hikes by Fed have also not gone down well with investors  The Fed recently hiked interest rates for the fourth time this year and projected two hikes for 2019   However  it did strike a dovish

25181,246696,AMED,5 Stocks With Recent Price Strength To Enhance Your Return,opinion, In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds a good idea  Here is how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create the magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners Screening Parameters Percentage Change in Price  4 Weeks  greater than zero  This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage Change Price  12 Weeks  greater than 10  This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Average Broker Rating 1 or 2  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock s future performance Current Price greater than 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 Current Price  52 Week High Low Range more than 85   This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52 week highs  It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just seven Here are five out of the seven stocks Spirit Airlines Inc    NYSE SAVE   is a leading provider of low fare airline services in the

25182,246697,AMED,4 Quality Stocks To Counter Market Volatility,opinion,"Rising oil prices  a more hawkish Fed  a strengthening dollar coupled with technology companies hitting new lows had a negative impact on the broader markets 
With the markets currently facing a lot of gyration  investing in quality stocks seems prudent  After all  these stocks provide excellent risk adjusted returns 
U S  Market Indexes Point Downward
Financial markets have witnessed a downward trend in the past one and a half months due to Nasdaq Composite s 10 4  drop since Oct 1  The broader S P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 6 7  and 4 7   respectively in the same timeframe  reflecting certain political and economic factors that impacted the markets negatively 
While the markets have recovered slightly since then  with Nasdaq Composite  S P 500 and Dow Jones losing 3 1   0 51  and 0 02  respectively since Nov 1  the broader picture looks far from optimistic  The fundamental backdrop appears blurred with Fed s indication of a rate hike in December  United States  ongoing trade war with China and global political and economic affairs 
Market volatility induced by these factors could be the reason behind investors  defensive stance of investing in quality stocks 
What is Pushing Financial Markets Down 
Oil prices recovered on Nov 12  largely aided by Saudi Arabia s energy minister Khalid al Falih s announcement that Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  and its allies could cut production by 1 million barrels per day  bpd  from October levels to stabilize the recent fall in oil prices 
This oil price recovery thus could hamper consumer spending and in turn affect industries such as retail and consumer discretionary 
America s strong economic outlook coupled with political and economic conflicts in Europe led to an increase in demand for dollar  thus increasing its value  While a stronger dollar may appear attractive  it does not have a positive impact on American businesses shipping their products overseas  A higher dollar increases the value of American products abroad  raising the possibility of consumers turning to cheaper  domestic brands  thus affecting American business revenues 
Although the Fed refrained from increasing federal funds rates in November  there are ample reasons to expect a rate hike in December  followed by three more hikes next year  America s healthy job market  under control inflation  sustainable gross domestic product and surge in consumer spending paint a pretty picture for the economy  raising the probability of interest rate hikes further  While financial institutions are expected to benefit from Fed s rising rates  it s not welcoming news for businesses and consumers alike 
In addition  the recent drop in financial markets was due to fall in technology stocks primarily dragged down by Apple  NASDAQ AAPL    Apple s shares declined 5  after Lumentum   one of Apple s suppliers  cut its fiscal outlook for the current quarter  following the request of one of its largest customers to slash shipments  Although Lumentum did not mention Apple  it did not take investors long to figure out as the latter generates one third of Lumentum s revenues

25183,246698,AMED,5 Low Leverage Stocks You Can Safely Add To Your Portfolio,opinion,In corporate finance  leverageis the use of exogenous funds by corporations to run their operations smoothly and expand the same  While there is option for equity financing  historically debt financing has been preferred over equity This is because debt is available easily and is cheaper compared with equity financing  However  one should keep in mind that debt financing remains a feasible option as long as the companies succeed in generating a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate  Exorbitant debt financing might even lead to a corporation s bankruptcy in a worst case scenario Especially  in times of crisis  no one can be fully sure of how a company will perform the next day  On top of that  the ones bearing large amount of debt are even more prone to bankruptcy  Therefore  the debt level of a company is an important point of consideration while making an investment decision Considering the fact that uncertainty can hit the share market anytime  it is better to take measures beforehand than repent later  This is why investors needs to look for stocks that are relatively less leveraged  since a corporation with zero debt hardly exists And here comes the importance of leverage ratios  which have been constructed to safeguard investors from becoming victims of debt trap  Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  to evaluate a company s creditworthiness for potential equity investments Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company Although companies reflecting high earnings growth should be ideal investment choices  those with high leverage may not generate satisfactory returns  Since a greater cohort of investors is risk averse by nature  it is reasonable to expect that they will be more attracted to companies with low leverage than high earnings growth The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure safe returns However  an investment strategy based solely on debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectationZacks Rank  1 or 2  Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy

25184,246699,AMED,5 Stocks To Gain As Fed Chair  Blinks  On Rates ,opinion,On Nov 29  Fed Chair Jerome Powell s comments helped the Dow post its largest one day gains in eight months  Powell unequivocally stated that rates were close to neutral  a clear departure from comments made two months ago  On that occasion  his statements had sent the S P 500 into correction mode But now Jerome Powell has indicated that the Fed may be at the end of its three year tightening cycle  This is in keeping with market expectations and addresses President Trump s repeated criticism of the Fed Chair s stance on rates With trade tensions also likely to be addressed over the weekend  markets are likely to shrug the volatility which has gripped stocks in recent times  Investors would now best prepare for sunnier days ahead  which make it imperative to pick select growth stocks Powell  Blinks  on RatesSpeaking at The Economic Club of New York  Powell said that interest rates are still at historical lows  At the same time  they are currently only a shade below  the level that would be neutral for the economy   His closely watched speech was a clear departure from comments made around two months ago Powell s speech was in consonance with comments made by Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida on Nov 27  Underlining the importance of a data dependent approach to monetary policy  Clarida said interest rates were  much closer  to a neutral level On that occasion  the Fed Chair had said that rates were a  long way from neutral   Following his remarks  the S P 500 entered correction mode  Subsequently  his stance on rates has come in for sharp criticism from President Trump  On Nov 27  Trump said that he was  not even a little bit happy  with his choice of Powell as Fed Chair Commenting on Powell s change in stance  CNBC s Jim Cramer tweeted that the Fed Chair had  blinked  on rates   Powell sees the global slowdown and knows that it could hurt us   tweeted Cramer  attributing the change in stance to this factor Trade Tensions Likely to be Addressed  GDP RobustMeanwhile  The New York Times has reported that President Trump is concerned about the impact of lingering trade tensions with China on equity markets and the economy  This could lead to the President seeking a compromise on trade on the sidelines of the G 20 summit starting in Argentina this weekend This is clear divergence from Trump s recent stance on trade relations with China  In fact  they are more in keeping with recent comments from U S  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow  On Nov 27  Kudlow said the U S  government has reopened negotiations on trade issues with China at several high powered levels Additionally  the economy remains robust as can be gleaned from the latest GDP numbers  The Department of Commerce s second estimate kept third quarter GDP unrevised at a 3 5  pace  A spike in inventories and business investment has been the primary catalyst to the strong pace of growth witnessed during the quarter     Our ChoicesPowell s change in stance comes as a welcome surprise for markets which have been weighed down by fears about a tougher rate

25234,246749,AMED,Bet On DuPont Analysis With 5 Top Ranked Stocks,opinion,"Return on equity is one of the most coveted metrics by investors  The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 
To shortlist these gems  one can look at the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of the 15 stocks that made it through the screen

those with a terminal illness  or hospice care at the end of life Impressive Q3 EarningsDuring the third quarter  EPS of 95 cents crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents and grew almost 70  year over year Revenues of  417 million also beat our consensus estimate and jumped 11 7  from the prior year quarter Amedisys s Home Health division generated revenues of  294 million  while Medicare revenues increased 8 7   Its Hospice division saw revenues of  103 4 million  up 7 8  year over year Gross margin expanded 100 basis points  bps  to 40 2  in Q3  In the company s earnings release  CEO

to grow almost 13   the consensus estimate sits at  4 04 cents per share  with eight upward revisions in the last two months Bottom LineAMED s strong performance in 2018  plus encouraging growth in its Home Health and Hospice divisions  puts the company in a good spot heading into the new year  Plus  its recent acquisition of hospice care provider Compassionate Care Hospice will give Amedisys even more market share in the industry  making it the third largest hospice provider in America For those investors looking for a healthcare stock to add to their portfolio  AMED should definitely be

rates across the company s various markets Earnings of 72 cents per share matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate  but is down 1  from the price year quarter Revenues fell 3  to  3 85 billion  missing our consensus estimate  Volume sales were flat during the period  and organic sales slipped 0 5   Top line growth was also affected by trade inventory reductions in China and volatility in Brazil

results  saying  The third quarter was a challenging one with category growth rates remaining soft in many markets and unfavorable movements in foreign exchange  It didn t take long for analysts to lower their estimates for fiscal 2018  and nine have slashed their earnings outlook in the last 60 days  our consensus has fallen 6 cents from  3 02 to  2 96  But  earnings could grow around 3  for this time period The consensus estimate has fallen for next fiscal year  too  down 17 cents from  3 22 to  3 05 per share  Nine analysts have also cut their estimates for this time period as well CL is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Looking ahead  Cook said he does still see some of the same challenges for Q4  but noted uncertainty in the global markets  Colgate Palmolive anticipates a low single digit organic sales increase  but lowered adjusted earnings guidance just a bit from mid single digit growth to 3  4  If you re an investor looking for a similar consumer staples stock pick to add to

The agreement came after almost two years of discussion on the so called  banking package  that was proposed by the European Commission in November 2016 The agreed upon measures are expected to ensure financial stability by addressing issues that previously was ignored  Also  banks  lending capacity is likely to improve and thus better support the EU economy Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis expressed his delight at the parliament and council reaching an agreement on the banking package  after months of  very complex and technical discussions   He further added   This very important risk reducing package complements the progress that has already been achieved over the past years  and lays the basis for further progress on strengthening the Banking Union  While some matters are yet to be decided upon  the Commission expects to finalize the political agreement by the end of the year Key Highlights of the MeetingRiskier European banks will be subject to higher capital requirements and they will require to adopt methodologies that are able to reflect more accurately the actual risks to which the institutions are exposed Pre determined leverage ratio would be implemented on the banks to keep them from excessive leverage along with a fixed net stable funding ratio to control the dependence on short term wholesale funding and to reduce long term funding risk

requirement   Total Loss Absorbing Capacity   is expected to increase the resilience of institutions and enhance financial stability Further  measures that target to bolster lending capacity of banks

laundering cases involving EU banks is to be conducted to acknowledge the factor that enabled or led to them  Also  the key areas that need closer scrutiny by prudential supervisors in relation to money laundering or terrorist financing risks are to be identified The action plan has a key objective of improving supervision and exchange of information between the relevant authorities  This will be done by monitoring implementation of the ESAs  risk based supervision joint guidelines and expand them to include guidance on best practices for the imposition of administrative sanctions in cases

growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive

25268,246783,AMED,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks Amid Rising Trade Tensions,opinion,U S  stocks tumbled at the beginning of this week as the trade dispute between America and China flared up  with both nations determined to impose import tariffs  Such heightened trade tensions between the world s two biggest economies initially spooked investors and sparked a sell off in the share market However  by the end of yesterday s trading session  major market indexes recovered to some extent and ended well off their lows  In particular  a rise in oil price drove energy shares and thereby stopped the stock market from a bigger fall Nevertheless  investors should take a lesson from this and maintain a relatively less risky portfolio so that at times of uncertainty  one can safeguard his her portfolio from huge loss   Herein comes the need for investors to remain well versed about leverage    In the complex world of corporate finance  a company needs exogenous funds for smooth operations  meeting obligations and expanding business  The two financial resources often resorted to are debt and equity A comparative analysis of the cost of capital theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity as debt is available at a lower cost compared to equity  especially in periods of low interest rates However  debt financing has its own drawbacks  The problem arises when leverage  referred to as the amount of debt a company bears  becomes exorbitant  In particular  companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario Therefore  for a safe investment strategy  understanding the amount of financial leverage that a company bears is crucial  This is because financial leverage multiplies the underlying business risk Of course  entirely avoiding companies with debt load is virtually impossible as debt financing is an inherent feature of corporate financing  Still eliminating those bearing exorbitant debt loads might be a wise idea  since the more the company is leveraged the more it is prone to get hit at times of a financial crunch Therefore  to safeguard their portfolio from losses  the real challenge for an investor is to determine whether the organization s debt level is sustainable  Historically  several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and debt to equity ratio is one of the most common ratios Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company According to estimates compiled by FactSet  analysts are predicting earnings growth of 18 9  in the second quarter of 2018 and a continuation of double digit growth for the rest of the year  Considering such projections  investors will most likely go for stocks that are exhibiting solid earnings growth  But if the stocks bear a high debt to equity ratio  in times of economic downturns  their so called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare Considering this  it will be wise for investors to select companies with low leverage  These are financially more secure and immune to financial bankruptcy The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure safe returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1 or 2  Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 27 stocks that made it through the screen HollyFrontier Corporation   NYSE HFC    The company produces and markets gasoline  diesel  jet fuel  asphalt  heavy products and specialty lubricant products  It pulled off an average

of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Low Leverage Stocks to Secure Your Portfolio Amid VolatilityInvestors should know that uncertainty can hit the global equity market anytime and therefore it is better to take measures beforehand than repent later  This is why investors need to be acquainted with leverage Notably  leverage  otherwise termed as debt financing  is the use of exogenous funds by corporations to run their operations smoothly and expand the same  Although there is option for equity financing  historically  debt financing has been preferred over equity because of its easy and cheap availability However  one should keep in mind that debt financing remains a feasible option as long as the companies succeed in generating a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate  Exorbitant debt financing might even lead to a corporation s bankruptcy in a worst case scenario  Therefore  one can safely invest in a stock as long as it bears a low level of debt And here comes the importance of leverage ratios  which have been constructed to safeguard investors from becoming victims of debt trap  Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  to evaluate a company s creditworthiness for potential equity investments Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company As the third quarter reporting season is in full swing  investors must be eyeing stocks that exhibited solid earnings growth in the prior quarters  But if a stock bears a high debt to equity ratio  in times of economic downturns  its so called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare Thus  it will be wise for investors to select companies with low leverage  These are financially more secure and immune to financial bankruptcy And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test  It can all be

25274,246789,AMED,Winning November To Make Up For A Spooky October  5 Picks,opinion,October has been a rocky month for equity investors  Fears of a longer trade spat between the United States and China along with rising interest rates are anticipated to show on corporate earnings But  economic growth is on track for a mind boggling year that could come teasingly close to a 13 year milestone  This should certainly lift corporate earnings  leading to an uptick in share prices this November  Lest we forget  the stock market has  historically  witnessed the best stretch of growth from this month till spring Given the positives  investing in solid stocks that can make the most of a heartening November seems prudent October Marks Worst Month for Stocks in 7 YearsAfter hitting milestones in September  the stock market came to a sudden halt in October  The broader S P 500 shed 6 9  and saw its steepest monthly decline since September 2011  The S P 500  in fact  narrowly escaped ending up in the correction territory on Oct 29  The index is now down 7 5  from its all time high reached on Sep 20 The Dow Jones also recorded its biggest monthly drop since January 2016  while the Nasdaq Composite saw its worst monthly fall since November 2008  The tech heavy index entered the correction territory for a brief period last month before recouping some of the losses this week So  what had spooked the markets last month  The United States and China have been imposing tariffs on each other s products  driving costs for companies and eventually dampening profits  On top of that  a rapidly rise in benchmark bond yield fueled fears that the profit margins of U S  corporates will get hurt by steeper borrowing costs Needless to say  the quarterly results of bigwigs like Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    AT T Inc    NYSE T   and Alphabet Inc    NASDAQ GOOGL   fell short of expectations  And some executives have cautioned that rising costs of essential commodities could further weigh on earnings in the near term Stocks Likely to Bounce Back in NovemberLet s  however  admit that concerns related to corporate earnings were overblown  After all  total Q3 earnings are estimated to improve 23 2  from the same period last year on 7 6  higher revenues  Thus  earnings growth is expected in the double digit territory for the sixth time in the last seven quarters  In fact  earnings for the 313 S P 500 members that have reported results are up 22 7  from the same period last year on 8 4  higher revenues  with 78  beating earnings estimates and 62 6  surpassing the revenue mark  read more   Earnings are largely improving on healthy economic growth and this should help the stock market get back on track  In the last two quarters  the U S  economy recorded the fastest six month growth in four years and is on track to hit the Trump administration s annual growth target of 3   If that happens  it would be the best yearly performance since 2005  two years before the Great Recession The U S  economy got a boost in the third quarter  with GDP increasing at an annualized pace of 3 5   per the U S  Commerce Department  In fact  the country s total output of goods and services followed an even stronger 4 2  growth in the second quarter  Midterm Elections Spells Good Times for StocksMidterm elections  by the way  are expected to provide some additional steam to the market  The stock market s gain in the six months following a midterm election in the third year of a given term of a presidency  which is currently scheduled for Nov 6  has been quite impressive  During this period  the S P 500 and the Dow Jones have gained an average 15 3  and 12   respectively The stock market also  historically  gains in the November through May period  or the so called  winter  months  while markets have been more or less flat during the  summer  months  May October   For instance  the Dow Jones has registered an average gain of 7 5  during the November April period

25275,246790,AMED,5 Top Ranked Stocks Driven By DuPont Analysis,opinion,"Return on equity is an investor favorite metric when it comes to cherry picking quality stocks  But ROE doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might get fooled by picking stocks based on this number   Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique seems to be an intriguing idea 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
The DuPont analysis allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis gets the upper hand while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 15 stocks that made it through the screen 
Marine Products Corporation    NYSE MPX     This Zacks Rank  1 company is the third largest distributor of sterndrive powerboats in the United States  The stock belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 9    You can see  
Sprouts Farmers Market Inc     NASDAQ SFM     The company is engaged in the retailing of natural and organic food primarily in the United States  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  The stock belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 28   
Amedisys Inc     NASDAQ AMED     The company is a leading provider of healthcare in home  It hails from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 39   and sports a Zacks Rank  1 
Duluth Holdings Inc     NASDAQ DLTH     The company provides casual wear  workwear and accessories for men and women  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  It belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 14   
Foot Locker Inc     NYSE FL     This is a leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparel  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 34

25281,246796,AMED,US Stocks Enjoy Highest Post Midterm Gains Since 1982  5 Picks ,opinion,On Nov 7  Wall Street posted its biggest gains after a midterm election since 1982  As was widely expected  Republicans held on to their Senate majority  even extending it by a slim margin  Meanwhile  Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives for the first time in a decade A large swathe of market watchers thinks that a gridlocked Congress will be beneficial for U S  equity markets  One section thinks that this will maintain the status quo  leaving the key Trump administration policy initiatives such as tax cuts and deregulation untouched Meanwhile  progress could be made on issues such as higher infrastructure spending  And any further policy moves would be fiscally neutral  meeting the approval of markets  This is why it makes sense to bet on stocks that have surged strongly year to date and are poised to consolidate on these gains in the near future Dow  S P 500 Post Best Gains in 36 YearsOn Wednesday  the Dow and S P 500 both gained 2 1   Even the embattled Nasdaq increased 2 6  with all three benchmarks closing short of intraday highs  This was the Dow and Nasdaq s largest single day increase since Oct 16 while the S P 500 posted its best session since Oct 25 More importantly  this post midterm rally exceeded the average gain which follows such results  According to Goldman Sachs   NYSE GS    the S P 500 posts an average gain of 0 7  from a day before such contests till a day after These were the largest such gains for the S P 500 and the Dow since the trading session after the 1982 midterm elections  On that occasion  the blue chip index and the S P 500 had increased by 4 3  and 3 9   respectively Gridlocked Congress to Benefit Wall Street Traditionally  stocks incur strong gains when a divided Congress is accompanied by a Republican President  According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC   the S P 500 posts an average annual return of 12  on such occasions  These gains stem from the belief that a gridlocked Congress will help to maintain the status quo Since Republicans continued to hold on to their Senate majority  Trump s tax cuts would survive until the Presidential elections of 2020  At the same time  a divided Congress could prevent the President from announcing further tax cuts which have already created a substantial budget deficit Congress could even witness bipartisan progress on higher infrastructure spending  This is one issue Trump has been touting since his election and dovetails neatly into traditional Democratic priorities  Any measure taken on this count would also be largely fiscally neutral With the Trump administration focused on increasing defense spending  Pentagon funding would also rise  Democrats have also agreed to raise the defense budget for fiscal year 2019  Our ChoicesMarkets have warmly welcomed the announcement of midterm election results  Some market watchers think that this is largely a relief rally  since the results provided no major surprises  However  a gridlocked Congress could serve to maintain the status quo This would benefit diverse economic sectors even as spending on defense and infrastructure rises  This is why it makes sense to bet on stocks that have gained year to date and are set to move higher in the near future  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have

25384,246899,AMED,5 Stocks To Snap Up On Explosive Relative Price Strength,opinion,Investors generally gauge a stock s potential return by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally

25485,247000,AMED,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks To Strengthen Your Portfolio,opinion,In the world of business finance  leverage refers to an investment strategy that involves borrowing of funds to finance the expansion of the business  purchase of inventory and other assets as well as supporting other aspects of business operations  Financial leverage is the amount of debt that exists in the capital structure of a company Per the theory of cost of capital  a company s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity used to finance its capital projects  A comparative analysis of the same theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper  especially in periods of low interest rates This is because when a company resorts to debt financing  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period  However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well  Consequently  debt financing has emerged as a more popular financing option among the majority of corporations But debt financing has its share of drawbacks  The problem arises when leverage becomes exorbitant   A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which tend to affect the company s bottom line Of course  this does not mean that debt financing should be a taboo in corporate financing  Nevertheless  given the current macroeconomic scenario in the United States  in favor of interest rate hikes  the market seems to be not so suitable for borrowersTherefore  to safeguard their portfolio from losses  the real challenge for an investor is to determine whether the organization s debt level is sustainable  This is because a debt free corporation is rare to find  Historically  several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt to equity ratio is one of the most common ratios Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company With the first quarter reporting in its last lap  investors must be targeting stocks that are exhibiting solid earnings growth  But if the stocks bear a high debt to equity ratio  in times of economic downturns  their so called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare Considering this  it will be wise for investors to select companies with low leverage  These are financially more secure and immune to financial bankruptcy The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure safe returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1 or 2  Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have a proven

25644,247159,AMED,Will Envision Healthcare s Growth Strategies Help The Stock ,opinion,"Envision Healthcare Corp    NYSE EVHC   has disclosed the status of a number of initiatives undertaken for its long term growth  These initiatives were taken to offset headwinds such as low patient volumes  increased leverage  high operating expense and a weak operating environment 
Strategic Initiatives
The company has appointed James D   Denny  Shelton as lead independent director  effective immediately  It expects to gain from Shelton s rich experience  Also  for better corporate governance Envision Healthcare will amend its articles of incorporation provided for the election of directors on an annual basis  Changes to this effect will cause the directors to be appointed for a three year term  in 2018 annual meeting   who will then be reelected every year for one year term 
Furthermore  the company plans to modify its bylaws to incorporate proxy access  which implies that a long term share holder of the company will have the ability to nominate a limited number of director candidates  This  in turn  will lead to a better corporate governance and provide more powers to its long term shareholder s  thereby increasing their trust in the company 
Envision Healthcare provided an update on its pending divestiture of its medical transportation company   American Medical Response   which is under progress  The company will benefit from the recently enacted tax act  thereby leading to an increase in net proceeds from the sale to  2 1 billion from  1 9 billion as envisaged earlier 
Also  the tax reform will cause a reduction in estimated tax liability association with this divestiture transaction  The company intends to use the funds from this sale to pay off its debt  which is expected to improve its balance sheet position 
In fact  the company stands to gain from Trump s tax reform as well  which lowers the corporate tax rate to 21  from 35   Additionally  it expects that capital expenditures for continuing operations will be eligible for accelerated depreciation  thus allowing higher deductions in the initial years of an asset s life 
This is an important tax incentive that supports a business for purchasing new assets  Further  Envision Healthcare anticipates net interest expenses to be deductible based on thresholds specified in the law 
For fiscal 2018  the company stated that it is on track to generate  50 million of savings from operational improvements  Its operating margins for 2018 will also witness an improvement of 50 basis points from reduced overhead expenses and more efficient revenue cycle management  Envision Healthcare intends to make additional cost saves from effective labor cost management 
Moreover  it reaffirmed the company s financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017  which included revenue of  1 88 billion to  2 02 billion  adjusted EBITDA of  182 million to  202 million and adjusted EPS of  0 44 to  0 54  This excludes an anticipated benefit from a reduction of net deferred tax liabilities associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
Will These Initiatives Assist a Bounce Back 
Envision Healthcare s headwinds weighed on its stock price which tanked 46  in a year s time  significantly underperforming the  s decline of 4  

 
We believe these initiatives will be able to relieve the company and help it to address its low profitability  But we choose to remain on sidelines til the effects of these strategies are reflected in earnings numbers 
Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider
Envision Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the healthcare space are Centene Corp    NYSE CNC    Amedisys Inc    NASDAQ AMED   and Chemed Corp    NYSE CHE    While Centene sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   the other two stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

25699,247214,AMED,What s In The Cards For DaVita  DVA  Stock In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc    NYSE DVA   is expected to report third quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 7  after market close 
Last quarter  the company delivered earnings of 92 cents per share  which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents  Over the last four quarters  it delivered an average earnings beat of 1 83  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
DaVita is a leading provider of dialysis services to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure  The company s Kidney Care business is expected to perform well in the quarter under review owing to its continuous investments in capital efficient technologies 
Steady overseas expansion through strategic alliances and acquisition of dialysis centers has played a key role in boosting the company s growth  We believe that DaVita s constant efforts to upgrade its quality of services  global expansion and active acquisitions are key positives DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

    
Operating cash flow is expected to remain strong in the quarter on the back of an improved performance of the Kidney Care business as well as the capitated care business  Overall  management projected DaVita s operating income for fiscal 2017 in the range of  1 675  1 775 billion  Of this  the company expects operating income of  1 565  1 625 billion for Kidney Care business  Operating cash flow projection for fiscal 2017 is expected at  1 750  1 950 billion 
On the flip side  the company expects to incur significant operating losses within its International business due to lower than anticipated clinic acquisitions and slower operating ramp of acquired clinics  This should get reflected in DaVita s third quarter performance 
Additionally  the issue that may impact the company s bottom line in the to be reported quarter is the ongoing cost inflation that has continued to outpace the rate increases the company received from its payers   Also  uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company s concerns 
Coming to estimate revisions  the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings being stable at 94 cents per share over the last three months 
Earnings Whispers
Despite solid prospects  our quantitative model does not conclusively point to an earnings beat for the stock this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  this is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  DaVita has an Earnings ESP of  0 38   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 95 cents is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate at 94 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  DaVita carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks of 4 and 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision 
Stocks to Consider
Here are three companies worth considering as per our proven model  these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this quarter   
Amedisys  Inc    NASDAQ AMED   has an Earnings ESP of  0 62  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Myriad Genetics  Inc    NASDAQ MYGN   has an Earnings ESP of  1 61  and a Zacks Rank of 2

25727,247242,AMED,Why Envision Healthcare  EVHC  Could Be Positioned For A Slump,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Envision Healthcare Corporation   NYSE EVHC    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  further confirms weakness in EVHC A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen 10 estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from  3 39 a share a month ago to its current level of  2 85 Also  for the current quarter  Envision Healthcarehas seen six downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to 56 cents a share from 99 cents over the past 30 days   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 37 6  in the past month Envision Healthcare Corporation Price and Consensus   So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Medical industry  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Amedisys  Inc    NASDAQ AMED    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and may be a better selection at this time  You can see  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2017-11-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-envision-healthcare-evhc-could-be-positioned-for-a-slump-200265389,200265389
25728,247243,AMED,Here s Why You Should Add Amedisys  AMED  To Your Portfolio,opinion,Amedisys  Inc    NASDAQ AMED   has been gaining investors  confidence on consistent positive results  Over the past three months  the company s share price has outperformed the broader   The stock has gained 13 2   as against the broader industry s 10 5  decline  Also  the company has outperformed the S P 500 s 6 5  gain This renowned home health and hospice services provider has a market cap of  1 91 billion  The company s five year projected growth rate is also favorable at 18 5  compared with the industry s 11 8  With solid prospects  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment The company s estimate revision trend for the current year has been positive  In the past 60 days  five analysts revised their estimates upward with no movement in the opposite direction  Resultantly  earnings estimates increased around 0 9  to  2 23 per share over the same time frame Per  system  Amedisys has a Value Score of B that reflects the company s solid prospects  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2 offer the best upside potential   Additionally  the company exhibits a VGM Score of B  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum  Per our research  VGM Score is simply a weighted combination of these parameters and is a comprehensive tool that allows investors to filter through the standard scoring system and pick the winning stocks In this regard  Amedisys has a favorable Price Earnings to Growth  PEG  ratio of 1 36 as compared with the broader industry s 1 64  With an attractive three to five year projected earnings growth rate of 18 5   Amedisys again scores higher than the industry s 11 8  The company also boasts better leverage ratios when compared with  the broader industry  Amedisys has a favorable Debt Equity ratio of 0 16 compared with the industry s 0 30 Let s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one Amedisys posted a solid third quarter 2017 results  wherein earnings and revenues improved year over year Moreover  the company has a long term strategy to evolve from a traditional home health and hospice care company to one that is focused on bringing home a continuum of care  This is because Amedisys intends to better serve patients and diversify sources of payment so as to become less reliant on Medicare  In this regard  the company experienced an improvement in non Medicare revenues while Medicare revenues declined within the Home Health division in the third quarter Also  a favorable 2018 Home Health Final Rule buoys optimism in the stock  According to a report by HEALTHCAREfirst  the 2018 Home Health Final Rule was finalized without the implementation of the Home Health Groupings Model   HHGM   scheduled for rollout in 2019  HHGM is an alternative case mix adjustment methodology that would have used 30 day periods  rather than 60 day episodes  Going forward  the company expects to implement this rule  which might impact the business We believe that the home health industry is poised to grow significantly in the near term driven by the positive demographic trend in the United States  Meanwhile  Amedisys should continue to benefit from the aging demographics of the U S  population and the need for higher acuity patients in a home nursing environment  Also  Amedisys  Personal Care segment has been stabilizing and performing well as the company integrates recent tuck in acquisitions  Moreover  Amedisys is looking forward to huge growth prospects within this segment   With the recently announced Intercity acquisition  the company has closed a total of three personal care acquisitions since last September and is awaiting regulatory approval to complete the buyout of East Tennessee Personal Care Services Furthermore  the company s strong cash balance position bolsters investor s confidence in the stock On the flip side  escalating operating expenses and declining gross margin continue to pose threats  Also  an intense competitive landscape and regulatory concerns remain challenging in the home health and hospice industry Other Key PicksSome other top ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express  Inc    NASDAQ PETS    Myriad Genetics  Inc    NASDAQ MYGN   and Luminex Corporation   NASDAQ LMNX    While  PetMed and Myriad sport a Zacks Rank  1  Luminex Corporation carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see PetMed has a long term expected earnings

25729,247244,AMED,Envision Healthcare Down More Than 50  This Year  Here s Why,opinion,"Envision Healthcare Corp    NYSE EVHC   is suffering low patient volumes  increased leverage  high operating expenses and a weak operating environment 
These headwinds induced the company s earnings miss in the third quarter  The bottom line also declined year over year 
The company s negatives have taken a toll on its share price  tumbling 53  year to date compared with the industry s decline of 11  

So What s Dragging Down the Stock 
Decline in Guidance  For 2017  the company lowered its adjusted EBIDTA guidance  The full year guidance calls for EBIDTA of  922 million  down from the previously guided range of  1 02  1 04 billion  This decrease is attributable to the downward revision in same contracts and new contracts outlook in the Physician Services segment  This unfavorable sentiment around the stock raises a question on the company s ability to perform  spreading skepticism among its investors 
Soft Physicians Services Segment  The unit generating most of the company s revenues carries a weak outlook for 2017  An expected decline in same contract outlook and net new contract revenues will weigh on the segment s revenues  Same contract assumptions were driven by lower than expected seasonal anesthesia rate increases from the first half of 2017 to the second half  Lower than expected emergency department rate increase  net volume growth and higher labor and other supportive costs will keep the segment s earnings under pressure 
High Leverage  The company s total debt has been on the rise for the past many years  As of Dec 31  2016  the company had total debt of approximately  5 79 billion  up 145 6  year over year  For the first nine months  the same increased 8 4  from 2016 year end level  The rise in leverage has consequently led to a spike in interest expenses  which increased from  17 million in 2012 to  142 4 million in 2016   The same for the first nine months of 2017 soared 77  year over year  Such high debt levels increase the leverage risk and mounting interest costs may dent the company s margins   
High Operating Expenses  The company s operating expenses have been increasing over the past many years  Most alarming is the rate of rise of operating expenses  exceeding the revenue growth rate  To be specific  operating expenses escalated at an average rate of 54  from 2012 to 2016 while revenues grew at an average rate of 43 4  during the same time frame  The same trend was seen in the first nine months of 2017 with expenses skyrocketing by 183 4  and sadly  surpassing even the revenue growth of 152   This growth in expenses has put pressure on the bottom line and is likely to persist in the coming quarters too 
Though the company has undertaken a strategic review of a broad range of alternatives to enhance shareholder value  the stock will remain dull until the results show sustained profitability 
Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider
Envision Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Some better ranked stocks in the healthcare space are Amedisys Inc    NASDAQ AMED    Chemed Corp    NYSE CHE   and Centene Corp    NYSE CNC    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

25871,247386,AMED,Republicans Take Last Shot At Obamacare  5 MedTech Stocks To Buy,opinion,Rep  Steve Scalise meant business when he had said   We are not giving up on repealing and replacing Obamacare    Following a series of futile attempts by the GOP to dismantle the Affordable Care Act  the Republicans have pledged another solid shot at abolishing the program Notably  the fate of Obamacare will be decided on September 30  No matter what the future holds  the day will provide investors a clear picture of where the MedTech industry is headed The Graham Cassidy BillThis  last ditch  Republican effort to end Obamacare has been led by Senators Lindsey Graham  Bill Cassidy  Dean Heller  Ron Johnson and former U S  Senator Rick Santorum  who unveiled a new legislation to reform health care last week The new legislation  which is commonly referred to as the Graham Cassidy Heller Johnson   GCHJ   bill or the Graham Cassidy bill  proposes the replacement of Obamacare with a block grant that will be given to states every year to help individuals pay for health care The bill will allow states to decide how the funds will be used for health care needs of their citizens  States will also get more flexibility as well as resources to create healthcare systems with lower premiums and expanded coverage Why Value Investing As the MedTech space has been facing increased volatility as of late  we believe adopting an inherently defensive investment strategy would be apt  The goal is to focus on stocks that are trading at enticing discounts  and those that have a market value lower than their intrinsic value  Such stocks may not make it to the list of bigwigs  However  at this point in time when the economy might look up again  it seems prudent to invest in stocks that are currently trading cheap  After the final decision on the latest Obamacare replacement bill is announced  the market might get into a bullish run  In light of this  value stocks are expected to hold enough potential to rake in more returns  unlike expensive growth stocks Go Easy on the Pocket  5 StocksGiven the current volatile healthcare environment  we have picked five companies that are great value bargains and are poised for stellar gains  Zacks has designed the unique  to compare each parameter of a stock with its peer group to analyze whether the stock is

25891,247406,AMED,Why Should Investors Add Amedisys  AMED  To Their Portfolio ,opinion,"Amedisys  Inc    NASDAQ AMED    a leading home health and hospice services company is on a healthy growth trajectory of late  It has rallied 20 2  year to date  ahead of the S P 500 s 11 8  gain and the broader  s decline of 4 2  
The stock has a market cap of  1 8 billion  The company s long term expected growth rate is also favorable at 18 2  compared with the 12 3  gain of the broader industry 
With solid growth prospects  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock is an attractive pick at present 

Let s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one 
The company s estimate revision trend for the current year has been positive  In the past 60 days  five analysts moved upward with no movement in the opposite direction  The magnitude of estimate revision increased around 5 7  to  2 21 per share over the same time frame 
Of late  Amedisys has been riding high on solid potential of new opportunities within its home health and hospice services segments  We are also encouraged by the company s long term strategy to evolve from a traditional home health and hospice care company to a focused unit  bringing home a continuum of care to serve patients with better services and diversify sources of payment to become less reliant on Medicare  
The company has been witnessing growth in the personal care segment on the back of synergies from acquisitions  It recently made a slew of strategic acquisitions   the recent one being that of Intercity Home Care in Massachusetts  slated for close on Oct 1 
The home health industry is poised for substantial growth in the long term  driven by the positive demographic trend in the United States  The company is expected to continue to benefit from ageing demographics of the U S  population and higher acuity patients in a home nursing environment  
Notably  the company is on track to fortify its footprint in the market place  Lately  it announced completion of National Readmission Prevention Collaborative certification program by a clinical programs team  which handles home healthcare programs 
Additionally  the company s strong cash balance position bolsters our confidence in the stock 
On the flip side  we anticipate synergies from the Tenet Healthcare  NYSE THC  acquisition to escalate costs and operating expenses  weighing on the company s margins  Also  an intense competitive landscape and regulatory concerns continue to pose challenges in the home health and hospice industry

26053,247568,AMED,IDEXX Laboratories  IDXX   Great Growth Pick  Here s Why,opinion,"Growth investors generally have high risk tolerance and are continuously on the lookout for above average growth stocks that are expected to outperform the broader industry with respect to revenues  earnings or cash flow 
However  this apparently simple growth investment technique has some drawbacks and lack of proper understanding of the strategy may often lead to short listing of growth stocks that are a misfit to the portfolio  Since growth investors seek capital gains  they tend to remain exposed to high risks 
In a bull market  it has been popularly said that a stock keeps scaling new highs until some event works against it  However  the timing of the pullback is hard to gauge 
Insight into Zacks Methodology
Our latest  has made the task quite simple  It helps us choose stocks that have a solid performance record and might therefore prove to be a great choice for investors 
Our Growth Style Score highlights all evaluation metrics and represents them as one score that cautions investors regarding  growth traps  and helps them find stocks that have high growth potential 
Meanwhile  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  reflects an upward trend in the stock s earnings estimates  Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 
Based on this  we have identified a candidate IDEXX Laboratories   NASDAQ IDXX    with a Zacks Rank  2 and a Growth Score of A  which may prove to be a solid growth pick 
What s Working in Favor of IDEXX Laboratories 
IDEXX Laboratories has a favorable VGM Score of B  Under the Zack Style Score system  V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum  The VGM Score is simply a weighted combination of these parameters and is a comprehensive tool that allows investors to filter through the standard scoring system and pick the winning stocks

26055,247570,AMED,3 Excellent Value Picks As Political Chaos Grips MedTech,opinion,"MedTech continues to face challenges since the Republicans have taken over the House and Senate  Things started getting dramatic since President Trump forged ahead with his efforts to completely repeal Obamacare  After quite a few rounds of failing attempts  the Trump government resorted to the  skinny repeal  of the Obamacare Act 
The Consequences of the Skinny Repeal
The Trump administration had been targeting the  individual mandate    employer mandate  and  Cadillac taxes  under the skinny repeal  
However  last month witnessed increased political conundrum as the Republicans lost the debate over skinny repeal of the Obamacare Act  largely because of the three Republican who voted in favor of the existing Healthcare Act 
Their view may partially be based on the latest cost estimate by the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation s  JCT   As per the report  with the rollback of the Affordable Care Act  ACA  or Obamacare the number of uninsured people will increase by 17 million in 2018  This will further intensify to 27 million more uninsured in 2020 and will increase to 32 million in 2026 
As per the voters who were against the skinny repeal  revoking of the individual and employer mandate could have indirectly affected the customer base within the healthcare as it would have resulted in expensive health insurance and contracted health insurance coverage 
However  the industry is looking forward to the abolishment of the Cadillac tax  40  excise tax on high cost healthcare plans   Though the Trump administration has been targeting a complete annulment of the tax  it has been able to delay the Cadillac tax until 2026 
Is There a Silver Lining for MedTech 
While the healthcare fraternity has been in a confusing state with the developments at the Capitol Hills over the past one and a half years  the MedTech industry has always been content with the new government on probabilities of full abolition of major healthcare taxes  including Cadillac tax and the 2 3  MedTech tax 
The latest delay in the Cadillac tax has to some extent come as a sigh of relief for MedTech players as it raises the possibilities that they will gradually be exempt from the 2 3  medical device tax too 
Why Choose a Value Stock 
While markets have been oscillating between hope and despair  we believe an inherently defensive investment strategy would be apt for the moment  The goal is to focus on stocks that are trading at tantalizing discounts and have a market value lower than the intrinsic value 
Such stocks may not make it to the list of prominent names  However  at a point when the economy is set to make a rebound  it is more meaningful to invest in stocks which are currently trading cheap

President Donald Trump  who is keen to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Act more popularly called Obamacare  has injected a fresh dose of uncertainty in the industry Trump s version of the policy called the American Health Care Act  AHCA  received a lukewarm response  and called for further amendments to the proposed bill  The proposed amendment calls for setting aside funds to be used in covering a portion of costs alongside insurers  This would invariably result in bringing down premium costs while accommodating more people under the healthcare umbrella Had the AHCA been passed in its original form  without the proposed amendment   around 6 10 million Americans might have lost coverage  This would invariably have resulted in shrinkage in the customer base for hospital companies as a chunk of the population would lose their healthcare coverage  If the amendment is enacted  it would be effective from Jan 1  2018  Also  the roll back of Medicaid expansion would be against the

Electronic Arts Inc   NASDAQ EA   the big video game developer  has a very beautiful  long term  couple year rising channel that broke through a double top at the 38 91 zone  The breakaway gap in this case didn t close great  but it was still up 1 43  or 3 8   on 10 6 million shares  Let s see if that pullback is a buying opportunity  and then it can make it to higher levels  Ultimately  it could be a stock in the mid to high 40 s 
SolarWinds  Inc   NYSE SWI  is a company I like a lot  It had a big run p in 2012  cracked early 2013 and was in a downtrend for a year  based out for most of 2014  and on Wednesday  it broke out  up 4 67  or 11   on 3 7 million shares  It had a big breakaway gap on volume  That s the biggest volume since February  On break out day  I would look for more upside to get up to about 51  and then see if it can punch through there 
VASCO Data Security International  NASDAQ VDSI  had another good follow through day  This stock has been great to us  It has had a beautiful run up since it was trading in the single digits  Now  it s moved up five fold since February  The next target is 28 1 2 3 4

Amedisys Inc  NASDAQ AMED  is one of our top stocks for the year  Last year it based  broke out and wedged  and then exploded  came down over a 3 month period  exploded again  ran to the top of the channel  pulled back from the top to the bottom of the channel  forming a big wedge  The hole in the big gap is the key at the 24 range  It started to move up again  and Wednesday it was a big day  up 2 54 to 31 67  or 8 7   on 674 400 shares traded  That s the biggest volume on an up day since October  It s just a tad above  and closed above  the prior high  which is important in terms of the breakaway move  Right now  the target has to be 39 39 1 2  It s probably a good swing trade  and may have a swing put on it on Thursday 
Cellectis  PARIS ALCLS   a fairly new IPO  did extremely well in the last two days  It had an explosive pop  an inside day  and Wednesday was the follow through day  up 4 54 to 40 99  3 points from the high  or 12 1 2   on 1 5 million shares  The momentum here  the base having been completed  could even run up to the mid to high 40 s before it pulls back  Looking for another an extension in the next day or so 
NeoPhotonics Corporation  NYSE NPTN   a swing trade of ours  is doing great  It popped out  pulled back perfectly  popped and flagged  and on Wednesday  it popped again for the third day in a row  up 44 cents to 8 28  or 5 6   on 1 3 million shares  Big volume  Targets are 9 3 4 and 11 1 2 12 
Silicon Motion Technology  NASDAQ SIMO  had a big pop on Wednesday  up 2 66 to 34 38  or 8 4   on 1 4 million shares  That s the best volume in a couple months  Breaking out of the wedge is important  The trendline may very well be dictated at the channel top  Short term it will be taking it up to 36 36 1 4  and then  if it extends to the top of the channel  look for it to run up to the low 40 s

MOBILEYE N V   NYSE MBLY  had a very nice day on Tuesday  up 2 31 to 48 02  or 5   on 5 2 million shares  That breaks it out of the declining topsline  and out of a consolidation  It formed a channel flag  The 50 day moving average and the trendline are on support  Look for it to take out 48 3 4  and if it gets through that  look for it to run up to 50  and then 53 going forward 
Sigma Designs  Inc   NASDAQ SIGM  was up 20 cents to 8 94  or 2 3   on 642 500 shares traded on Tuesday  It broke out on a good earnings report in after hours and ran up to 9 65  A breakout above this resistance level and it may be on its way to mid channel up around 10 1 2 11  The secondary target it at 12 1 2 3 4 
TASER International Inc   NASDAQ TASR  was up 71 cents to 33 59  or 2   on 3 million shares on Tuesday  More importantly  it broke out on Tuesday across lateral resistance  and has taken out the moving averages  All that s left is a run up to 35  That may come quickly  The long term chart shows resistance at 42  and then all the way up to the high 40 s

106817,328332,AMED,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Enphase Energy  Brookfield Business Partners  Amedisys  Pure Storage And Match Group,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 27  2020   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Enphase Energy  Inc    NASDAQ ENPH    Brookfield Business Partners L P    NYSE BBU    Amedisys  Inc    NASDAQ AMED    Pure Storage  Inc    NYSE PSTG   and Match Group  Inc    NASDAQ MTCH   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  Year of the Rat Spells Good Times for Wall Street  5 PicksIf Chinese zodiac interests you  then you might want to know that the calendar will soon change from the Year of the Pig to the Year of the Rat  But does that also mean a change in the performance of the U S  stock market  After all  the Year of the Pig  mostly considered to be a symbol of fortune and opulence  has been favorable for the U S  stock market  In fact  U S  stocks scaled north during the period  defying skeptics who expected the bull market to be upended by trade war threats and global economic slowdown  While the broader stock market  as predominantly measured by the S P 500 rallied almost 30  last year  it seems to be gaining momentum this year as well But  will Year of the Rat bring good tidings as well  Historically  during the Year of the Rat  the S P 500 s performance has been slightly better than the index s overall average of 11 4   according to Stansberry Pacific Research   What s more  there is an array of positive factors that should help the U S  stock market continue its upward journey  The Trump administration s recent phase one trade deal with China will lessen the burden on global economic growth created by trade imbalances  Lest we forget  the United States and China together account for 35  to 40  of the world s economy  and thus have a significant influence on international growth  And since the negotiations have gone well between the countries  business confidence will improve  driving capital expenditure and in turn stocks Consumer outlays have also remained healthy  led by record low unemployment rate and wage gains  and should certainly help the economy expand this year  Per the Commerce Department  consumer outlays increased 0 3  in December from a month earlier  At the same time  retail sales for the November December period increased 4 1  to  730 2 billion  added the National Retail Federation  All these indicate that households have enough spending capabilities to keep the economy expanding at a steady pace in the near term By the way  the current low interest environment should make borrowing manageable helping companies invest and grow  This in turn should help the economy gain momentum  To top it  the Fed is expected to keep its monetary policy on hold after trimming rates three consecutive times last year to stimulate the economy  Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said that there is no immediate need to hike the federal fund s rate unless there is a constant rise in inflation Some skeptics  meanwhile  may say that the recent spread of a contagious disease in China may weigh heavily on stocks  But China s efforts to control the viral outbreak and the World Health Organization s decision to refrain from declaring China s coronavirus outbreak a global emergency bolstered investors  sentiments 5 Biggest GainersGiven the bullishness  investing in stocks that can make the most of the Year of the Rat seems judicious  We have  thus  selected five stocks that are poised to yield stellar returns this calendar year that constitute bulk of the Year of the

106818,328333,AMED,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks This Earnings Season,opinion,In corporate finance  leverage is a popular investment strategy that involves borrowing of funds to expand business  purchase inventory and other assets as well as support different aspects of business operations  This borrowing can be through equity or debt financing Now  the theory of cost reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper  especially in periods of low interest rates  This is because when a company resorts to debt financing  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period Yet  debt financing has its share of drawbacks  Particularly  one should keep in mind that debt financing is a feasible option as long as the companies succeed in generating a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate  Exorbitant debt financing might even cause bankruptcy in a worst case scenario Nevertheless  this should not discourage investors from spending on U S  stocks since debt has been part of the economy since its foundation and yet the country leads others Since  a debt free entity is rare to find  we should focus on those carrying low debt levels  Historically  several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears  Debt to equity ratio is one of the most common ratios Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company With the Q4 reporting cycle gaining pace slowly  investors must be looking for stocks that have a history of reporting solid results  However  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth  without considering their debt level  is not a wise move The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1 or 2   Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 24 stocks that made it through the screen Gibraltar Industries Inc    NASDAQ ROCK
