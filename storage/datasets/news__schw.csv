195009,416525,SCHW,Will Charles Schwab s Bold Moves Pay Off for Investors ,news,"Changes in the asset management business are expected to lead to more industry consolidation  Firms have been riding a long bull market  but that ride is expected to get bumpier with increased market turbulence  There are other trends afoot as well  such as a shift from active to passive investing  necessary investments in technology  and pressures toward lower fees 
These are among the trends that will force companies to explore mergers and acquisitions to gain the scale they need to compete in a more difficult environment  One of the biggest deals is Charles Schwab s  NYSE SCHW  acquisition of rival brokerage TD Ameritrade for  26 billion  The deal won t close until later this year  but if and when it s done  it will  in effect  take out a main competitor and solidify Schwab as a top three asset manager in assets under management  AUM   As of Dec  31  Schwab has  4 trillion in AUM  When you add TD Ameritrade s  1 3 trillion  Schwab would have  5 3 trillion  which would make it the third largest  behind BlackRock and Vanguard 
It was one of the  bold  moves the company has made to improve client and shareholder value  Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger said in the fourth quarter earnings release  Will it pay off for investors 


One bold move deserves another
TD Ameritrade would bring to Schwab its 12 million client accounts   1 3 trillion in assets  and  5 billion in annual revenue  It would allow Schwab to offer a wider array of products and services to this larger client base  Further  the new combined entity is expected to generate lower operating expenses as a percentage of client assets  as company officials expect to reduce costs by up to  2 billion by eliminating duplicative roles and services  as well as through downsizing real estate and administrative functions  The lower expenses will be used to invest in new products to enhance the customer experience and diversify revenue streams 
The other bold move the firm made last year was going to zero fees for commissions on trades  The move was made  among other reasons  as a result of pressure from online brokers  like Robinhood  that offer commission free trading  After Schwab s announcement in October  competitors E Trade and TD Ameritrade  among others  followed suit  The changing landscape made it harder on a firm like TD Ameritrade  which relied more on commissions  than Schwab  which is more diversified and has assets in deposits  fixed income  and other areas  
As chairman and founder Charles Schwab told CNBC back in October 

We make our money on other relationships    you might want advice  you might want fixed income or things like that    we ll make a little bit of money there  But commissions on stocks are now free      What we try to do is offer things that customers really want  and they definitely want lower prices  

Big growth in assets
That change definitely was felt as revenue from trading fees plunged 58  in the fourth quarter year over year to  86 million  The company was also hurt by a decrease in interest revenue due to the Fed rate cuts as interest revenue dipped 8   These losses were somewhat offset by a slight gain in asset management and administrative fees  Overall  net revenue was only down about 2  year over year to  2 6 billion  Schwab held the line on expenses in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year s total  Overall  net income was down 9 5  year over year in the fourth quarter  while earnings per share  EPS  dropped 4 basis points  in other words  fourth hundredths of a percentage point  year over year to  0 62  as Schwab missed analysts  estimates  For the year  EPS rose 8 1  to  2 69 
But a positive development for the firm was a massive gain in total assets  Schwab crossed the  4 trillion mark  up 6 6  in the quarter and 19 4  for the year  The strong growth in the fourth quarter was buoyed by  77 billion in net new assets and 433 000 new brokerage accounts    making it the best quarter of the year for growth 
With the bold moves  Schwab looks like a good buy as it moves forward as a major player in the new landscape of a consolidating market ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/po0g5,2069722

195011,416527,SCHW,Is Schwab U S  Broad Market ETF Stock a Buy ,news,"Last year was understandably a great year to own Schwab U S  Broad Market ETF  NYSEMKT SCHB   The exchange traded fund that tracks the total return of the Dow Jones U S  Broad Stock Market Index owns nearly 2 500 of the largest publicly traded U S  companies  so as the general stateside market rises so should Schwab U S  Broad Market ETF  It accomplished its goal in 2019  soaring 30 94  to once again come within spitting distance of the index with its wealth altering 30 96  return  
The Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  fund is a great way to grab a huge basket of stocks in a single transaction  but as one of the ETFs that the discount brokerage uses to keep its customers close and its brand name relevant  it also packs one of the lowest cost profiles in the market  Schwab U S  Broad Market ETF has an expense ratio that clocks in at a mere 0 03   giving investors more bang for their immediately diversified buck  

It s a big basket
You don t have to be a Charles Schwab customer to buy into Schwab U S  Broad Market ETF  It trades freely on the open market like any other exchange traded listing  Punch in the four letter ticker symbol into your brokerage platform of choice  and it s yours  Charles Schwab offers its own customers access to the fund without having to shell out a commission  but now that so many brokers    Charles Schwab included    offer commission free trading on all stock trading it s not as if buying through an active account at the namesake brokerage offers any material advantage   
When investors think of index funds they sometimes default to the various vehicles that mirror the iconic S P 500  There s nothing inherently wrong with that approach to keeping pace with the market  but it s limited to 500 of the larger companies in the country  Schwab U S  Broad Market ETF takes a deeper dive into the mid cap and even small cap market 
We re still talking about a weighted index fund  so its largest holdings happen to also be the country s most valuable publicly traded companies  In terms of sector representation  the giants of just three industries    information technology  healthcare  and financial services    account for a little more than half of the weighted portfolio  Investors aren t gaining a lot of exposure into some sectors including real estate and utilities  which account for less than 4  of the representation apiece  However  the point remains that Schwab U S  Broad Market ETF does give investors access to more than just blue chips in a single purchase  
Investors naturally can t expect to score returns north of 30  every year  Schwab U S  Broad Market ETF posted a 5  decline in 2018  Last year s burst was the fund s second largest annual gain over the past decade  and it has failed to post double digit returns in four of the past 10 years  Even the ETF s 13 4  annualized return over the past 10 years may also be deceiving given the historically buoyant market that we ve experienced over the past decade  
The fund also isn t a proxy for the planet  Many of the stocks in the ETF have strong global operations  but it s ultimately tethered to the health and fate of the domestic market  Schwab U S  Broad Market ETF is still a buy  It s a low cost way to own a big chunk of the U S  market  Investors just need to buy in knowing that the past year    and even the past 10 years    are above the historical ranges of the market s returns  It s a smart way to own roughly 2 500 of the market s biggest names in a single transaction ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pog94,2070642

195017,416533,SCHW,3 Top Under  100 Mutual Funds For 2020,opinion,For beginners who don t want to risk much  investing in mutual funds under  100 is a great way to get started  Obviously  there are plenty of low priced stocks but it should be noted that stocks may not always provide investors the diversity that mutual funds assure  Moreover  risks associated with penny stocks are higher  On the other hand  there are low cost mutual funds with decent returns where investors can invest as little as  100 That said  a variety of fund houses offer mutual funds with minimum initial investment amount of  3 000 or higher  For this reason  beginners generally wait to save the minimum amount  However  there is always the risk of losing out on returns due to a late start  To counter this cost hurdle  one must begin by buying low cost funds However  finding mutual funds under  100 can be cumbersome  This is because individual investors  who are just starting out  might find it difficult to screen best no load mutual funds for  100 or less Notably  a  100 bet will make more sense when the bulk of the amount is invested and no charges are paid from it  Funds that carry no sales load and have relative low expense ratio should be preferred Although Vanguard Investments and Fidelity Investments offer some of the best no load funds  their minimum initial investments are as high as  3 000 and  2 000  respectively  Beginners are not always fortunate to have a couple of thousand dollars at their disposal However  prominent firms such as BlackRock  NYSE BLK   Inc  and The Charles Schwab Corporation  NYSE SCHW  offer several high quality  no load funds with minimum initial investments of  100 or less  Mutual funds are thus an affordable option for diversity apart from being a safer investment bet Why Mutual Funds Mutual funds are great options for investors looking for a relatively less risky way to earn at least more than what fixed income instruments offer  Money from individuals and even organizations are invested in stocks  bonds  or other assets covering diverse industries globally One of the benefits of mutual funds is that these allow a small investor to invest in a basket of securities at one go  Investors need not worry about investing a large chunk in securities separately  Moreover  these are less risky than any individual asset class as underperformance of a security gets mitigated by outperformance of others in the portfolio  In addition to asset diversification  mutual funds also provide liquidity  economies of scale and are professionally managed 3 Best Funds to Buy NowGiven such circumstances  we have highlighted three funds carrying a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  that investors should consider  Moreover  these funds have encouraging three and five year returns  Additionally  the minimum initial investment is within  100 We expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future  Remember  the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors to identify potential winners and losers  Unlike most of the fund rating systems  the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is not just focused on past performance  but also on the likely future success of the fund Laudus U S  Large Cap Growth Fund  seeks long term capital appreciation  and invests at least 80  of its net assets in equity securities

195041,416557,SCHW,Wall Street Week Ahead  History suggests rally may slow for U S  stocks in 2020,news,By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    The outsized rally in the U S  stock market this year may give way to a more muted performance in 2020 if history is any guide  The benchmark S P 500 is up nearly 28  for the year  which if the market closed this week for the year  would mark the second best annual performance for the index since 1997   However  investors who are hoping the rally will continue charging ahead through next year may be disappointed  The S P 500 has returned an average of 6 6  in the year following a rally of 20  or more since 1928  slightly below the 7 6  return in all years  according to research from Bespoke Investment Group   Fund managers and strategists say there are several reasons to believe that the stock market will not continue on a path of notching double digit annual returns like it did during the late  90s tech bubble   We re up a lot this year  but we had a historically bad 4th quarter last year   said Ryan Detrick  senior market strategist for LPL Financial   This isn t because of spectacular growth in the economy but the market realizing that we re not going to have a recession    The S P 500 posted its biggest drop since the 2008 financial crisis last year as investors worried that the trade war between the United States and China would push the global economy into a recession  The Federal Reserve s decision to change course in early January from its path of raising interest rates helped fuel the rally in the stock market this year   The Fed also helped spark a bond rally that pushed 10 year Treasury yields near historic lows and boosted dividend paying stocks  further pointing to concerns about the strength of the U S  economy  said Liz Ann Sonders  chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW     GRAPHIC  S P 500 vs U S  bonds      There are not a lot of investors in the bond markets losing their shirts because the economy is running ahead of expectations   she said   The November presidential and congressional elections will likely weigh on politically sensitive sectors like healthcare as 2020 progresses  Sonders said  adding another market headwind that could prevent another string of outsized gains like the late 1990s   You had a bunch of strong years back then because we were in the midst of a tech bubble and there was no cap on valuations  Now we have real legitimate companies but there s not the same sign of excess valuation   she said   Few on Wall Street expect a bear market in 2020  There are few signs of a recession looming in the year ahead  while the market has seemed unfazed by issues such as President Donald Trump s impeachment or ongoing trade tensions  said Jonathan Golub  chief U S  equity strategist at  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  Securities    Given historically low interest rates and risk premiums  we believe valuations have further to run   he said  He added that he expects the S P 500 to end 2020 near 3 425  a roughly 7  gain from its Thursday trading price   Investors may realize larger gains by investing in smaller companies next year  said Steven Chiavarone  a portfolio manager of the Federated Global Allocation fund   Large cap stocks in the S P 500 are over valued compared with the smaller companies in the Russell 2000 index  he said  At the same time  the Russell 2000 slightly underperformed the larger index this year by posting a 23 2  gain  leaving it primed for a  catch up trade  given that smaller companies tend to benefit more from low interest rates  he said    We think there s a chance that you will see upside surprises from earnings next year and that could draw investors back to an asset class they ve been overlooking   said Chiavarone ,2019-12-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/wall-street-week-ahead-history-suggests-rally-may-slow-for-us-stocks-in-20-2045887,2045887

195075,416591,SCHW,Most Loved  and Hated  Quant Trade Lures  3 Billion to ETFs,news," Bloomberg     It s one of the most polarizing strategies there is  yet betting on value stocks is back in vogue for investors in exchange traded funds 
More than  3 billion poured into ETFs that focus on undervalued companies in October  the most this year  data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show  The Vanguard Value ETF was the biggest beneficiary  adding close to a third of that amount  The fund rose 1  at 2 18 p m  in New York Friday  Just this week  the SPDR S P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF saw its largest inflow since December 
Buying cheap stocks has been a losing strategy for much of the last decade  The S P 500 Growth Index has outperformed the equivalent measure of value by more than 80 basis points over that time frame  prompting some traders to declare that this style of investing is dead  But others remain convinced that the approach is due for a renaissance  particularly as the stock rally shows some fatigue after reaching a record 
 Every time the market has set a new high  something has come along to take it down   said Stephen Cucchiaro  chief investment officer and founder of Boston based 3Edge Asset Management  which oversees more than  900 million   There s a lot more upside in these undervalued markets  and we wouldn t be chasing these overvalued markets  
ETF investors seem to agree  While value funds added money in October  growth ETFs saw withdrawals for a fourth straight month    the longest streak in more than three years  A gauge of value stocks outperformed growth by almost 1 percentage point in October 
For Cucchiaro  who set up 3Edge three years ago after founding an ETF focused advisory firm that was acquired by  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  Corp  in 2010  it s a signal of the time to rotate  His valuation models    which look at price versus sales  rather than the price to earnings ratio    show U S  equities are the most stretched since the late 1990s 
He s looking overseas as a result  particularly at Japan  where Cucchiaro says policy makers are getting savvy to the importance of managing the yield curve  In the U S   small cap value stocks are appealing  according to him  That s a position that Michael Burry    whose bet against mortgage securities was depicted in  The Big Short     has also championed

195076,416592,SCHW,Five new life lessons from Charles Schwab,news," The writer is a Reuters contributor  the opinions expressed are his own  
By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK Reuters    When  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  stares intently at his smartphone  you can be sure of one thing  He is checking the stock market 
The 82 year old has been in a heated love affair with stocks and capitalism ever since starting his brokerage back in 1971 
Schwab sat down with Reuters to talk about his latest book   Invested   in which he talks about the bumpy  winding  unlikely path that landed him where he is today 
A few key lessons he learned along the way 
1  While you re young  get out there and work every job you can 
You might be surprised to learn some of the wacky gigs from Schwab s teenage years  Plucking duck feathers  raising hens  collecting Coke bottles from under grandstands  driving a tractor at a sugar beet farm  working as an oilfield roustabout  Those early moments taught him as much about human nature as anything else in his career 
 Dealing with people on that level  you get a real understanding of them   he said   When I was working on the beet farm alongside Hispanic agricultural workers  they may not have been able to speak any English  but they were real people with real families and real feelings  I ve been lucky to have experiences like that  and I think all parents should get their teenagers out doing that kind of stuff  
2  Take the risk   even if you are not totally ready 
When trading commissions were first deregulated decades ago  no one   including Schwab himself   truly knew how a low cost brokerage strategy was going to play out  But he went for it  and his current  7 8 billion net worth  according to Forbes  indicates how well that bet paid off 
His motto   85  ready is good enough   he says   If you re 85  of the way there  then make the decision to go for it  Hesitation doesn t do anybody any good  
3  Turn your weakness into advantage 
Many might not know that Schwab is dyslexic  and still reads slowly today  Even at 82  you can tell that his childhood experience cut him to the quick   Dyslexia wasn t even defined when I was a kid   he said   You were either slow  or stupid  People said things like   Why don t you do better  Just work harder   
But a remarkable number of people with learning differences  such as Virgin Group s Richard Branson and Apple s Steve Jobs  turned into extraordinary business leaders   perhaps because of that ability to look at things differently  process events in new ways  and see things others don t see 
4  Do the hard things 
Another of his lowest career moments  When the Schwab board let go former Chief Executive David Pottruck  Not only because it was a delicate situation with a longtime colleague  but because it meant Schwab himself had to reassume the title of CEO 
 That was a really down time   he remembered   It felt like a fire hose of water coming at my head  becoming a CEO again at sixtysomething   But a public company s primary responsibility is to its shareholders  and even though it wasn t comfortable or easy  Schwab did what he felt had to be done 
5  Do not think in terms of family dynasties 
Schwab has five kids and 13 grandchildren  so you might think that he envisions an army of next gen Schwabs taking over the company after he s gone  Not so 
 They have to follow their passions  whatever that might be   he said   If you want to be a teacher  be a teacher  There s no need for them to work in finance  In fact only one of my children is in the business   my eldest daughter Carrie  who runs our foundation  She actually started for us as a file clerk  
For whoever ends up running the show  he hopes that this new book can be a sort of GPS  steering them in the right direction   I know full well that there is an end zone out there for me someplace   he quipped   I wrote this so that employees and customers would know where we came from  and understand the values we talk about  Maybe it could be a kind of Bible going forward   for the next chapter  after I m gone  ",2019-11-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/five-new-life-lessons-from-charles-schwab-2014983,2014983
195077,416593,SCHW,Markets hope for positive signs from Trump trade speech,news,"By Jeff Mason and April Joyner
NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump is scheduled to discuss the country s trade policy at the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday  and the markets are likely to hang on every word 
Trump s lunchtime address at the club  which has hosted U S  presidents including Woodrow Wilson and John F  Kennedy  as well as foreign leaders like former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev  and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang   will be closely watched by investors anxious for any positive news about his administration s long running trade war with China 
 You can expect the president to highlight how his policies of lower taxes  deregulation  and fair and reciprocal trade have supported the longest economic recovery in U S  history with record low unemployment  rising wages  and soaring consumer confidence   White House spokesman Judd Deere said  He declined to give further details 
U S  stock markets have hit record highs in recent weeks on hopes the White House and Beijing are close to a trade deal that could go a long way toward dispelling the uncertainty dogging the global economy  Last week  officials from both sides said they had a deal to roll back tariffs  only to have Trump deny any deal was agreed on 
A positive speech on U S  China trade would likely satisfy market participants even without specific details of the  Phase 1  agreement under negotiation  said Jim Paulsen  chief investment officer at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis 
 It still feels like we re pretty close to having something done   Paulsen said on Monday   Even if it s meaningless  it will be meaningful  
More than 1 350 people are expected to attend the speech  according to the club s spokeswoman  Erin Klem 
Not everyone thought Trump s speech to the 112 year old club  which has served as a venue for major economic policy addresses  would be seen as constructive by investors 
Randy Frederick  vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  in Austin  Texas  had little hope Trump s speech would mark an end to uncertainty  It remains notoriously hard to predict whether Trump will take a positive or negative tone on trade 
 Whatever uncertainty exists today will exist tomorrow also   he said  adding that if Trump were to say he is not rolling back any tariffs  the market would react negatively 
Gregory Daco  chief U S  economist at Oxford Economics  estimated the trade war had chopped about eight tenths of a percentage point off U S  growth  After starting the year with growth running at 3 1   output throttled back to 1 9  in the third quarter  with weak business investment factoring heavily in the slowdown 
Daco questioned whether a limited trade deal with China would be enough to draw businesses back off the sidelines 




 Do you as a business make a decision that now the environment is clearer  there are less tariffs  so now you re more likely to invest  Or  if after the last three years  you re still more cautious and say  let s wait this one out    Daco said   I d favor the latter  ",2019-11-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/markets-hope-for-positive-signs-from-trump-trade-speech-2018476,2018476
195078,416594,SCHW,How to make the most of a zero commission world,news,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK  Reuters    How interested are people in trading stocks for free 
Very 
In early October  after TD Ameritrade announced it was switching to zero commissions from  6 95 on most trades  client call volume increased 20  and new client call volume shot up 40   the company said 
But that does not mean that there is a whole new cadre of day traders swapping exchange traded funds every hour  even as the likes of E Trade  Fidelity and Schwab joined the fray to offer zero commissions 
At Schwab  trading volume actually decreased in October  according to the company 
 We see zero commissions as a way to provide access and lower friction to people who want to buy in a brokerage account or elsewhere  We don t think people will trade actively   said Rob Williams  NYSE WMB   vice president of financial planning at  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  and a certified financial planner 
As investors wade cautiously into this new world of free trading  here is how to make the most of it as well as what to avoid 
 Retirement accounts
Zero commissions will not make much difference in workplace 401 k  plans  or your college savings 529 account   which heavily favor target date mutual funds that you typically set once and do not trade again until you cash out 
But you could change the way you deal with the existing balance in your rollover individual retirement account  IRA  or Roth IRA  and any new contributions you make  where clients lean more toward low cost index ETFs 
If you are a once a year contributor  you might want to think about stretching that out   known as dollar cost averaging   so you are not dependent on how the market is doing on any one particular day 
 I think this is a great opportunity for those folks to dollar cost average and invest in smaller increments and get involved in stocks that you might not have gotten involved in before   said Josh Rowe Heupler  general manager of investing for LendingTree 
You can also save money rebalancing  which you need to do if market forces sway your portfolio away from your long term goals 
At the investment management firm Rebalance  clients are saving about  35 a pop for twice yearly rebalancing  said Mitch Tuchman  managing director and chief investment officer 
 The end of commission marks the end of a conflicted way of doing business that has been in place since the beginning of the stock market  We can now put a stake in the ground and say it s dead   Tuchman said 
  Investing small amounts
Before October  if you had  100 to save  your options were not good for investing because even a  4 95 transaction fee would eat significantly into your potential returns  You might be discouraged from doing positive things  like saving in your triple tax free Health Savings Account or putting just a little bit of money into a Roth IRA 
 Many times customers don t realize that they leave their money in cash for a long time   longer than they think   said Ram Subramaniam  president of Fidelity Brokerage Services  where cash in brokerage accounts earns 1 33  at the moment   One of the first do s is to make sure whatever cash you have works for you  
  Emergency funds
Not all cash is meant to be invested  however 
 It s very prudent to have emergency funds   said Steve Quirk  vice president of trading and education at TD Ameritrade  But  that said  investors know how little interest they earn on cash  When they see the S P 500 up more than 20  for the year  they want to participate in that 
 Now you can  at least in a portion   Quirk said  because with ETFs you can get in and out in milliseconds for no cost 
As for those who worry about investors hooked on trading  Quirk draws the analogy with exercising   If health clubs were suddenly free  are we nervous that people will overexercise  You just have to do it in a prudent manner

195091,416607,SCHW,Markets dance to Trump s trade tunes,news,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Stephen Culp
NEW YORK  Reuters    The ebb and flow of trade tensions between the United States and China has roiled financial markets for months  and with the December deadline for higher U S  tariffs on Chinese goods approaching fast no asset class is immune to trade related risks 
Markets  sensitivity to trade headlines was on stark display this week 
The S P 500 index  SPX  fell 2  over the first two days of the week as the trade outlook darkened following a U S  move to impose visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province 
The benchmark stock index  however  reclaimed most of the lost ground over Wednesday and Thursday as Beijing and Washington s continued willingness to talk supported hopes that the latest talks would yield at least a partial deal 
On Thursday  the S P 500 was up 0 7  
U S  President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House on Friday  the second of two days of high level U S  China trade talks aimed at averting scheduled increases in U S  tariffs on Chinese goods 
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said China is willing to reach agreement with the United States on matters that both sides care about so as to prevent friction from leading to any further escalation  the state news agency Xinhua reported 
Despite assurances that both Washington and Beijing want a trade deal investors are acutely sensitive to the very real risk that the latest round of trade talks could end without a deal 
Equity investors in particular have been hyper sensitive to every trade related headline  boosting stocks on any sign of news that bodes well for a trade deal while pulling the market down on the first sign of bad news 
Any significant escalations of trade tensions have been followed by sharp pull backs in U S  stocks  as seen in May  when President said he would raise tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on  200 billion of Chinese imports 
Graphic  U S  China trade war timeline   
Currency markets have also been swayed by trade headlines  Increased trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have generally been supportive of the dollar as investors view the United States to be in better shape than its rivals to weather a trade war 
The dollar index  DXY  which measures the greenback against six major currencies  is up nearly 3  for the year  It recently hit a 28 month high 
International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen  euro  British pound  Swiss franc  Mexican peso  Brazilian real  Russian ruble  Canadian  Australian and New Zealand dollars  have boosted their bullish bets against the dollar to a 14 week high  according to CFTC data 
 That s a safe haven play   said Alfonso Esparza  senior currency analyst at OANDA in Toronto 
 It s not that they are totally confident in the U S  economy  it s just that the U S  dollar being a reserve currency gives them a bit of a safety advantage   he said 
Graphic  U S  dollar speculative positions   
Traders in the equity options market are equally anxious and on the lookout for safety 
For S P 500 options contracts expiring in December  put options  which are typically used for bearish bets  make up 14 of the top 20 largest blocks of open contracts  according to options analytics firm Trade Alert 
The put to call ratio  a measure of positioning sentiment is the most bearish in at been in at least 5 years  according to Trade Alert data 
 Big institutions use this contract primarily for hedging and they re very hedged  heavily hedged   said Randy Frederick  vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  in Austin 
 Even though we had a little bit of a pullback last week  they didn t really take any of those hedges off  and so now they re still ready and prepared for another big downturn if we get one   he said 
 I think ultimately  a lot of this has to do with the trade talks with China

So far this year  Schwab donated  375 000 to the Innovation Challenge  and  500 000 total to DonorsChoose  Of those teachers who used the resulting materials  98  said they plan to keep teaching financial literacy in schools ",2019-10-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/your-money-us-teachers-take-handson-approach-to-financial-literacy-1998605,1998605
195093,416609,SCHW,Bear Of The Day  TD Ameritrade  AMTD ,opinion,"Stockbrokers used to have it made in the shade  Prior to 1975  all brokers charged exactly the same commissions to their customers to trade stocks  Their firms had memberships to the exchanges and they were they exclusive gatekeepers  Individual investors were a captive audience  If you wanted to invest  your only choice was to pay a commission to a stockbroker 
Fixed commissions meant big profits for brokers and their firms  but they also meant that the cost of executing trades could significantly eat into investors  profits  especially on small trades 
On May 1st 1975   long known as  May Day  in the industry   the Securities and Exchange Commission mandated that brokers stop charging fixed fees and compete for business on the basis of price  paving the way for the modern discount broker 
While many  full service  brokers continued to charge large commissions  National Association of Securities Dealers regulations formerly allowed for commissions of up to 5  of the value of the trade   ex stockbroker Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  was building a company that catered to investors who didn t want advice  but simply trade execution and account services   and lower commissions 
The popularity of the internet in the mid 1990s massively increased investor access to the financial markets  For the first time  investors could access trading venues almost directly from the comfort of their own homes and without ever talking to another person  Eventually  that access would extend to smartphones and other devices  allowing trading from literally anywhere in the world 
Dozens of competing online discount brokers ensured healthy price competition and commissions fell below  10 trade  Since most of the matching of buyers and sellers happened electronically rather than on a physical trading floor  their variable cost per trade was almost zero  Once brokerage firms had the necessary connectivity in place  orders could be entered and filled with little or no human assistance 
Although these firms all developed different platforms that appealed to customers in different ways  if all a customer wanted to do was buy or sell shares of a stock  there were numerous choices available  that all functioned the same basic way  The industry had become largely commoditized Interactive Brokers  took commissions from low  to very low  to non existent when they eliminated trading commissions on stock and ETF trades altogether in September for customers who use its bare bones IBKR Lite platform 
The rest of the big discount brokers were forced to follow suit or else risk losing their customers to no cost trading 
 Side note  Interactive Brokers started as an options market making firm called  Timber Hill  that executed much the same strategy in options markets  tightening bid ask spreads until trading was unprofitable for thousands of small market makers who were forced out of business  It s a theme  
TD Ameritrade  is one of the firms that has been forced to match the move into zero commissions  They ve spent heavily in the past two decades to build an extensive collection of trading services meant to appeal to a wide range of investor   from neophytes all the way to professional individual traders 
While the brokers are counting on interest rate spreads  which remain quite wide   commissions on other types of trades like futures and options and various other fees for revenues  TD Ameritrade is likely to lose more revenue than many competitors 
While Charles Schwab  will give up about 5  of revenues as a result of the new commission structure  TD Ameritrade stands to lose up to 16  
The new commission structure won t be apparent in results for the current quarter  but estimates for next quarter have fallen 9  since the commission war began  AMTD is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Commoditization of core goods and services and subsequent price wars are among the most destructive forces for the earnings of any business  The online discount brokerage industry is suffering mightily right now and TD Ameritrade looks to be getting just about the worst of it  Investors would be wise to avoid the online brokers altogether until the smoke settles

ZURICH  Reuters    ABB  S ABBN  is pressing ahead with a review of its underperforming businesses and expects a customer slowdown and China U S  trade tensions to mean a turbulent year  its Chairman and interim Chief Executive Peter Voser told Reuters 
The Swiss engineering company is in a  heavy lifting phase   Voser said  completing the separation and sale of its power grids business to Hitachi  and on Tuesday announcing a deal to quit solar energy inverters 
Businesses which generate  3 billion of revenue  11  of ABB s total annual sales  are now under review and could be sold off or closed down  Voser told Reuters 
 We have under review some  3 billion of revenues and this solar divestment will be part of it   he said 
ABB expects a turbulent 2019  with the automotive sector s troubles hitting the industrial robot and drive maker  although demand from the food and beverages sector remains resilient 
 There are clear headwinds in some of the end markets we are operating in  therefore in some of the businesses we see a slowdown   Voser said in an interview at ABB s Zurich head office  his first since taking over as interim CEO 
 But it is not just an economic slowdown  there are also geopolitical issues     it is hard to forecast how long it could go on for  
Economic data has shown faltering factory output in Europe and concerns that U S  Chinese tensions will hurt economic growth 
Voser  a former CEO of Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa   took over as temporary boss at ABB following the sudden exit of Ulrich Spiesshofer in April 
 2019 will be a year when a lot of factors will work themselves into our results  some stranded costs  the Power Grids carve out and other portfolio decisions and some slowing down in end markets   Voser said 
 2020 will be calmer    there will be a competitive improvement after that  
 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT 
The 61 year old Swiss national  who was ABB s finance chief in the early 2000s  said he was determined to improve the performance of ABB  whose share price has underperformed rivals like  Siemens   DE SIEGn  and Schneider Electric  PA SCH  
 Our operational performance over the last few years has not been satisfactory   Voser said   Let s not dance around this issue  others have performed better 
 Many investors are in a wait and see position at this stage  looking to us to deliver  I think you will see continuous improvement delivered by our employees in the businesses and this will come faster than many expect  
Voser said there was no need to sell whole businesses  although parts   which run from circuit breakers to digital sensors and software   would be examined  and some could be sold 
Acquisitions could strengthen its remaining divisions   electrification  industrial automation  motion and robotics and discrete automation 
 Some small  and medium size additions to some of the portfolios we already have make sense  like it also may make sense to get rid of a few   he said  although ABB would not carry out  mega  acquisitions 
ABB needs to improve sales to get better margins  Voser said  although there would be no new corporate cost cutting programs 
 We have continuously improved on the cost side but not on growth  We didn t grow enough in the past   he said 
Meanwhile  Voser continues to look for a new CEO  a search which he said was running ahead of plan without saying when he expected to make an appointment 
He wanted someone with an industrial background  with the ideal candidate given time to improve ABB s fortunes 
 I think the tenure needs to be a minimum of five years  as the new CEO needs time to implement what we have started  ",2019-07-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/abbs-voser-battles-headwinds-as-pursues-overhaul-new-ceo-1918693,1918693

The Commerce Department said that retail sales rose 0 2  in January  above analysts  expectations for a flat reading  But the figures offer only modest reassurance over the health of the U S  consumer  December s figures  which were already the worst in a decade  were revised to show a drop of 1 6  in the final month of 2018  down from initial drop of 1 2

195147,416663,SCHW,Banks should quickly adopt LIBOR alternatives  Swiss expert,news,"By Angelika Gruber
ZURICH  Reuters    Banks should adopt alternative reference interest rates swiftly ahead of the expected end of Libor in 2021  said a Swiss expert and member of a panel developing the country s alternative rate for new corporate and private loans 
Switzerland  the United States  the euro zone  Britain and Japan need to replace the dominant Libor money market rate  which is being phased out after a series of scandals that led to banks being fined billions of dollars 
Switzerland is now putting the finishing touches on its transition to the Swiss Average Rate Overnight  SARON  
At a meeting in Zurich on Friday  SARON task force co chair Martin Bardenhewer said banks should not delay in making the switch from Libor 
 It is a better strategy to transition voluntarily  which means a transition before the end of 2021  and not to wait for a  Big Bang  transition which might have some additional risks   he said 
In 2017  about 6 trillion Swiss francs   6 trillion of contracts used the London Interbank Offered Rate  Libor  as a benchmark  making it by far the most important interest rate for the Swiss economy 
Libor rates spiked in September 2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers  and three years later discount brokerage  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  filed lawsuits alleging 11 major banks conspired to manipulate the benchmark rate by reporting inflated or deflated rates from which Libor was calculated each day 
Unlike Libor  SARON is not calculated from contributions by individual banks but based on actual market prices  to be determined via a platform on the Swiss stock exchange serving banks and insurers  The aim is to make it tamper proof 
Although the Libor might continue beyond 2021  Bardenhewer said  it would no longer represent a reference rate  The uncertainty over when and whether Libor will end could lead to legal problems in contracts 
 Therefore  there are very strong incentives to transition before   Bardenhewer said ",2019-03-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/banks-should-quickly-adopt-libor-alternatives-swiss-expert-1822220,1822220

195161,416677,SCHW,Technically Speaking For June 25  The Indexes Are Starting To Breakdown,opinion,"Summary
Regional manufacturing indexes are still positive but lower 
Anecdotal comments from the latest Dallas Fed manufacturing report show more weakness related to trade issues 
The equity ETFs are starting to breakdown across all asset sizes 
Regional Fed manufacturing indexes are still positive but weaker  This chart from Doug Short shows the trend  the emboldened black line is the average  

The latest Empire State report had a decline in new orders  employment  and the total workweek  The Philly Fed s index s current and future expectations were lower  the diffusion index  which measures the number of up and down indicators  was barely positive  The Richmond Fed s overall reading was up 2 points to 5  inventories were increasing and lead times were decreasing  indicating a higher level of slack in the system 
The latest Dallas manufacturing Index has a number of anecdotal comments showing tariffs hurting  emphasis added  
China tariffs are a big drain on profits  so we are covering with a general price increase July 1 
Uncertainty stifles hiring  expansion and capital expenditures  Threats of tariffs cause uncertainty 
Tariffs simply increase our raw materials prices  which we pass on to our customers in the form of price increases on new projects 
China tariffs are a big drain on profits  so we are covering with a general price increase July 1 
The Chinese tariffs remain the wildcard  as it has started to take its toll on the electronics industry in which we are heavily involved 
We are experiencing disruptions in our supply chain  some off them reportedly caused by tariffs on Chinese raw materials that have cascaded the disruption into materials we buy to manufacture some of our products  e g   food grade pigments  
Threats of new tariffs on trade with Mexico are causing uncertainty 
The Dallas Fed s district comprises the entire U S  Mexico border  so this report is catching all the negative news associated with the latest U S  Mexico tariff spat 
Liz Ann Sonders   the Chief Investment Strategist with Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW    has one of the most interesting and useful Twitter feeds  Two recent tweets highlight key developments that haven t caught as much interest as they should 
The market is betting on a very steep set of rate cuts  which means the bond market sees a lot more weakness than implied by the headline economic numbers 

This correlates with the weak readings in the Transport Index during the Spring rally 
Let s turn to today s performance table 

Another bearish day  The long end of the curve had a modest rally  Small caps were down modestly while the large cap indexes had the largest declines 
The daily charts show that the indexes are starting to break down across the size spectrum  Let s start with the micro caps 
This index has yet to move through its 200 day EMA  Over the last few days  it s fallen through the shorter EMAs  which are still below the 200 day EMA  and its short term trend line 

The  NYSE IWM  was briefly above the 200 day EMA but has since fallen through the technical landmark  It hasn t moved above it s early May high  Prices are also below the short term EMAs while breaking a short term trend line yesterday 

The mid caps have yet to move above the highs from early May  Prices broke the short term trend line yesterday 

The QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ  has yet to move above the the high from early May  Prices broke the short term trend line earlier yesterday and are now moving lower  They remain above the short term EMAs 

The SPY  NYSE SPY  hit the previous high but stalled  Prices have now fallen through the 292 area and are heading lower 
Overall  the markets are now engaging in what I refer to as a  slow motion roll over   Prices have hit highs and are now slowly starting to sell off  It s doubtful we ll see a wave of panic selling  traders are convinced that the Fed is on their side  But  it certainly looks like the markets are in a selling mood

Other major inauguration donors included casino magnate Sheldon Adelson  who gave  5 million  and investment firm founder  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  and mining investor Christopher Cline  who gave  1 million each  according to FEC filings  There is no indication any of the three are part of the investigation ",2018-12-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/federal-prosecutors-probing-trump-inauguration-spending-wsj-1721332,1721332
195166,416682,SCHW,Dreams of Higher Treasury Yields Fade as Fed Fuels Flatter Curve,news," Bloomberg     Talk of a 10 year Treasury yield heading toward 4 percent or higher is starting to seem like a distant memory 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday opted to implement its fourth interest rate hike this year and said it still expects to tighten policy in 2019  albeit at a slower pace  U S  stocks have taken a hit  pushing investors into havens such as longer dated Treasuries  with the benchmark 10 year yield falling below 2 75 percent for the first time since April 
 We ve seen the peak of Treasury yields   said Tano Pelosi  a portfolio manager at Antares Capital   The carry trades that were popular in the last few years  I think there are clear open questions now on whether they can continue  
The worry among investors is that the more the Fed hikes  the closer it takes the U S  economy toward a recession  That s manifesting itself in a yield curve close to its flattest levels since before the global financial crisis 
 As the curve keeps flattening on us  it s telling us that monetary policy is being too restrictive and that we don t have enough reserves in the system to stimulate the economy   said Scott Minerd  chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners 
Wall Street forecasters had anticipated that Fed officials would lower their median rate projection for 2019  which they did  although the central bank did indicate continued confidence in the economic outlook  Investors  faith in the Fed s tightening path has crumbled in recent weeks amid tumbling stocks and doubts about global growth 
 The stock market is recognizing the heightened risk of recession   said Jeffrey Kleintop  a strategist at  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW    Co   It s the Fed that really holds the key to the overall market and economic direction in 2019  
Here s what others are saying 
BlackRock  Not responsive enough 
What markets are showing us  is really concern  Concern that the Fed is not being responsive enough in terms of the financial conditions tightening   said Jeffrey Rosenberg  BlackRock s chief fixed income strategist 
 They are disappointed and they re worried that the Fed missed the opportunity to halt the negative risk tone across all markets 
 There s a strong desire by the Fed  as Powell reiterated here  to not let the balance sheet became an active tool of monetary policy  And there s a good reason for that  because they don t know how to calibrate that tool  
Bank of Singapore  Steady yields 
 The reduction in dots was in the right direction   said Rajeev De Mello  chief investment officer   But they could have been a bit more sympathetic to some of the signals in the market  I expect Treasury yields to be where they are now    for me  that s fairly positive for a few assets  notably higher yielding emerging market bonds such as Indonesia s and also higher yielding Asian credit  
 Credit spreads have widened out  and if yields on U S  Treasuries stay stable  that should make for interesting opportunities  
Well Fargo  EM currencies to struggle 
Strategist Brendan McKenna favors the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real  And expects emerging market currencies to struggle in a scenario of two Fed hikes next year due to slowing global economic growth  an environment typically not favoring emerging market currencies 
Perpetual  Wider outcomes 
 We ve de risked and positioned our portfolio for tightening liquidity as central banks unwind their balance sheets and interest rates go up   said Vivek Prabhu  head of fixed income   I think a lot of the volatility we ve seen in markets is partly due to the liquidity withdrawal that s seen with the Fed and other central banks like the ECB  Whilst the Fed s base case may still have a lot of validity  I think the range of economic outcomes in 2019 will be a lot wider

195173,416689,SCHW,Here Are 15 Numbers That Show How The Global Economy Is Performing,opinion,"Global economic activity has already been slowing down dramatically  and the U S  trade war with China is just going to make things worse  In so many ways  what we are witnessing in 2019 is quite reminiscent of what we witnessed as the last recession was beginning  Global exports are absolutely plummeting  auto sales are way down all over the globe  debt delinquencies are way up  and retailers are closing stores at a record pace  Even if the U S  and China were getting along  things would be rough for the global economy in the months ahead  but a full blown trade war between the two largest economies on the entire planet has the potential to be absolutely disastrous  We are truly in uncharted waters  and many believe that events are going to start accelerating very rapidly now 
Even though I write about this stuff on a daily basis  I have been surprised by how poor the global economic numbers have been lately 
And remember  earlier this month the global media were convinced that the U S  and China were about to finalize a trade deal  Now that negotiations have completely broken down  we should expect that these numbers will soon get even worse 
The following are 15 numbers that show how the global economy is currently performing 
 1 Global exports are absolutely crashing and have now fallen to the lowest level since 2009 
 2 U S  auto dealers are dealing with a backlog of 4 2 million unsold vehicles 
 3 Auto sales in Europe have fallen for seven months in a row 
 4 Chinese auto sales fell a whopping 16 6 percent in the month of April 
 5 Overall  Chinese auto sales have now fallen for 11 months in a row  That is a new all time record 
 6 U S  auto loan delinquencies have reached the highest level since the last recession 
 7 U S  credit card delinquencies have hit the highest level in eight years 
 8 In April  U S  manufacturing activity unexpectedly declined 0 5 percent 
 9 Thanks to the trade war  the price of soybeans just dropped to the lowest level since 2008 
 10 Party City just announced that it will be closing 45 stores 
 11 Fred s just announced that they will be closing 104 more stores 
 12 In April  U S  retail sales declined for the second time in three months 
 13 According to the Atlanta Fed s latest forecast  U S  GDP growth is expected to fall to just 1 2 percent in the second quarter of 2019 
 14 According to a new study just released by the Urban Institute  40 percent of all Americans  sometimes struggle to afford housing  utilities  food or health care  
 15 Overall  59 percent of all Americans are currently living paycheck to paycheck according to a survey that was just conducted by Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  
Leaders from both the U S  and China are trying to act tough and say the right things  but everyone knows that this trade war is going to hurt both countries 
Economic numbers from both nations have been troubling lately  and one expert that was just interviewed by CNBC says that  it could get a lot worse  

Consumer and industrial activity in both the U S  and China slowed in April  even before the world s two biggest economies entered the latest phase of an escalating trade war that could take a bite out of global growth 
 The real message today is that both the economic data from the U S  and China have disappointed  They re like two boys in the sandbox that are spitting on each other  and it could get a lot worse   said Marc Chandler  global market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex 

In the short term  it would greatly help if the U S  and China could find a way to agree to a trade deal 
Unfortunately  the events of the past 48 hours have made that a lot less likely 
As I discussed yesterday  President Trump essentially took a sledgehammer to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei  When the Commerce Department put Huawei on the  Entity List   it essentially banned the company from buying much needed parts and components from U S  firms  Some have described this as  the nuclear option   and I think that description is quite accurate  In the end  this move is going to be absolutely devastating for Huawei 
Of course the Chinese are absolutely furious about this  Huawei is viewed with great national pride in China  and this move is considered to be a direct insult to Chinese national honor  Most Americans are not paying too much attention to the details of the trade war  but in China this is a really big deal and people are extremely angry  In fact  there has apparently been a run on  Donald Trump toilet brushes  in China in recent days because the Chinese are so angry 
Following my recent article about Huawei  a number of readers complained that I was being too soft on China  Of course that is not true at all  Long before Donald Trump ran for president  I was writing about how China was lying  cheating  stealing our technology and robbing us blind  I was literally begging for our politicians to stand up and do something  and I was thrilled when Trump started talking tough about China because I knew that he really understood these issues 
But I also want everyone to understand that trying to decouple from the Chinese economy would be extremely painful even in the most optimistic scenario  Our two economies have become extremely integrated  and we have become very dependent on China in many different ways  They buy our soybeans  they provide us with rare earth elements  and they own more than a trillion dollars of our debt  Looking at it from the Chinese perspective  they have countless ways that they can hurt us  and the angrier we make them the more likely it will be that they will lash out at us 
When negotiating with China  you need to be tough but you also need a lot of finesse  Taking a baseball bat and slamming it into their kneecaps is not going to work 
If we destroy our relationship with China  that is going to result in us going down a very dark path  Yes  China is an evil empire that has no respect for human rights at all  There is no freedom of speech in China  over the past year they have been shutting down lots of churches and burning lots of Bibles  and they have been systematically throwing members of other religious minorities into concentration camps 
So I don t have any sympathy for the communist Chinese government at all  I just want all of you to understand that they are a very dangerous adversary  and a protracted trade war could be truly disastrous for the entire global economy ",2019-05-17,Michael T.

195178,416694,SCHW,Emerging Markets Ripe to Rally in 2019 as Trade Truce on Horizon,news," Bloomberg     Emerging market assets are poised to rally next year as protectionism between the U S  and China eases  according to some of the world s largest money managers 
The trade breakthrough reached Sunday by the U S   Canada and Mexico is helping generate optimism about a truce between the world s two largest economies next year as tariffs take their toll on both countries  That could spell relief for assets from Argentina to Turkey and Brazil that have been battered by the escalating feud between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping 
The deescalation with China may come in the middle of 2019  according to Mohammed Apabhai  the head of Asia trading strategy at  Citigroup   NYSE C  Global Markets in Hong Kong  By then  the Trump administration will have maxed out tariffs on more than  500 billion in Chinese goods and retaliatory measures by Beijing could start to hurt the U S  economy and stocks  Neither country wants that  so they could be pressured to make a deal  he said 
Any good news on trade means  emerging markets will bounce quite hard   Apabhai said 
Tensions between Washington and Beijing flared last week after the Trump administration s 10 percent tariff on about  200 billion of Chinese goods took effect  Xi s government responded with duties of its own on  60 billion in U S  products  adding to concern that there will be no near term resolution for the trade war  In fact  the Chinese have said they prefer to delay talks until the U S  midterms conclude in November  putting greater stakes on a potential Trump Xi meeting at the G 20 summit in Argentina later that month 
While talks between the two sides figure to be more contentious than those with North American negotiators  the new Nafta pact shows it s possible for the Trump administration to resolve disputes even amid sour personal relations 
 The breakthrough with Canada will put fresh pressure on China  which is facing a clear weakening of its manufacturing sector   said Stephen Dover  the head of equities at Franklin Templeton in San Mateo  California   I think the U S  and China will be back at the negotiating table later this fall  with signs of progress on market access for key American sectors such as financial services  
 Economic High 
U S  economic expansion will slow to 2 5 percent next year from 2 9 percent in 2018  according to the median forecast of more than 60 economists surveyed by Bloomberg  while China s will decelerate to 6 3 percent from 6 6 percent 
The dent on growth in both economies as well as pressure from consumers and business groups could hasten a trade deal  according to Teresa Kong  the head of fixed income at Matthews Asia in San Francisco  Almost 69 percent of U S  businesses operating in China oppose using tariffs as a weapon  while just 8 5 percent support them  a survey of 434 respondents in April and May by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai showed 
 When the repercussions start to take a toll on the economy  Trump might consider pulling back   said Kong  adding that a decline in the S P 500 Index would probably be the leading indicator 
That s similar to the view of Chen Wenling  the chief economist at Beijing based China Center for International Economic Exchanges  a think tank led by retired senior officials 
 The trade war can t last long given the impact on U S  consumers   she said   The U S  is riding an economic high given the positive impact from the tax cut and the stock market rally  but it s a distorted view  
Trump will also be gearing up for his 2020 reelection race and the prospect of a deal that could be branded as a win for the U S  business community may be too tantalizing to pass up  according to analysts and investors 
Rally Time
That would be welcome news for emerging market fund managers  who ve watched stocks slump into a bear market and currencies from Argentina to Turkey to India slide to record lows this year on the backdrop of a strong dollar  rising U S  interest rates and escalating trade disputes 
 Any indication that the U S  and China are resolving trade differences would likely be good for EM assets   Asian stocks in particular  said Kathy Jones  the chief fixed income strategist at  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  in New York 
High yield emerging market debt would likely get a boost from easing trade tensions after this year s underperformance  according to Shamaila Khan  the director of emerging market debt at AllianceBernstein in New York 
That said  the general consensus in Washington and Beijing is that trade will remain a key cog in their long term strategic rivalry  so a truce may not last 
 It s plausible that an agreement can be reached some time next year on a narrow set of issues   said Isabelle Mateos y Lago  the chief multi asset strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute  the asset manager s think tank in New York  The outlook for emerging markets will depend on the growth momentum in the U S   Europe and China  she said   As long as these regions keep growing at a healthy clip  EM should be fine  ",2018-10-01,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/emerging-markets-ripe-to-rally-in-2019-as-trade-truce-on-horizon-1630972,1630972

195203,416719,SCHW,Weekly S P 500 Charts  Short Term Outlook Features Downside Risk,opinion,"1  S P 500 Levels and Checks
First up is a check in on the market  Despite a very dovish pivot by the Fed  the market sold off late in the week  but still managed to close just above that fabled 2800 level  Fans of moving averages will also notice something interesting in this chart  aside from the 200 DMA commencing a slight upwards slope  
The 50 day moving average is getting ever closer to breaking above the 200 day moving average  also known as a  gold cross    a very slow moving signal which is designed to tell whether a market is in an uptrend or downtrend  By its nature it shows up late  and many dismiss the indicator  but it is still something to keep an eye out for 
Bottom line  The S P 500 managed to only just hold the 2800 level 

2  S P 500 Bearish Breadth Divergence
This chart showed up last week too  but I also highlight how the short term bearish breadth divergence signal currently playing out almost seems to echo the larger bearish breadth divergence pattern which preceded the correction late last year 
Early signs are that this short term bearish breadth divergence  higher highs on price vs lower highs on the indicator  is resolving to the downside  and it lines up with a few other tactical short term indicators  e g  put call  VIX  etc  which likewise seem to point to more water going under the bridge short term as some post Fed indigestion seems to promulgate 
Bottom line  Short term bearish breadth divergence looks to be resolving to the downside 

3  Fed Announcements vs the Market
Another short term chart  this one by Martin Enlund of Nordea Markets  showing an interesting side by side comparison of trading action around the announcement of QE2 vs the announcement to cease taper QT1  quantitative tightening part 1  
In my opinion  ending quantitative tightening would be an easing measure  From a flows standpoint  it means more purchases of treasuries   particularly given the twist  ABS to treasuries  
Bottom line  When the Fed announced QE2 markets likewise experience indigestion before heading higher  the same could end up true for ceasing QT1 

4  The  Sweet Spot  Indicator
This is one of my own wacky indicators  I call it the Fed Sweet Spot Indicator  This indicator simply subtracts the Fed funds rate from the Atlanta Fed wage growth tracker  the higher the reading the more supportive it is for stocks  and vice versa 
The logic is that higher readings reflect both the stimulus effect from lower  relative  rates and in so far as higher readings reflect higher wage growth also imply a confidence flows effect  The key point is this indicator has been steadily falling  both as a result of higher interest rates and wavering wage growth in recent months  
Bottom line  The Fed Sweet Spot Indicator is steadily leaving  left   the sweet spot   

5  Labor Cost Mentions
This unique chart shows the number of mentions of  Labor Cost  in quarterly earnings calls by S P 500 companies  Interestingly there has been a steady rise over the past couple years as the US labor market has really tightened up  The downside of this is the possibility it also implicitly reflects profit margin pressures 
Bottom line  S P 500 companies seem to be more concerned about wage pressures lately 

6  Yield Curve vs Stockmarket
This rather timely chart from Jeffrey Kleintop of Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  shows the US Treasury yield curve  in this case the 10 year minus 3 month yield  against the MSCI World  global stocks   It also shows recessions shaded in grey 
The key takeaway from this chart  also     by the way  in case you missed it      the US yield curve under the above definition inverted last week  is that almost always  the exception being example no  2  a US yield curve inversion occurs within some proximity of a major market top 
Bottom line  The yield curve may be signaling a major market top is near 

7  US Bond Yield vs Manufacturing PMIs
Speaking of bond yields  here s another of my own charts and this one is telling us we may need to get used to an inverted curve and indeed lower yields at the long end  This chart shows the composite manufacturing PMI for developed markets  with the latest data point being from the just released March flash PMI results  against the US 10 year yield 
There s every possibility that the relationship between these two series breaks down or that the current reading is the worst to come to this mini cycle  but in the short term  it s probably best not to fight it  although my view   bonds are still expensive  
Bottom line  US 10 year treasury bond yields may be headed even lower 

8  Buyback Blackouts
This useful chart maps out the progression of the buyback blackouts across earnings reporting season  Basically there is a wall of blackouts that will prevent corporate buyback flow  and this will create a vulnerable period for the market  particularly given some of the other short term issues ruminating their way through the market right now   Late April May fares much better though  something to remember should the sell off worsen  
Bottom line  Buyback black outs will remove a flows tailwind from the market in the coming weeks 

9  US Stockmarket Leverage
This chart shows an aggregated view of the quantum of leveraged stock market bets  The figure now totals just over  250B  down from about  400B at the peak   So there has been some de leveraging  yet both in absolute terms and as a   of market cap leveraged bets are still sizable indeed 
I often think of this indicator similar to how you think of valuations   it s not exactly a timing indicator  but just as when valuations are high  risk is high    when leveraged bets are high  risk is likewise high  And  well  leveraged bets are still high 
Bottom line  After some deleveraging  leveraged stockmarket bets remain historically high 

10  Commodities vs Stocks
Final chart of this week s S P500 ChartStorm takes a long term look at commodities vs stocks  A similar chart has been doing the rounds  GSCI total return index vs the S P 500 index   and many have used it to argue a bullish case for commodities  often times it s with specific reference to gold  
In the long run  theoretically  stocks should outperform commodities  Stocks enjoy growth in earnings and dividend income  yet commodities are more a product of  sometimes multi decade  demand supply cycles  This cyclicality aspect does appear to play out in the chart below  but as a timing indicator it comes up wanting  similar to longer term views of valuation for stocks  
Still  I must admit I am intrigued by this chart  particularly given the extreme low reading  and my bullish bias on commodities more recently as a few things are falling into place there  
Bottom line  Commodities are trading at about a 50 year low vs stocks 

Key takeaways on the outlook
Though arguably the dovish pivot by the Fed is a new piece of bullish information for the market  and the holding of the 2800 level is a good sign  it may not be enough to offset concerns about the economic outlook as the yield curve inverts  With bearish breadth divergence playing through  the QE2 analog  and buyback blackouts in mind  the short term outlook features downside risk  With all the hallmarks of a late cycle regime  the late cycle lamentations are set to continue ",2019-03-25,Callum Thomas,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weekly-sp500-chartstorm--24-march-2019-200400538,200400538
195204,416720,SCHW,Schwab  SCHW  To Report Q1 Results  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Schwab  SCHW  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 67 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21 8  
Revenues are expected to be  2 70 billion  up 12 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 24  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schwab 
For Schwab  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 49  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Schwab will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Schwab would post earnings of  0 64 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 65  delivering a surprise of  1 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Schwab doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schwab-schw-to-report-q1-results-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200404785,200404785

195207,416723,SCHW,Dollar Bulls Get Fresh Ammo From Draghi Powell Double Whammy,news," Bloomberg     Currency traders looking to Jerome Powell and Mario Draghi for direction are getting the clearest signals yet that the dollar is set to extend its gains versus the euro 
That bet is being fueled by a divergence between the Federal Reserve chairman s hawkish stance Wednesday and the European Central Bank president s dovish posture Thursday  The disparate policy paths and contrasting fundamental trends in the U S  and Europe are setting up a test of the key  1 15 level for the euro dollar exchange rate in the weeks ahead  according to strategists at  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW    Co  and ABN Amro Group NV 
The greenback has  a little room to run  still  said Kathy Jones  New York based chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab   We have seen softer numbers out of Europe and firmer numbers out of the U S  
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose as much as 0 7 percent Thursday to its highest since November after the ECB pledged to keep interest rates unchanged at current record lows at least through the summer of 2019  even as it phases out bond purchases by the end of the year  The move comes a day after the Fed raised interest rates  ratcheted up rate projections for 2018 and 2019 and sounded an optimistic note on the U S  economy  The greenback has risen 2 percent this year  rebounding after an almost 9 percent loss in 2017 
Here s what others had to say about the euro dollar outlook 

 We expect EUR USD to decline towards  1 10 in September 2018 because of long euro liquidation and a continuation of positive economic developments in the U S   said Georgette Boele  a currency strategist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam   The investment community is still long euros so some of them are closing their positions 
The ECB s date based  dovish guidance is  a material negative development for the euro   George Saravelos  global co head of FX research at  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn   wrote in a note

The bank s conviction that the lower end of EUR USD s 1 15 1 20 range will hold  has now been materially reduced 


For Alessio de Longis  a money manager in OppenheimerFunds Inc  s global multi asset group   the rate guidance was definitely a surprise    I don t recall the ECB ever giving calendar based guidance

 Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  in Austin  Texas  The things that have caused this market to not be happy at the beginning of the day have not abated at all  As a result there is no reason to think it won t weaken into the close   The 50 day  moving average  was providing a little bit of support right at the get go and then the 100 day sort of looked like it was the stop but if I am a technical guy I am worried about the 200 day now  which is frankly  a ways down there  That is 2 6664  that is not a number I want to get anywhere near  But if you look back at the pullbacks we had in early April and early May both of them didn t really bounce until they hit the 200 day  so I would be a little cautious here    This is an incredibly tough market to not only forecast but also to trade because fundamentals are really strong everywhere   corporate earnings are great  labor market is great  everything is great   but you can t trade technicals when everything is going on is being driven by news and geopolitical tensions  So how do you predict the next hour or next day what might come out of Washington  I just don t know how you trade this thing  I don t know how you forecast it  because you don t know  It is a tough one  I can only forecast based on fundamentals and technicals  I can t predict the news    As long as this stuff is out there and until we see somebody backpedaling  we see somebody flinch  we see some progress in negotiations which we all think is part of the game  we haven t see any of that  I would be cautious here  I don t like it  I hate to think this kind of stuff could derail all of the fundamental strength we have but in the near term  it looks like it    WAYNE KAUFMAN  CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT PHOENIX FINANCIAL SERVICES IN NEW YORK    People are scared  the market does not like uncertainty  And a trade war is something that is difficult  if not impossible  to handicap  A lot of profit taking on stocks that had been leaders  Selling in the cyclical

JANKOVSKIS  CO CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER  OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC  LISLE  ILLINOIS    The story out there today is about trade tensions with China  the latest development with regard to limiting investment in U S  firms  We re seeing some areas holding up reasonably well  telecom  utilities and consumer staples  Industrials and technology stocks  with their extended valuations  are the sectors that are struggling today    Future market performance  depends a lot on the statements we hear from the respective parties  I don t expect a rebound  but I don t expect the pace of selling we re seeing today to continue either   ANDREW FRANKEL  CO PRESIDENT OF STUART FRANKEL   CO IN NEW YORK    It was a technical level the S P broke  the 100 day moving average   When we broke that it sold off and now you re seeing it hovering around that level    Amidst a day the volume isn t robust  technical levels can play a key role     That added a little fuel to the move lower  Overall from a trading perspective you see a self fulfilling prophesy  The lower the tape goes  people will rein in exposure  Sometimes selling begets selling  There s a backdrop of trade concerns    We re due for some sort of pullback  You ve multiple sectors getting hurt  It makes me feel you ve got exposure being taken down   J  BRYANT EVANS  INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER  COZAD ASSET MANAGEMENT

going to shake out  For sure  we are looking at negative issues for U S  agriculture products  for steel and other basic materials  especially aluminum  and also how all of the tit for tat shakes out

DIRECTOR OF TRADING  PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS  CHICAGO  The market is perceiving that politics will become policy  The market is starting to price in that the tariffs will start to become real  The rhetoric is getting stronger rather than weaker  We ll keep trading off if the trend persists    A trade war means lower global GDP  It s bad for growth  What we ve seen in the last nine days was a measured sell off  We re still barely positive for the year    The rhetoric is foreboding  It s not sounding better and the deadline is getting closer     There s going to be a measured

OFFICER  NORTH STAR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT  CHICAGO  It s now all about the whole trade dialogue  which seems to be going in the wrong direction  Most market participants and most companies would

currently  not only with the Chinese  who I think are the primary target of all this trade talk  but even with our friends  is unsettling    The market in general has hung in there really well with the belief that this is a negotiating strategy  that these things aren t actually going to happen    It s seeming like it is  It s beginning to seem like these positions that are extreme and punitive are actually not just a negotiating strategy  it looks like they might be reality  And if they re reality  then it causes all kinds of disruption to global business endeavors  Pretty much every

195221,416737,SCHW,Deal making spike seen as positive sign for U S  stock market  for now,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors are optimistic that a pickup in corporate acquisitions stands to support the volatile U S  stock market  and does not represent a worrisome cyclical sign  Global mergers and acquisitions have had their strongest start to a year ever  according to data from Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence  The  1 23 trillion in first quarter global deal making came in just shy of the  1 31 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2015  which on a quarterly basis marked a multi year high   However  heightened deal making could be an ominous signal  if it suggests companies are desperate to find growth as the economic expansion winds down  or if it indicates a euphoria echoed among stock investors  For example  global M A on a quarterly basis hit multi year peaks in 2000 and in 2007  preceding sustained stock market declines   But market watchers told Reuters they see other reasons for the latest rise in mergers and acquisitions   including incentives from U S  tax reform and the desire to take advantage of still relatively low interest rates   and instead view the M A pop as positive for stocks   It s a sign we re late in the cycle and it eventually gets worrisome   said Jeffrey Kleintop  chief global investment strategist at  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  in Boston   But in the near term it s probably a plus in that you get deal premiums and more money employed in taking equity out   For an interactive graphic on global deal making  click   At a time when some on Wall Street worry stocks are trading at expensive valuation levels  investors said the willingness by companies to make purchases is encouraging   To the extent you can get cash deals done  it provides a lot of support for the market   said Rick Meckler  president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City  New Jersey   It takes out equities  where holders are likely to reinvest in other stocks  and helps re establish that the prices that stocks are trading at are not too high   Global quarterly deal making hit a record  1 42 trillion in the second quarter of 2007  Several months later the S P 500 began a decline that eventually cut the benchmark index by more than half as the U S  economy sank into one of the worst recessions in decades  King Lip  chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco  recalls that 2007 M A spree as fueled by debt  and at the time  there were other signs the economic expansion cycle was ending  as opposed to now   I just think we are not at that point in the cycle   Lip said   I still think we are mid cycle in terms of this recovery   Indeed  investors point to overall strength in the economy  including S P 500 profits expected to rise about 20 percent this year  Another factor that separates the current climate is the recently enacted U S  tax law  which cuts the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and includes a tax break for multi national companies to bring back profits stored overseas   I just view this increase in M A more so related to the increased levels of cash that tax reform is producing   said Lindsey Bell  investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York  While the spike in deal making can indicate too much euphoria in the market  the lack of other indicators also pointing toward over confidence suggests M A could be an outlier in this respect  says Stephen Massocca  managing director at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco

Three days after the implosion of an exchange traded note betting on low volatility  Fidelity Investments said it had moved to protect investors from these products 
The fund giant is halting customer purchases of three volatility focused exchange traded funds  Robert Beauregard  a company spokesman  said in an email  They are  ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  SVXY   VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN  XIV   and the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Medium Term ETN  ZIV  
The ban started Feb  6  Beauregard said  The firm didn t issue the news publicly until Friday   We are allowing customers to sell out of existing positions   he said 
Representatives for TD Ameritrade Holding Corp  and  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  Corp  said Friday that customers can still trade SVXY  Ameritrade  however  is holding a 100 percent margin requirement for those purchases  spokeswoman Kim Hillyer said 
Brokerage firms including E Trade have moved to protect customers as global markets have plunged and volatility has surged  The fallout from the implosion of a vast array of arcane bets against stock market volatility mounted this week   Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  Group AG moved to liquidate one investment product and more than a dozen others were halted after their values sunk toward zero 
SVXY is down 91 percent since last Friday  XIV plunged 96 percent and ZIV fell 27 percent

195237,416753,SCHW,Q4  18 S P 500 Earnings Begin This Week,opinion,"At least 22 large cap Financials report this coming week and for client s  JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  and Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  are the most important 
These positions aren t really traded and have been core holdings for years  and even though the Financial sector looks technically dubious  and didn t really get the bounce expected with the latest 10  S P 500 rally to start 2019  the plan is to keep the core holdings intact 
The Financial sector had a tough 2018 returning  13   and all of it coming in the 4th quarter  2018  but Financial s are expected to grow EPS 9    10  in 2019  still ahead of the S P 500 
It s hard to sell the sector after 2008   2009  nothing will ever be as bad for Financials as we saw in 2007   2009 
Here is the S P 500 data by the numbers  
Fwd 4 tr est   172 15 vs  173 54
PE ratio  15x
PEG ratio  2 47x
S P 500 earnings yield  6 63  vs last week s 6 85 
Y o y growth of the fwd est  6 1  vs last week s 6 7 
Source  I B E S for Refinitiv
Summary   Conclusion  If 2019 S P 500 estimates have made a low in terms of expected growth for the coming year  with the Street expecting just 6 1  as of this week  then readers should know it shortly  and certainly by the end of the coming week  with Financial s still being 13  of the market cap weight of the S P 500 
Ex tax reform  per Factset  the S P 500 earnings growth for 2018  was or will be 14    15   once we get all the Q4  18 earnings data 
Expectations for 2019 are pretty subdued already  and that is always a plus 
I couldnt find the chart or the rationale  but Bespoke noted this week that typically when analyst s get this conservative about quarterly earnings  it bodes well for the pending results  which in this case would be the 4th quarter s numbers 
Take this along with all forecasts and opinions with a substantial dose of pessimism  but I think 2019 S P 500 earnings will steadily get stronger through the year as the Fed  China  the shutdown and then Brexit get resolved  and will end up 2019 better than 10   maybe even low teens 
Too much negative sentiment right now ",2019-01-12,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/q4-18-sp-500-earnings-begin-this-week-200374968,200374968

195252,416768,SCHW,Why Schwab  SCHW  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Schwab  SCHW   which belongs to the Zacks Financial   Investment Bank industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This financial services firm has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 51  
For the last reported quarter  Schwab came out with earnings of  0 65 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 64 per share  representing a surprise of 1 56   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 58 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 60 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 45  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Schwab  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Schwab has an Earnings ESP of  0 59  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 16  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-schwab-schw-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200374077,200374077
195253,416769,SCHW,Schwab  SCHW  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Schwab  SCHW  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 16  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 64 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  45 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 66 billion  up 18 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 98  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schwab 
For Schwab  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 59  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Schwab will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Schwab would post earnings of  0 64 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 65  delivering a surprise of  1 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Schwab appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schwab-schw-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200374056,200374056

195264,416780,SCHW,Why Planning Early For Retirement Is More Important Than You Think,opinion, Save early  save often  is one of the most important retirement lessons  even more so for millennials  With crushing student loan debt  increasing living costs and stagnant salaries  many millennials are living paycheck to paycheck and barely being able to save at all Additionally  data collected by Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  reveals that millennials who are able to put money aside are saving more for short term life experiences instead of making more long term investments like buying a home or investing in the market  Another 2018 survey on 1 000 millennials by LendEdu shows that about half of them spent more on eating out than saving for retirement Retirement is an especially important area that younger generations tend to overlook  but it s a reality that we all face as we get older  Planning early and saving amply for one s retirement is like borrowing money from one s younger self  So  the earlier one starts to save for retirement  the lesser their premium burden is Let s Talk NumbersLet us consider two individuals   one with 10 years until retirement and the other with 30  Assuming that both maintain the same standard of living  an amount of  5 000 000 is required to sustain the post retirement period Excluding any interest or inflation rates to make understanding simpler  the older person will have to save  500 000 a year  or about  41 667 a month from now for 10 years  On the other hand  the younger individual will have to save only about  13 889 a month to reach that retirement goal The Power of Compounding  Better Early Than LateSimply put  compounding is generating earnings from previous earnings  Retirement savings invested appropriately for a longer period of time will give you a bigger return by the time you retire compared to savings invested for a short period of time Interest then gets added to the principle amount at the end of the twelfth month  Then  this increased amount of principle gets reinvested to earn a higher amount of interest  even at the same rate of interest  So  if more years are added to the savings plan  the returns at the end of the term are also higher Compound interest is possibly the best incentive to save for retirement  As Albert Einstein famously said   Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world  He who understands it  earns it  He who doesn t  pays it  How Can Beginners Save To encourage millennials and young adults to save  initiatives like the American Savings Promotion Act  under which banks reward those who saved the most money  have been undertaken by the government  Saving for retirement  however  requires specific plans in which you can invest for a better future  Here are a couple of options that you can consider to plan your retirement savings A 401 k  is an employer sponsored fund in which you can contribute a certain percentage of your pre tax salary  In some cases  the employer will pitch in a certain percentage of the amount you put in  called 401 k  match You can also choose to put your money into an Individual Retirement Account  IRA   which is a plan that enables you to save for retirement in a tax advantaged way  A traditional IRA accepts pre tax contributions  whereas Roth IRAs do not provide tax deductions on contributions  That is  a Roth IRA takes after tax contributions only  and savings and investments grow tax free without any restriction on withdrawals  In traditional IRA plans  income tax is not imposed on the yearly contribution  up to the annual maximum  and post maturity  all withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income Those who have access to these retirement benefits tend to save more than expected  A recent analysis by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies shows that millennials who invested in 401 k s  IRAs  and other kids of retirement funds put aside 10  of their salary on average There are very few things that a millennial cannot do  and there are very few things that the Internet cannot provide  However  if you re unable to access one of these plans through your employer or workplace   according to Pew Charitable Trusts research  over 67  of millennials do not  there are websites and other online options available that offer secure plans A Simple Way to Build WealthNo matter what your financial goals are  investing in quality stocks is an option worth considering  Stocks have produced better returns than other kinds of investments over the years and generated significant wealth for shareholders  If you re interested in stocks but you re nervous about picking the right ones  Zacks can help  Our research team makes it simple to find long term buys with long term wealth building

195267,416783,SCHW,Digital lender SoFi starts U S  online wealth management service,news,"By Anna Irrera
NEW YORK  Reuters    Social Finance Inc  the online lender known as SoFi  said on Tuesday it had launched its first digital wealth management platform  as the company continues to branch out beyond its core student lending business 
Like startups known as  robo advisors   SoFi Wealth will allow U S  clients to invest as little as  500 in automated portfolios made up of low cost exchange traded funds  the company said 
Unlike the purely digital model championed by some startups  SoFi Wealth clients will also have unlimited access to human advisors  via phone or chat 
SoFi  one of the largest online lenders in the United States  started out as a company that refinances student loans  Trying to retain clients as their financial needs evolve  it has begun expanding into mortgages  It also acquired mobile bank Zenbanx 
As it targets younger consumers  it also uses novel marketing tactics such as offering career coaching or organizing meet ups for its clients  which it calls  members  
The launch of its new wealth management platform comes as the investment management industry has been trying to strike a balance between the use of digital and the traditional in person financial advice 
In January Betterment LLC  one of the earliest and largest robo advisor startups  significantly shifted its strategy by announcing it would launch new services allowing clients to receive financial advice from human advisers  Broker  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  Corp launched a similar hybrid service in March 
 For those who haven t started investing  like younger professionals who make up a large part of the SoFi member base  that guidance from a live advisor can help give them the confidence they need to start planning for a lifetime of financial success   said John Gardner  general manager at SoFi Wealth 
The company said it was also developing financial planning services  and expects to launch them this summer  These include joint financial planning for couples and first time home buying 
Competition has been mounting in digital wealth management  raising concerns about prospects of independent startups to grow enough to become profitable 
SoFi will not charge management fees on the new wealth management services to its loan borrowers over the life of their loan  while it will charge everyone else a fee of 0 25 percent of assets under management annually  The fee will be waived for the first  10 000 invested ",2017-05-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/digital-lender-sofi-starts-u.s.-online-wealth-management-service-484899,484899

195275,416791,SCHW,Delta Airlines Vs  American Airlines  Which Is A Better Buy ,opinion,"Airlines experienced a resurgence in recent years as investors flocked to these once hated stocks  After the September 11th  2001 attacks the ARCA Airline dropped from  180 to  120  It barely peaked above  60 before tanking to  15 with the rest of the market in 2009  Since then the index increased 8x through 2017 
Delta Airlines  NYSE  NYSE DAL  exited bankruptcy in 2007  Shares dropped from an open at  19 10 per share down below  4 a share in 2009  Yet  the stock took off to over  60 a share through 2017  Their current share prices reflect modest growth but a low P E and good value 
American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL  saw a high of  62 a share in 2007 to crash down below  2 a share in 2009  Yet  in 2018 the stock hit a high of  58 a share  29x it s low  With a rock bottom P E of 6 06x and a great PEG ratio  why wouldn t you want to own AAL 
Looking at Delta Airlines vs  American Airlines across a handful of metrics  it becomes apparent that American Airlines is a value trap 
Valuation  American AirlinesAmerican Airlines and Delta Airlines both present a good value  Neither trades above the single digits in terms of price to earnings  Both trade in line on a forward P E basis compared to their current P E  Across all the valuation metrics DAL trades at a higher multiple than AAL 
Delta s higher growth rate gives it higher multiples in every category  However  comparing the price to earnings growth  American Airlines still appears to be the cheaper alternative  With AAL prices depressed on valuation  any turn in growth provides the stock price a quick boost 
 Source  Schwab
Growth  Delta AirlinesDelta Airlines presented much better earnings and growth in recent years  Compared to American Airlines  Delta put up 8 85  growth vs  American s 5 05  growth  The 5 year growth would appear to paint a different picture  However  AAL merged with US Airways to effectively double sales  Their growth remained subpar when considering this acquisition  DAL not only keeps acquiring more business travelers but manages to do so with a better margin  Their growth in earnings remains substantial and is expected to continue  American Airlines is expected to continue to suffer from higher fuel prices 
 Source  Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW 
Profitability  Delta AirlinesAt first glance  American Airlines shows a higher gross margin  Yet  they quickly fall short once you get down to the operating margin  Both companies continue to suffer from higher fuel costs as they deal with the rise in oil over  70 per barrel  Neither hedges their fuel costs which means that they take the full brunt of the effect when oil trades higher and the benefits when it trades lower 
However  the difference lies in how they manage their business  DAL continues to maintain its overheads and operations more effectively than AAL  Comparatively  they drive nearly 50  more sales per employee than AAL  That says something  given the positive survey results DAL still achieves 
In fact  American Airlines  operating margin declined from a higher of 17 6  in 2015 to a low of 8 8  TTM  Compare that to Delta Airlines  who went from 17 5  to 12 4   The evidence grows that better fuel management strategies favor DAL

Efficiency  Delta AirlinesDelta Airlines continues to bring in business clients  They ve led in most consumer surveys and done a good job keeping costs down  Compared to AAL  DAL performs better on returns on assets and investments  Return on equity has remained skewed due to AAL s negative shareholder equity 
 Source  Charles Schwab
Financial Strength  Delta AirlinesA quick look at the financial health of these airlines shows both on about equal footing  Yet  one major issue exists for American Airlines  Right now it shows negative shareholder equity  While it s not something they are unaccustomed to  Delta Airlines doesn t have that problem  Negative shareholder equity signals problems to any investors 
Shareholder equity equals total assets minus liabilities  While operating cash flow comes in at  3 69 billion  free cash flow comes in at   819 million  Capital intensive industries can have these problems at times  Given DAL offers a nice equity line  why bother with AAL  With their current trends  they look more like a company headed for bankruptcy than a stock pick

Overall Winner  Delta AirlinesAirlines operated in a boom and bust environment  What separates the winners from the losers is operating efficiency and value  Delta Airlines continues to promote the business traveler experience and maintain an efficient operation around its fleets  Oil prices hurt both airlines equally as neither hedge these costs  Yet  American Airlines barely keeps itself afloat 
AAL s declining and now negative shareholder equity should scare investors  The economic environment remains strong  and though fuel prices have climbed  the company operated in a soft environment for several years  The failure in these conditions would suggest the company needs a management and strategy change ",2018-10-16,Sayat Kartabayev,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delta-airlines-vs-american-airlines-which-is-a-better-buy-200348580,200348580

195287,416803,SCHW,Potential For A Stronger Second Half In Stocks,opinion,"Seems as though much has taken place in the first five months of this year that is newsworthy and impactful to the markets  i e  Iran  North Korea  tariffs  an increasing 10 year yield  and I could go on  With the volume of news flow though  the equity market has essentially traded sideways this year with the S P 500 Index price return equaling just 1 78    
It seems with an equity market that has been pretty boring  some have focused on other issues  with one being a flattening yield curve  In the below chart  and I could go back further in time but suffice it to say that an inverted yield curve is not a positive signal  i e   it is a recession predictor  As the below chart shows though  as the curve goes through the flattening process  stocks have been exceptionally strong performers  Recently though stocks have not been rewarded in spite of the continued flattening of the yield curve so far this year  Is the equity market spring being coiled   Having noted the positive influence a flattening curve has on stocks  investors do not want to see the curve invert  In that regard there are two important economic events occurring that place upward pressure on the 10 year Treasury yield  First  inflation pressure is on the rise  The maroon line in the below chart shows the consumer price index  CPI or inflation  above the Fed s 2  target  i e   rising at a 2 5  annual rate  The consumer segment accounts for approximately 70  of economic activity and if the consumer earns more in wages  they are likely to spend it  thus  having a positive influence on economic growth  In the same chart below  the blue line is the unemployment rate and it is at an extremely low 3 9   This is an indication of a tight labor market and historically  this low level of unemployment has lead to higher inflation   
 Secondly  the maroon line in the chart below shows a steady trend higher in the growth of average hourly earnings since 2013  The growth rate in wages is now running near the same level as inflation  i e   2 5   Also notable on the chart below is the blue line that represents the percentage of small business firms  NFIB Survey  planning to raise compensation  In 2010 the percentage of firms indicating they were increasing compensation was essentially zero percent and today it is over 20   Increasing growth in labor cost is fairly certain as one looks ahead  all else being equal   
In short  a tight labor market and upward growth in compensation are likely to translate into higher inflation  Higher inflation then places upward pressure on longer term interest rates  i e   the 10 year Treasury  At a minimum a higher level of inflation may result in longer rates keeping pace with the Fed s push to move short term rates higher and thus keep the yield curve from inverting 
 Finally  earnings growth for companies is an important variable in the growth of a company s stock price  As the below table shows  and with 96  of S P 500 firms reporting Q1 2018 earnings  earnings growth in the quarter is a strong 26 3   
 Tax relief has been an important element in this increase  but as the below chart also shows  top line revenue growth is nearing a double digit growth rate as well  i e   Q1 revenue growth of 8 3   
The Q1 2018 earnings and sales results are certainly positive  however  these are past results  the market is more interested in forward earnings growth  To this end  the below table shows forward growth estimates out through the fourth quarter of 2019  The red highlighted quarter represents the one year forward growth estimates for sales  net income and earnings in Q1 2019  The earnings growth for Q1 2019 is 6 9   a significant slowing compared to Q1 2018 earnings growth of 26 3   This slowing in the growth rate of future estimated earnings is likely contributing to the sideways equity market action experienced by investors during the first five months of this year   
The rapid move higher in stock prices in January was likely the market s excitement about the tax cuts and the positive impact on the near term Q1 earnings  growth  rate  Realistic minds have prevailed and now the market is adjusting back to a more normal earnings growth rate environment  low double digits  hence the potential coiled spring market reference earlier 
I have noted in earlier blog articles  one here  the similarity of this bull market run to that of the 1950 s and 1980 s bull markets  If history rhymes  maybe the equity market is nearing a move higher  Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  recently published a report    that provides further commentary on the market and economic environment for the balance of the year that readers may find of interest as well ",2018-05-27,Blog of HORAN Capital Advisors,https://www.investing.com/analysis/potential-for-a-stronger-second-half-in-stocks-200319601,200319601

195290,416806,SCHW,Hong Kong police struggle to stop brokerage hacking spree,news,"By Michelle Price HONG KONG  Reuters    Hong Kong police are struggling to deal with digital pump and dump schemes targeting brokerages   a little known type of computer generated fraud that surged in the Chinese territory last year  Although the money involved was small   only about  20 million worth of shares   there were 81 such incidents reported in 2016  more than triple the number in 2015  according to police  In the scheme  criminals invest in thinly traded penny stocks and then manipulate their share prices by ordering trades from hacked brokerage accounts  They earn profits by selling before the fraudulent trades are reported   After last year s cyber heist of  81 million at Bangladesh s central bank and a series of hacks of ATM s around the world  authorities fear such pump and dump schemes could be increasingly used for electronic theft  Hong Kong is a favored place for such attacks because of the number of thinly traded penny stocks in the territory and because its securities industry has fallen behind other financial centers in defending against cyber fraud   At least seven brokers and eight banks have been targeted in Hong Kong  including  HSBC Holdings  Plc  LON HSBA  and Bank of China International  BOCI  Securities  according to regulators and people familiar with confidential investigations  A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment   A spokeswoman for BOCI Securities said he could not comment on its case but the brokerage would continue to invest in IT security    If you ask regulators in the industry what is the number one threat  not surprisingly it s all about cyber attacks   Ashley Alder  CEO of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission  SFC  and chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions  said in a speech to the local legislature last week   We ve seen that happen not only in banking but also at brokers in Hong Kong  in particular recent attacks to do with basically hijacking share trading accounts   Such schemes surfaced more than a decade ago in the United States   Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  Corp  E Trade Financial Corp and  JP Morgan Chase   NYSE JPM    Co  were identified as victims of these schemes in a 2006 complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission  The pace of attacks reported in the United States has slowed in recent years after big brokerages implemented a variety of strategies to thwart the hacks  said John Reed Stark  a former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission s  SEC  Office of Internet Enforcement   Some use algorithms to identify and halt unusual trading activity  others scrutinize Internet traffic for orders coming from suspicious servers and one stopped permitting customers to use its online trading platform from buying penny stocks  said Stark  who now runs cyber security consulting firm John Reed Stark Consulting LLC   But such protections are rare in Hong Kong  where the government has only recently started suggesting security improvements to banks and brokerages which have traditionally considered stock trading to be low risk  TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION The Hong Kong SFC last year told firms to increase surveillance of client transactions and data protection   Authorities believe that hackers accessed brokerage accounts using stolen or guessed passwords  according to investigators  This might have been thwarted if they were protected with two factor authentication  the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has said   Two factor authentication typically includes a password and a piece of information only the user has  for instance an electronic token with changing numbers    Hong Kong is being targeted because they have not instituted the same cyber protections that we see in the U S  and certain parts of Europe   said Jeff Cramer  a former U S  prosecutor  Cramer  who is managing director with cyber security investigations firm Berkeley Research Group  said he expects to see more attacks in Hong Kong and perhaps other Asian nations  including China  Japan and South Korea that are also behind in cyber security  FIGHTING BACK Such pump and dump cases have proven tough to crack in the United States because the masterminds are typically overseas  using surrogates and pseudonyms to make investments  Brokerages are typically not required to go public when they are hacked  so cases often only surface when the government files a complaint against suspected cyber criminals  or the hack results in litigation   The attack involving BOCI Securities year became public after it was sued by a customer that claimed its account was breached   Trading firm Fast Track Holdings Limited alleged in court documents that somebody hacked into its brokerage account on the afternoon of September 23 using a valid user ID and password  Within 18 minutes  the intruder had emptied the account by spending HK 38 million to buy 49 million shares of thinly traded Pa Shun Pharmaceutical  according to Fast Track   The stock soared more than 30 percent after the purchase  which was made at a 36 percent premium to the previous day s closing price  Reuters data shows  BOCI alerted Fast Track of the suspicious activity an hour later  but it has said in court documents it should not be held financially responsible  saying it found no evidence its systems had been compromised   Peter Pang  Pa Shun s CFO  told Reuters the management  would keep an eye to the incident and report to the regulators and the public when necessary    One person familiar with the case said Fast Track s management believes the incident was a pump and dump scam and that Pa Shun was targeted because it is thinly traded  but it remained unclear who was responsible

195298,416814,SCHW,Weekly S P 500 ChartStorm   8 Apr 2018,opinion,"Those that follow my personal account on  will be familiar with my weekly S P 500  ChartStorm in which I pick out 10 charts on the S P 500 to tweet  Typically I ll pick a couple of themes and hammer them home with the charts  but sometimes it s just a selection of charts that will add to your perspective and help inform your own view   whether it s bearish  bullish  or something else 
The purpose of this note is to add some extra context beyond the 140 characters of Twitter  It s worth noting that the aim of the  ChartStorm isn t necessarily to arrive at a certain view but to highlight charts and themes worth paying attention to 
So here s the another S P 500  ChartStorm write up 
1  An Unfortunate Analog  Analog charts are often interesting and always dubious  but there is obviously merit in looking at historical scenarios and drawing parallels and lessons  In this case   shared by Lance Roberts  and originally featured on   shows an apparent similarity between today s market and the 1987 episode  I can t give an assurance either way on this one  other than saying here it is and make your own mind up 
Bottom line  According to some analysts there are some similarities between now and 1987 

2  Cash Holdings  This good chart shared by  shows the cash balances of clients at Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW   It mirrors what we ve previously shown of AAII portfolio allocation surveys and the implied money market mutual fund allocations as a percentage of total mutual fund assets  In other words  there are numerous sources saying retail has a very low cash allocation  When you think about high valuations across asset classes  it makes you think maybe cash is not as bad as people seem to be implying that it is 
Bottom line  Cash allocations are around all time lows 

3  Stockmarket Leverage  Nice follow on from the previous chart  this one shows     so not only are cash allocations low  but it looks like punters are even leveraging up  It s certainly not something you see at the bottom  All up there has been about  400B in leverage added over the past 5 years 
Bottom line  Investors have leveraged up 

4  Gold vs S P 500  From chart master   this one shows the ratio of SPDR Gold Shares ETF  NYSE GLD  and SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  and seems to imply a rise in the ratio  For clarity a rise in the ratio would be spurred by either or a combination of gold shooting higher  not my     or by the S P 500 headed lower  Time will tell  but for now there is an interesting range being played here by this pair 
Bottom line  The gold vs S P 500 ratio may be about to head higher 

5  Have You Ever Seen A     Not a chart but an   can t think of a better description   which shows how many bear markets you would have lived through if you were born on certain years  Hidden in this is a nod to the point that in the early 1900 s economic volatility was a lot higher  whereas nowadays with countercyclical macroeconomic policy  more diversified economies and industries and a more integrated global economy  economic volatility is lower  and hence bear markets have become less common   but not extinct 
Bottom line  How many bear markets have you seen in your life 

6  The Fed Sweet Spot  This  puts the Fed Funds rate into context to yield insights as to how it interacts with business cycles and of course the market cycle  The so called sweet spot is when wage growth is higher  the higher the better  relative to the level of the fed funds interest rate  Seems when it goes negative it triggers signals the end of the cycle  We are headed in that direction  but not there yet 
Bottom line  We are leaving the Fed sweet spot 

7  S P 500 Forward P E raio  Interesting chart here on valuations   by Urban Carmel  shows the forward PE  price by next 12 months earnings  falling back to the 25 year average  Might have to reassess that assertion that US stocks are expensive  Better to see would be a reversion below average for it to register as  cheap   Also note the valuations table inset within the chart 
Bottom line  The S P 500 is no longer expensive on this view 

8  Earnings Guidance  With all the kerfuffle in the markets it s easy to lose sight of  at the moment  Turns out more companies than usual are providing positive pre announcements  according to FactSet  Perhaps surprising to some will be the path of the tech sector  Lot of hype in tech  but a lot of earnings too 
Bottom line  Just seen a record in positive earnings guidance for Q1 

9  Dividend Growth  One thing that sometimes happens when profits grow is that companies pay more of those profits out to investors  not sarcasm  because they can just as easily do other things with said earnings e g  pay down debt  do R D  capex  M A  buybacks  sit on it  etc   Anyway  it is positive to see  apparently accelerating  and it goes to show all is not doom and gloom 
Bottom line  Dividend growth is accelerating 

10  Emerging Markets Equities vs the S P 500  As I talked about the other day   appear to undergo long cycles of under out performance against the S P 500 and it looks like a new cycle is getting underway  One thing that would support this would be the big valuation gap  EM equities are still cheap relative to more richly priced US equities   and EM economies are earlier on in their economic cycle  Certainly food for thought 
Bottom line  EM equities  relative performance outlook is bright 

So where does all this leave us 
This week there s really two main categories the charts fit into 
1  Flagon Half Empty 
In this camp obviously falls the first chart  the 1987 crash analog   the record low cash allocations chart  the extensive stockmarket leverage buildup  the gold vs SPY ratio  and I suppose also the bear market witnessing schematic 
2  Chalice Half Full 
In this camp you ve got the neutralization in valuations  record high positive earnings guidance  accelerating dividend growth  maybe the fed funds sweetspot since it s not quite in the negatives yet  and maybe also the EM relative chart  but that s more positive for EM 
Summary
It s a very interesting market environment at the moment  The market is in the middle of what is largely a sentiment driven selloff catalyzed by a stream of negative headlines   and what was a market that was receptive or vulnerable to a correction  In the mean time  you also have a number of positive undercurrents such as accelerating earnings  The thing about sentiment driven selloffs is that they are usually something to buy  but they are by nature liable or vulnerable to feeding on themselves  and so it could easily go further ",2018-04-08,Callum Thomas,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weekly-sp-500-chartstorm--8-apr-2018-200303810,200303810

195300,416816,SCHW,Trade Up To These 3 Online Brokers With Explosive Earnings Growth,opinion,"The landscape in the retail brokerage industry has certainly changed   Once the exclusive territory of full service brokers and big investment banks who charged up to 5  of the value of a trade to execute the purchase and sale of stocks  the industry is now dominated by what used to be known as  discount brokers  who operate primarily online and offer fast executions and previously unheard of prices   in some cases as low as a few dollars per trade 
While some investors still choose the attention of a traditional broker  most active and self directed investors now use a discount broker to buy and sell not only stocks  but also options  futures and even currencies
The Original Discount Broker
Charles Schwab    was the pioneer of the discount brokerage industry  The first major house to offer lighter services for reduced commissions and fees  they ve been synonymous with the discount brokerage industry since the beginning 
Offering a wide range of investment services including both ordinary discount brokerage and more hands on advice through a network of independent advisors  Schwab was the beneficiary of increased trading volumes during the volatile first quarter of 2018 and reported record revenues with sales of  2 4B  up 15  from the same quarter in 2017 
Brokers also typically benefit from higher interest rates as it increases the amount they collect on margin balances and Schwab saw net interest margins increase to 2 2  from 1 87 a year earlier 
Despite higher costs for employee compensation and a one time charge due to a  15M loss in unsecured losses by customers in volatility products  Schwab earned  783M in the quarter  or  0 55 share  a 41  increase over last year   With 6 analyst upgrades in the past 30 days  Charles Schwab is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but has a strong possibility of changing soon 
The Online Pioneer
E trade Financial Corporation    was one the first discount brokers to concentrate on an online presence   in the mid 1990s   and has been a favorite of actively trading customers ever since 
Just like competitor Charles Schwab  they were a big beneficiary of the market volatility early in the year  posting results last Thursday that set all time records for revenues  operating margins  trading revenue  margin balances and net asset flows 
Beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  E Trade reported earnings of  0 88 share and the positive language in the report has prompted 5 analysts to raise their forecasts for 2018  resulting in a Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 53 Share  up from  3 11 90 days ago 
Etrade is a Zacks rank  1  Strong Buy  
Former Market Maker Turned Broker
Growing from options market making giant Timber Hill  Interactive Brokers    has found that using its platform for market access as a broker is considerably more profitable in terms of both revenues and net earnings   
Interactive brokers caters to sophisticated individual investors and advisors  offering tools and services to what professional traders use  but at discount prices  They offer trading in multiple asset classes worldwide in a single account and from a single interface 
After selling the underperforming Timber Hill market making division in 2017  Interactive brokers has registered double digit earnings surprises in each of the last three quarters and seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate rise to  2 21 share for 2018  a 44  increase from the  1 53 reported in 2017  earning a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    The stock price has been rewarded in kind  rising from the mid 30s in the summer of 2017 to close at  73 80 on Friday  giving it a Momentum score of  A  
Though the volatility that aided the results of the discount brokers last quarter seems to have subsided somewhat in recent weeks  the prospect of trade wars  geopolitical risk and the coming mid term elections all increase the probability that we ll see more volatile markets throughout 2018

195302,416818,SCHW,Stranded money  Investors can face peril when ETNs delist,news,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors are rushing to get out of a top exchange traded note before it stops trading publicly  and those who fail to find a buyer may be stuck for years in a widely misunderstood product 
 Credit Suisse  s  1 1 billion VelocityShares 3x Long Crude Oil ETN  UWTI  is poised on Thursday to become the largest ever note to be delisted from U S  exchanges 
Investors hold  22 billion of U S  ETNs which  like debt  constitute a pledge by an issuer  Payouts are based on the performance of the underlying asset  but the notes do not  hold  those assets  unlike ETFs to which they are often compared 
UWTI is widely used by mom and pop investors  many of whom are unaware of these differences and may find out too late  analysts said 
Banks  under regulatory pressure to cut risk since the financial crisis  have been issuing fewer ETNs and delisting existing ones to focus on their core businesses 
It is rare for a delisting to come without a new redemption option for investors who retain the product  Credit Suisse s move may make investors wary of ETNs 
 The benefits of ETNs  in most segments of the market  are not that great   said Michael Iachini  managing director of mutual fund and exchange traded fund  ETF  research at  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  Investment Advisory Inc   It s not a great loss  
Upon delisting  ETF holders are typically paid out in cash while ETN holders are at the mercy of the issuer 
After that  investors looking to sell would be forced to find a buyer  over the counter   where investors are not guaranteed anything close to what the notes are worth 
Several traders and analysts expect Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  to announce plans to effectively redeem the remaining notes for cash  but the bank has not said whether it would do so 
Over the last decade  89 ETNs have closed out of a total of nearly 300 issued  according to fund researcher Morningstar Inc  The largest closure was last year  when Royal Bank of Scotland  LON RBS  Plc ended its stock tracking  478 million U S  Large Cap Trendpilot ETN 
Investors pulled nearly  675 million from UWTI in the two weeks through last Wednesday  according to fund researcher Thomson Reuters Lipper  The march toward their delisting has occurred despite a massive run up in oil prices which has boosted the ETN s price 
Credit Suisse said in a Nov  16 statement it would delist the ETN to better align  its product suite with its broader strategic growth plans  
Investors hold UWTI for six days  on average  according to  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  Securities Inc  Those who do not sell UWTI this week could be forced to hold the notes for years since they do not officially expire until February 2032 
Credit Suisse  which in 2014 said it would wind down its commodities trading  declined to comment on plans for the ETN 
VelocityShares  a Janus Capital Group Inc unit that provides services for the notes  also declined to comment 
Investors can book huge profits during oil price volatility  such as when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  agreed last week to curb crude production in a bid to support prices  Prices soared 
UWTI  which promises to multiply the return of an oil futures index by three  leapt 25 percent on Wednesday alone 
A smaller related ETN  the  222 million VelocityShares 3x Inverse Crude Oil ETN  is also delisting Thursday  The notes actually attracted  60 2 million in the latest week  Lipper said 
Yet  leveraged  ETNs  volatile results have led to disappointments  Brokers have been sanctioned for selling the products to retail investors for whom they were not suitable 
Credit Suisse was sued by investors who owned a leveraged ETN after new issuances of the notes were suspended  A federal appeals court in 2014 ruled in favor of Credit Suisse  saying no reasonable investor could have read its disclosures without understanding the notes  risk 
Institutions account for only 16 percent of the funds  owners  according to a Deutsche Bank analysis  TD Ameritrade Inc  a retail focused broker  said UWTI was among the most popular securities traded by millennials last year 
Issuers are not always willing to help after a fund is delisted  said Mariana Bush  head of closed end fund and exchange traded product research at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Advisors  who has helped financial advisers at the bank liquidate positions in delisted ETNs 
 It was a nightmare   she said   Investors should be aware of it and should try to think about an exit strategy  ",2016-12-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stranded-money:-investors-can-face-peril-when-etns-delist-445761,445761

People usually associate a bull market with growth factors  The U S  economy grew 2 3  in 2017 against  decline in 2009  Growth stocks and ETFs are assumed to deliver stellar performance in such a scenario 
But surprisingly several value ETFs have emerged winners in the nine year bull market  Of the top ten unleveraged ETF winners  three are actually  pure value  funds from Guggenheim  which even surpassed sizzling Internet ETFs like PowerShares NASDAQ Internet ETF   read    
Let s find out how 
Inside Value ETFs  Outperformance 
The last nine years have been marked by several ups and downs  Though the Fed supported the market   which was reeling under the pressure of the subprime mortgage crisis   with its ultra policy monetary policy and QE rollouts  global growth worries persisted  The Eurozone debt crisis was a major deterrent during this period 
Apart from this  the Taper Tantrum in the United States in 2013  China s soft landing issues  deflationary fears in Japan and the oil price massacre continued to pose threats to the market rally at regular intervals  In short  the rally was hardly frictionless 
Probably this is why the current bull market is also called the   ever  Most market watchers appear  cautiously optimistic  about the Wall Street rally  if we go by an article published on Wall Street Journal 
Though the S P 500   in value since March 2009  skepticism persists  Actually  people who have seen the dot com bubble burst in 2001 and survived the financial crisis in 2007 2008 probably have now become more cautious and less speculative 
Investors now fear overvaluations amid market complacency  They are also worried about global central bank movements as easy money was the key thing that drove Wall Street this high  Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW   which takes care of more than  3 trillion in retail investments  noted late last year that investors  their entire savings into the stock market 
This is where the popularity of value ETFs lies  Value funds offer exposure to a wide variety of stocks with value characteristics  such as low P B  low P S and low P E ratios  The perception is that the lower the ratio  the higher will be the value of the stock 
The simple logic is that a stock s current market price does not justify  is not equivalent to  its higher earnings  sales or book value   These stocks tend to be better bets in an uncertain environment  read

195311,416827,SCHW,U S  options market not very  Trumped up  ahead of vote,news,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK  Reuters    Prospects that the presidential election will inject a hefty dose of volatility into U S  stock markets are fading fast as Republican Donald Trump s victory odds lengthen  A reading of positioning data on options tied to the benchmark S P 500 index shows little pickup in demand for contracts that would offer investors downside insurance in the event that stock prices take a major hit right after the Nov  8 election  Moreover  based on options term structures   calculated from prices of options with different expirations   it is hardly evident at all that investors are positioning for an uncertain outcome  even with Election Day barely two weeks away  Michael Purves  head of derivatives research at Weeden   Co  said   There had been a modest premium bump for November options a few weeks ago  but that seems to have faded steadily with Trump s slide in polls   Purves said  In a Reuters poll of equity strategists earlier this month  a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton was viewed as the more positive outcome for stock prices in the near term   Trump s chances of defeating Clinton to capture the White House have diminished markedly over the last several weeks  according to most polls and prediction markets  The Reuters Ipsos States of the Nation project  which uses an online opinion poll to project election outcomes in all 50 states  estimates that Clinton has a better than 95 percent chance of winning the minimum of 270 Electoral College votes to claim the presidency if the election were held today  The most likely outcome would be 326 votes for Clinton to 212 for Trump  On PredictIt  a popular online predictions and betting market  Clinton s implied chances of victory have risen to around 80 percent from around 63 percent a month ago  NO RUSH FOR INSURANCE  The lack of positioning for an election related volatility shock is consistent across the options market   I just don t see a whole lot of shifting of positions  I don t see people taking on a very bearish stance or anything like that  It s a little bit surprising   said Randy Frederick  managing director  trading and derivatives at  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW   Austin  Texas   If it was a much closer race it might have been a different story  but the polls have Hillary Clinton in a pretty solid lead right now and the market seems to be on board with that idea   Frederick said  A Brookings Institution study published on Friday from two U S  economics professors concluded that a Clinton victory would further suppress stock market volatility  whereas a Trump victory would send it soaring  Justin Wolfers  of the University of Michigan  and Eric Zitzewitz  of Dartmouth College  said recent market reactions to pre election events  including the first Trump Clinton debate and the release of a video of Trump making vulgar comments about women  signal that equity volatility could fall by 15 to 30 percent with a Clinton win     TRUMP  INSURANCE  IS CHEAP While the options market might be only a moderate catalyst for the S P 500 index  individual sectors such as healthcare and energy might be more prone to election related volatility  derivatives analysts at  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  said in a recent note  And just because investors are not braced for election linked stock gyrations is no guarantee that markets will remain calm  analysts said  Given that the market is not pricing a lot of volatility for November  the absence of positioning could aggravate a volatility shock in the event of a surprise result   If you think Trump will win  you want to get long SPX puts or long CBOE Volatility Index calls right now as protection   said Purves  referring to options contracts that profit from a jump in volatility  A clean sweep by the Democrats of the House of Representatives  the Senate and the White House could also unleash volatility  Purves said  Indeed  there is a very modest skew toward protective put options over more bullish calls among contracts expiring near the election  For S P 500 index weekly contracts expiring on Nov  11  puts outnumber calls by a 2 1 to 1 margin  compared with 1 9 to 1 for all expirations  according to Thomson Reuters data  Prices for at the money put and call contracts that expire on the eve of the election suggest a 1 8 percent move  up or down  in the S P 500 by then  while comparable contracts expiring later that week see an up or down move of 2 1 percent  Nonetheless  demand for volatility protection remains low and such options are relatively cheap  and getting cheaper   For instance  the cost for an S P index option conveying the right to sell an S P index future at the 2 050 level  about 4 percent below Friday s close  and expiring on Nov  9  the day after the election  has plunged from  12 42 on Monday to  4 80 on Friday  a 61 percent decline  With Trump trailing in opinion polls  the focus ahead of the Nov  8 vote is shifting to whether Republicans can keep their narrow majority in the Senate or even their larger advantage in the House of

195333,416849,SCHW,EUR USD ticks up  as dollar weakens amid soft U S  GDP data,news,"Investing com    EUR USD rose moderately on Tuesday on a thin day of trading  as soft U S  GDP data weighed heavily on a steadily weakening dollar 
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1 0902 and 1 0984 before settling at 1 0954  up 0 0039 or 0 36  on the session  The euro is enjoying a modest three day winning streak versus the dollar and is up by 0 26  against its American counterpart since the Federal Reserve raised short term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade last week  More broadly  the euro is up by more than 3 20  against the dollar since the European Central Bank rattled global currency markets by only instituting limited easing measures with comprehensive asset purchasing program at a closely watched meeting at the start of the month  The dollar is currently down by nearly 2  against a basket of rivals in December  suffering its worst month since April 
EUR USD likely gained support at 1 0538  the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1 1496  the high from Oct  15 
The moves by the Fed and the ECB over the last several weeks could portend further divergence between the two major central banks  as the Fed completes the early stages of its first tightening cycle since 2004  Earlier this week  analysts from  Charles Schwab   N SCHW  said 20 central banks  representing roughly one third of global GDP  hiked interest rates in 2015  marking a sharp divergence from recent monetary policy over the past several years  More importantly  the analysts noted that  volatility may result as the widening divergence contributes to the challenges facing some markets   Markets throughout the euro zone may be equipped to handle the shifts in monetary policy  according to Schwab  amid signs of improving economic and financial growth  
On Tuesday morning  the U S  Department of Commerce s Bureau of Economic Analysis  BEA  said real gross domestic product in the third quarter increased at a rate of 2 0   down sharply from annual GDP growth of 3 9  in the second quarter of 2015  The BEA s third estimate released on Tuesday also fell slightly from its second estimate of 2 1  growth issued last month  Real GDP measures the value of the goods and services produced by a nation s economy minus the goods and services used up in production  adjusted for price changes 
The BEA noted in its statement that the mild increase in real GDP is reflected in positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures  PCE   nonresidential fixed investment  state and local government spending  residential fixed investment  and exports that were partly offset by a negative contribution from private inventory investment 
At the same time  the deceleration in GDP growth on a quarterly basis denoted a downturn in private inventory investment and exports  Inventory growth was downwardly revised by nearly  5 billion to  85 5 billion  as businesses held inventories down amid slumping sales  Nevertheless  quarterly real GDP fell in line with consensus estimates of growth of 2 0   The GDP Price Index  meanwhile  increased 1 3  on the quarter  remaining unchanged from the previous quarter 
Investors await Wednesday s monthly release of the PCE index for November for further indications on the gradual path the Fed may take in its first tightening cycle since 2004  Core PCE inflation  which strips out volatile food and energy prices  has remained below the Fed s targeted goal of 2  for every month over the last three years  In October  core PCE prices were up by 1 3  on a yearly basis  remaining flat from the prior month s reading 
In updated inflation forecasts released last week  the Fed projected that inflation will not reach its targeted objective until 2018  Last week  the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  raised the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points to 0 25 and 0 50

195338,416854,SCHW,Meet The New State Street Portfolio ETFs,opinion,"The investment management fee wars just escalated to a new level with the announcement that State Street is dropping expenses and re naming 15 of its diversified exchange traded funds  This transformed group will be dubbed the  SPDR Portfolio  series and is aimed squarely at the likes of Vanguard  BlackRock  and Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  in testing the ultimate boundaries of minimalist fund costs 
The new average expense ratio across all 15 SPDR portfolio ETFs is an astounding 0 06   with several offerings being listed for as low as 0 03   That s just  30 per year in embedded expenses for every  100 000 invested and marks a strong advancement for ETF portfolio construction  State Street has also partnered with TD Ameritrade to make these funds commission free to trade on their brokerage platform  further maximizing the total return of these funds for shareholders 
The portfolio series is split between 9 equity and 6 fixed income index funds based primarily on popular ETF industry benchmarks  Highlights include varying flavors of total market  market cap  international  dividend  and growth or value tilts  The bond funds are split between aggregate  corporate  and Treasury offerings of varying duration segments 
State Street has taken a unique tactic in this instance by re tooling existing ETFs with established track records and asset bases rather than launching fresh offerings  This will likely sit well with investors who covet battle tested ETFs over those with zero history in the market 
One of the more popular funds in this lineup is the SPDR Portfolio S P 500 Growth ETF     which has over  900 million in assets and charges an ultra low expense ratio of 0 04   The S P 500 Growth Index that SPYG tracks is comprised of 330 large cap U S  stocks culled from the broader S P 500 Index  These companies generally exhibit characteristics of sales growth  momentum  and earnings acceleration to be admitted to the index 

Another easy to use building block for diversification purposes is the SPDR Portfolio Total Stock Market ETF     This passive ETF tracks the venerable Russell 3000 Index with a rock bottom 0 03  expense ratio  The 3000 stocks in SPTM represents approximately 98  of the investable U S  stock market for a highly diverse and liquid basket of holdings 
A similarly broad based index ETF on the international side is the SPDR Portfolio World ex US ETF     This foreign stock fund tracks over 1 500 publicly traded securities of developed markets outside of the United States for just 0 04  expense annually  Top country allocations include Japan  United Kingdom  France  and Canada  SPDW has over  1 billion in total assets and has climbed more than 22  so far this year 
Those who want to further expand their international exposure can also consider the SPDR Portfolio Emerging Markets ETF     This index fund targets stocks within emerging market nations such as China  India  Russia  and Brazil 
Turning to the bond side of the portfolio  the SPDR Portfolio Aggregate Bond ETF    is likely to garner some attention for its miniscule 0 04  expense ratio  This ETF tracks the ubiquitous Bloomberg Barclays  LON BARC  U S  Aggregate Index and currently has over  1 billion in total assets that is likely to increase significantly because of this expense reduction 
The fixed income corner is also home to two well liked corporate bond funds in the SPDR Portfolio Short Term Corporate Bond ETF    and SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate Bond ETF     Each charges a modest 0 07  expense ratio and currently sport nearly  5 5 billion in combined assets 
The Bottom Line
The State Street portfolio series marks a new advancement for the passive investment movement and makes an immediate impact on existing shareholders with their ultra low fees  It s reasonable to assume that their partnership with TD Ameritrade will lead to steadier daily trading volume and eventually higher asset levels as well 
It s also my hope that this group will be expanded in future iterations to include enhanced indexes based on investment factors such as dividend growth  quality  momentum  and others  State Street also has the option of converting more of their existing ETFs to this model by reducing fees and working with brokerage platforms to enhance value for investors around the globe 
All told  the ETF industry fee wars continue to steadily chip away at expenses that lead to better net returns for those who use these flexible and transparent tools

195351,416867,SCHW,State Street Intensifies ETF Fee War ,opinion,"Since the launch of the first ETF almost 24 years back  the exchange traded fund industry has attained great heights  There are currently about 2 029 exchange traded products listed in the U S   with almost  3 24 trillion in assets under 
Several strategies have emerged  including active management  smart beta technique  thematic ETFs and many more  Some of these did see success and but many have failed to attract investors  attention  But one attribute has been famous among investors since the start  i e  investors  craving for low expense ratio management  read    
For a long period of time  the lowest cost corner of the market was dominated by Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  and Vanguard  But several other issuers are looking for a bigger pie in the ETF market and to that end have slashed their fees considerably in recent times  Among them  BlockRock and Fidelity deserve a special mention  read    
As a result  State Street s ETF operations failed to keep up with its key peers so far in 2017  State Street has hauled in  13 5 billion in net ETF inflows in the first nine months of this year while BlackRock has amassed about  194 billion and Vanguard has recorded  112 billion in   as per ETFGI  quoted on Financial Times 
SPDR S P 500  MX SPY    AX SPY   charging 9 bps in fees lost about  7 45 billion in assets so far this year whileiShares Core S P 500 ETF  charging 4 bps in fees added about  25 3 billion and Vanguard S P 500 ETF  gained about  10 4 billion in assets  In order to remain competitive  State Street    15 prevailing ETFs with very low expense ratios

Bottom Line
Competition in the ETF market is cut throat  So  the expense ratio war is likely to continue in the near term  Several asset managers are ready to further reduce fees to attract investors  fund and gain market share  So  the latest move by State Street should help it gain assets in the coming days

195353,416869,SCHW,U S  Labor Department unveils retirement brokers rule,news,By Sarah N  Lynch and Suzanne Barlyn WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Labor Department proposed sweeping changes on Tuesday that would require brokers who offer retirement advice to enter into  best interest  contracts with investors  in an effort to ensure customers are not steered into high fee products  Labor Secretary Tom Perez and his staff unveiled the long awaited plan  saying new rules are needed to protect consumers who may be getting investment advice that is driven more by what will line brokers  pockets  and not by their clients  best financial needs   The corrosive power of fine print and buried fees can eat away like a chronic disease at peoples  savings   Perez said  For about five years now  the Labor Department has been working to craft a workable rule to hold brokers who offer retirement account advice to a higher  fiduciary  standard   That means they would be required to put investors  financial interests ahead of their own  President Barack Obama threw his political muscle behind the proposal in February  saying Americans are too often the victims of hidden fees that are costing them billions of dollars each year in their retirement savings  If ultimately adopted  the rule would have an impact on brokerages large and small  from independent shops to firms such as Fidelity   Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  and Raymond James  Tuesday s draft contained some significant changes compared to a prior version  which the Labor Department was forced to scrap in 2011 amid widespread criticism from the industry  A signature piece of the new draft are so called  best interest  contracts in which brokers will be required to pledge to uphold their clients  best interests  Such contracts must assure clients that the brokerages have policies and procedures in place to mitigate conflicts of interest  If customers feel the contract was breached  they would be allowed to enforce it against the broker through a private right of action  such as arbitration  The Internal Revenue Service would also be able to impose an excise tax on transactions that were based on conflicted advice  How Wall Street may react to the plan remains to be seen  The industry has warned that overly strict rules could limit retirement products available to investors because fewer brokerages would be prepared to offer individual retirement accounts or advise lower income Americans on them  The industry also fears the proposed new rules may fundamentally change the compensation structure for brokers by requiring more investors to pay fees based on a percentage of their assets instead of commissions   That would hurt profits on such products and  as a result  brokers would pull back from offering accounts and advice  industry groups say  The industry is also concerned about how any final rule from the Labor Department will square with another measure being developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission  which regulates all U S  brokerages  The SEC s plan would aim to harmonize differences in ethical standards between brokers and investment advisers  Advisers by law are already held to a high fiduciary duty  while brokers are held to a lower  suitability  standard  The Labor Department and the SEC are governed by different laws  and while they have coordinated  they are each acting independently  But the two differing rules will apply to the same swath of companies  potentially complicating compliance efforts   The industry has urged the Labor Department to take a back seat and let the SEC take the lead and issue its own fiduciary proposal first ,2015-04-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/labor-department-to-unveil-consumer-protection-plan-337006,337006

195362,416878,SCHW,Obama takes aim at brokers  fees on U S  retirement accounts,news,"By Jeff Mason and Sarah N  Lynch WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  brokers and financial advisers would face new constraints under a plan President Barack Obama put forward on Monday to reduce conflicts of interest and  hidden fees  that cost Americans billions of dollars in retirement savings every year  In proposing the rules  Obama said he sought to protect Americans from being steered into costly retirement investments that produced high commissions for brokers but low returns for investors preparing for retirement  Democrats and Republicans are trying to position themselves as champions of the middle class in the run up to the November 2016 presidential election  Retired seniors are an important voting bloc  The proposed rules  which the Department of Labor is expected to submit formally in the coming months  will inject political pressure into an already intense debate over brokers  obligations  They would have an impact on thousands of brokerages  from large players such as Fidelity  Wells Fargo  N WFC   Charles Schwab  N SCHW  and Raymond James  N RJF   to smaller  independent shops   Brokers would be held to a higher  fiduciary standard   requiring them to put their clients  financial interests ahead of their own   The White House said the proposals target fees and payments that on average lead to a full percentage point lower annual return on retirement savings at a cost to Americans of  17 billion a year  In particular  Obama called for new rules preventing retirement brokers from steering clients  savings into funds with higher fees and lower returns  or advising clients to roll their funds over into higher cost plans  Speaking at an event hosted by the AARP Inc  formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons  Obama said   It s a very simple principle  You want to give financial advice  you ve got to put your client s interests first  You can t have a conflict of interest    The proposal is opposed by many Republicans  financial firms and some of Obama s fellow Democrats who fear the plan will limit retirement products available to investors and curb brokers  compensation  Wall Street groups have lobbied for years against efforts by the Labor Department to adopt a new fiduciary rule  forcing the department in 2011 to scrap its first draft of the plan  Secretary of Labor Tom Perez said on Sunday in a call with reporters that the new proposal would incorporate feedback from the previous failed attempt   We expect that the proposed rule will not ban commissions or any common compensation practices  and it will allow financial advisers to continue providing general education on retirement savings   he said  citing some of the differences with the previous proposal  The industry is predicting rapid growth in retirement accounts  Boston based Cerulli Associates said that in 2013  U S  investors rolled over an estimated  352 9 billion into IRAs from employer sponsored retirement plans  New rollovers from such plans will balloon to an estimated  546 1 billion in 2019  Cerulli said  IRAs are individual retirement accounts  MIDDLE CLASS ISSUES Reform advocates welcomed the announcement   The president s involvement     on this issue from our perspective is a very positive sign   said Shaun O Brien  an assistant policy director for health and retirement with the AFL CIO  a federation of labor groups  Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren  a consumer advocate who some Democrats hope will challenge Hillary Clinton for the party s presidential nomination  joined Obama at the event   The speech prompted swift reaction from Capitol Hill  Missouri Republican Representative Ann Wagner  the sponsor of past legislation to delay the Labor Department s efforts  pledged to put forth new legislation later this week to  preserve options for Americans to obtain financial advice   In 2013  Wagner s prior bill generated some bipartisan support and passed in the House by a vote of 254 166  Some Democrats who supported that bill have since shifted  Representative John Delaney of Maryland  who attended the event with Obama  told Reuters in a statement on Monday that since the bill passed   reams of additional data have been released  showing the need for new rules   DIFFERENT STANDARDS In their pushback against the Labor Department s efforts  Wall Street groups have also cited a lack of coordination with the Securities and Exchange Commission  The SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority oversee largely the same pool of brokers as Labor  but they have different legal regimes  The SEC for years has considered adopting its own uniform fiduciary rule for retail brokers and advisers  but remains divided  Under current SEC rules  advisers are held to a higher  fiduciary  standard while brokers are held to a lower  suitability  standard  meaning they must sell  suitable  products even if they are not the most cost effective  Ken Bentsen  president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  said the SEC is the appropriate entity to consider any new rules  and called the White House s research supporting reforms inadequate  
Bentsen said Obama s announcement  juts a lot of politics into what is a very serious matter  ",2015-02-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/obama-presses-new-rule-for-broker-advice-on-retirement-investments-329212,329212

195370,416886,SCHW,Will Low Cost ETF Strength Make Vanguard Top Asset Manager Soon ,opinion,"Since the launch of the first ETF almost 24 years back  the exchange traded fund industry has attained great heights  There are currently about 2 061 exchange traded products listed in the U S   with almost  3 06 trillion in assets under management  read    
Several strategies have emerged  including active management  smart beta technique  thematic ETFs and many more  Some of these did see success and but many have failed to attract investors  attention  But one attribute has been famous among investors since the start  i e  investors  craving for low expense ratio 
Why Cost Is an Important Factor
Consider an expense ratio of 1   a fund of  10 000 invested at 8  annual return will grow to  19 672 in 10 years  while the same fund invested at an expense ratio of 0 1  will grow by a higher amount of  21 390  The difference between the returns will zoom on increasing the holding period 
Considering the same parameters  with an expense ratio of 0 1   a fund of  10 000 will grow to  97 869 in 30 years  at the same 8  rate of return   The same fund will however grow to a much lesser value of  76 123 with an expense ratio of 1   In the long run  cheaper funds can drastically outperform the expensive ones  at least when other factors remain constant 
Vanguard Breathing Down BlackRock s Neck
So far  the lowest cost corner was ruled by Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  and Vanguard  But the price war among issuers aggravated lately with competition on the rise  Other players like BlackRock are also resorting to the fee cut route to grab market share  read    
Whatever the case  thanks mainly to its low cost products  new business in Vanguard is taking big strides   Investors have sunk a net  1 3tn into Vanguard s funds since the start of 2012  whereas BlackRock has drawn  762bn over the same period   as per an article published on Financial Times 
Two years back  the average expense ratio of a Vanguard ETF was  compared with the industry average of 0 58  and BlackRock s average expense ratio is 0 32   The average expense ratio of Vanguard s U S  asset weighted fund expenses as a percentage of 2016 average net assets is  
With BlackRock aggressively slashing expense ratios for many of its products  it is evident that BlackRock s current average fees have come down a lot  but is still not near Vanguard  This is because  in a  race to zero  Vanguard is also not sitting idle  As the price war heats up  Vanguard also enacted deep fee cuts 
The asset manager intends to broaden its global footprint by opening an office in Germany  and one in Mexico  It entered Shanghai in May  as per Financial Times  read    
However  there is a different view as well  As per the chief executive of Create Research  it is tough for Vanguard to dethrone BlackRock  He added that  Vanguard would also be more vulnerable than BlackRock in the event of a market downturn  as passive funds account for three quarters of Vanguard s assets  compared with 63  of BlackRock s  Given the huge weight of money in Vanguard s passive funds  its asset base will suffer a disproportionate hit in the next bear market   as per the article published on

195371,416887,SCHW,Why Are ETFs Beating Hedge Funds On Assets   Returns ,opinion,"By now  the ETF Industry s exponential growth is known to all  The industry has gained immense popularity within just over 20 years  There are close to 2 050 U S  listed ETFs to date with  3 06 trillion in assets  Not only this  a considerable number of ETFs are in the pipeline  pointing to growing investor interest for exchange traded products in this market  read    
Consulting firm  reported that assets invested in global ETFs ETPs touched a new record of  4 168 trillion at the end of first half of 2017  There were at least 6 965 ETFs ETPs from 328 providers listed on 70 exchanges in 56 countries  read    
The popularity led ETFs to garner  1 trillion more investor assets than hedge funds globally for the first time ever at the end of June  according to ETFGI  Assets in ETFs first topped hedge funds two years ago  and has maintained the momentum since then 
During 2016  globally listed ETFs ETPs amassed a record  of net inflows  superseding the prior record of  372 3 billion gathered in 2015  By the end of December 2016  ETFs ETPs had registered 35 successive months of net inflows  On the other hand  hedge fund investors pulled out  70 1 billion  the largest annual outflow since 2009  when  131 0 billion was extracted  according to ETFGI 
In the first half of this year  ETFs around the world attracted a net  347 7 billion in net new assets  according to ETFGI  while hedge funds drew a net  1 2 billion  according to HFR  going by an article published on  
Let s find out the reason behind ETFs  upper hand over hedge funds 
Higher Returns in ETFs Than Hedge Funds
Hedge funds are privately owned companies that invest investors  money into several complicated and exotic financial instruments with a motive to outperform the market  by a wide margin  But in reality  hedge funds underperformed the market in recent times 
The below mentioned source indicates that returns from the S P 500 have consistently outperformed hedge funds since 2011  This piece of information is strong enough to drive investors toward ETFs and shy away from hedge funds 

 
ETF Fees Lower Than Hedge Funds
As per an article published on    the standard management fees charged by hedge funds  including a common 2  annual management fee and as much as 20  of the profits over a certain hurdle rate  appear costlier than what an ETF charges  Hedge funds  active management leads to this higher cost 
Average expense ratio of U S  listed ETFs is 0 59   with many popular ETFs like Schwab U S  Broad Market ETF   KL SCHB    Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF   AX VTI   andiShares Core S P 500 ETF  charging as low as 0 3  to 0 4   read  
So far  the lowest cost corner was ruled by Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  and Vanguard  But the price war among issuers aggravated lately with competition on the rise  Other players like BlackRock are also resorting to the fee cut route to grab market share  read    
ETFs Are More Regulated Than Hedge Funds
Though Hedge funds with assets under management  are required to register with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC   However  a hedge fund advisor may evade registration with the SEC if he qualifies for the private fund advisor exemption under the Dodd Frank Act  as per Investopedia 
On the other hand  ETFs are much more regulated  With the Department of Labor  DoL  fiduciary rule   which requires financial advisors to work in the  best interest  of their clients when selling retirement products   taking effect earlier    things are likely to become more lucrative for ETF investing  read    
ETF Investors  Coverage Wider than Hedge Funds            
While ETFs have attracted retail investors mainly along with institutional investors like sovereign wealth funds   and professional asset managers  hedge funds  clientele mainly concentrates on HNIs  As a result  in the period of underperformance  the clientele coverage of hedge funds gets reduced 
In fact  the hedge fund industry has lately been targeting ETFs  success to generate their own returns   of senior hedge fund professionals expect an increased usage of ETFs within their industry this year 
Hedge Fund ETFs
Still investors having an inclination for hedge funds may reach that segments by targeting hedge fund ETFs  This way investors can easily beat the beleaguered investing zone  Below we highlight a few ETFs that have returned 8  to 16  this year 
AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF   ST ALFA     Up 16 7 
The underlying index of the fund   AlphaClone Hedge Fund Downside Hedged Index   tracks the performance of U S  traded equity securities to which hedge funds and institutional investors have disclosed significant exposure  The fund charges 95 bps in fees

 NEW YORK  Sept 9  Reuters    Fears over Europe s festering
debt problems punished global stocks and the euro on Friday as
the stakes intensified for the world s top finance officials to
find ways to prevent the crisis from spiraling out of control 
 The euro hit 6 1 2 month lows against the dollar  with more
declines likely after the European Central Bank shifted away
from further rises in interest rates  a key driver in the
single currency s rally this year 
 Nervousness over the outcome of a Greek debt swap deal
fueled safe haven buying of German and U S  government debt 
The 10 year Bund yield hit another record low  while yields on
benchmark U S  Treasuries touched a 60 year trough 
  Europe is the No  1 thing causing pressure on the market

investment strategist at Charles Schwab Corp  which has  1 65

turmoil on the ECB  that immediately has implications for the
bond buying program  which immediately has implications on the
capital level in European banks   said Jack de Gan  chief
investment officer at Harbor Advisory Corp in Portsmouth  New
Hampshire 
 The debt swap deal is critical for Greece to secure a
second bailout and avert a near term default that could ripple
across Europe and the global banking system 
 Banks and insurers face a Friday deadline to indicate
whether they will join an exchange of Greek debt  part of an
international bailout package agreed in July  It is expected 70
percent of these private investors would agree to such a move 
below the 90 percent threshold that Greece has said it wants to
go through with the deal  For more  see  ID nLDE7880AH 
 The cost to insure Greek sovereign debt for five years
surged to a record high of 3 106 basis points  up nearly 300

195379,416895,SCHW,Using Technical Indicators To Assist With Strike Selection,opinion,"When selling covered call or put options  strike price selection is one of the three required skills  Here are the main factors we evaluate when determining which strike price to select 

Overall market assessment
Personal risk tolerance
Return goals
Technical price chart

In this article  we will focus in on the technical parameters that will guide us to the strike price that will offer the greatest chance of successful covered call trades  To highlight the relationship between price chart patterns and strike price selection  we will use real life examples for NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  and Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW   Charts and calculations were created the weekend prior to the start of the January 2017 monthly contracts  At the time  NVDA had a bullish technical chart pattern while SCHW had a mixed technical chart 

BCI guidelines for the relationship between chart patterns and call strike selection

We will favor  that meet our return goals when there is a bullish chart pattern and  that meet our goals when charts show mixed indicators  We will assume a goal for initial returns of 2    4  per month 


NVDA  Bullish chart pattern


NVDA Technical Chart  12 2016


SCHW  Mixed chart pattern


SCHW  Mixed technical Chart Pattern


Calculations based on technical analysis

The option chains for the two securities where analyzed specifically looking for out of the money strikes for NVDA and in the money strikes for SCHW that generated an initial time value 1 month return of 2    4   The information was entered into the multiple tab of the Ellman Calculator 


Calculating Initial Returns for NVDA and SCHW

Note the following 

Yellow field  The  return for both options did meet our goals of 2    4 
Brown field  The out of the money  105 00 strike for NVDA offered the opportunity of an additional 4 6   1 month return if share price moved up to the strike by expiration resulting in a potential 7 1   1 month return
Purple field  The in the money  38 00 strike for SCHW offered a 2 1  downside protection of the 2 6   initial return  I view this as an insurance policy on the initial profit paid for by the option buyer  not by us 


Discussion

 By Julie Haviv
 NEW YORK  April 15  Reuters    The euro succumbed to
sovereign debt fears on Friday  but the single currency should
remain range bound or even rebound against the dollar as loose
U S  Federal Reserve monetary policy goes head to head with a
hawkish European Central Bank 
 Peripheral sovereign debt concerns have mostly been
outweighed by rate expectations this year  but nevertheless the
euro has suffered from setbacks along the way  with Friday no
exception after Moody s cut Ireland s rating to just above
 junk  status   ID nLDE73E0DU 
 In early afternoon New York trading  the euro  was
down 0 4 percent at  1 4436  well below a 15 month high of
 1 4521 touched earlier this week  The euro was down about 0 3
percent so far this week 
 Traders said market ran stop orders below  1 4430  pushing
the euro to session lows at  1 4407 on electronic trading
platform EBS 
 The options market suggests euro zone debt worries are not
at the forefront of investors  minds  Benchmark volatilities
implied by one month at the money euro dollar options 
was around 9 35 percent on Friday  near a one year low 
 Six month  and one year implied vols 
remained elevated though  trading at 11 45 percent and 12 25

reassuring about inflation  and data on Friday supported that

 To many economists the data affirmed expectations that the
Fed would not raise rates until early next year 
 The ECB  meanwhile  raised rates to 1 25 percent from 1
percent last week  its first rate hike since July 2008 
 Euro zone inflation numbers surprised on the upside 
reinforcing views the ECB will continue to raise rates in the
coming months   ID nBRLFFE7CY 
  A year from now  the ECB may have navigated the exit from
accommodative policies  at the point at which the FOMC  Federal
Open Market Committee  will be about to raise rates   said Jens
Larsen  chief European economist at RBC Capital Markets in
London 
  If the ECB hike does not cause a significant slowing of
growth in the euro area  or a sharp deterioration in the
periphery  then the pre emptive strategy may well be judged
successful  
 Investors are pricing in the chances of two more ECB rate
increases before the end of this year  
  The interest rate differential argument has clearly
supported the euro the last few weeks   said Greg Salvaggio 
senior vice president for capital markets at Tempus Consulting
in Washington 
  The ECB has hiked rates and will probably hike again by
the end of the summer and now the question is what will the Fed
do  Clearly this benign inflation data that we got this morning
won t push the Fed quickly to hike rates  
 Market players said the euro could find the going tough
above  1 45 given concerns about sovereign debt problems  which
escalated this week as fears about a possible Greek
restructuring intensified   ID nLDE73D0XQ 
 The U S  stock market  meanwhile  is reflecting a  risk on 
stance  with the Standard   Poor s  500 stock index up 5
percent this year 
 Charles Schwab Corp   the largest U S  discount
brokerage  posted higher than forecast earnings  Chairman
Charles Schwab said in a statement that clients had reduced
their cash holdings at Schwab to levels not seen since before
the financial crisis of 2008 and are investing more money in
stocks   nN14177981 
 The dollar was down 0 4 percent at 83 12 yen   but
losses were limited  The greenback has fallen in six of the
last seven sessions and was on track for its worst weekly
performance in about nine months with losses this week of 2 1

Answer  Far too much debt and currency are created 
Central Bank Balance Sheets have increased by  10 trillion in the last decade and  1 trillion YTD in 2017 

What happens when an extra  10 trillion in central bank debt plus another  80 trillion or so in other global debt is created in a decade 
Answer  Prices rise because each fiat currency unit purchases less 

The debt creation  money hose  levitated the NASDAQ and other stock markets  the bond market  and most commodities  Crude Oil  like gold and silver  rallied much higher and then crashed 
In the U S  the Dow  S P 500  and NASDAQ appear healthy while the economy  employment  and middle class limp along  Many pension funds  after nearly a decade of levitated stock market returns and repressed interest rates  look like a train wreck in the next decade 
Are we close to a blast that will explode our financial world  It hardly matters what the fuse will be  but a few come to mind 

Escalating war in Syria  Middle East  and or North Korea 
Government shut down and loss of confidence in the administration and congress 
Derivative crisis  similar to 2008 meltdown 
Collapse of the Euro and EU 
German or Italian banks implode 
Global dollar crash and rise of the SDR as the new  trading currency  
Federal Reserve revival of Quantitative Easing and more aggressive dollar devaluations 

Regardless of which  snowflake   The James Rickards example  causes the avalanche  there is an avalanche in our future  whether it is an overdue stock market crash  on going bond market crash  another massive QE program to levitate markets that leads to a crash in the dollar  wars in Syria  North Korea  or wherever the powers that be choose for 2017 2018

   we expect S P 500 annual nominal total returns to average just 0 6  over the coming 12 year period  even if underlying economic growth accelerates to historically normal rates  
Margin Debt

Margin debt looks dangerously high  similar to conditions before the 2000 crash and 2008 crash 
What about the flamboyant NASDAQ   Log Scale 

The monthly chart shows 25 years of speculation and crash behavior  The NASDAQ looks toppy  Watch out below 

The weekly NASDAQ Composite has accelerated higher   from about 4 600 to 6 000 in ten months  Look out below

195396,416912,SCHW,The Free Lunch Of Diversification  Still On The Menu,opinion,"Anthony Davidow  vice president  alternative beta and asset allocation strategist  Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW   offers a valuable re examination of modern portfolio theory in an article for Investments   Wealth Monitor 
Davidow begins at the beginning  Harry Markowitz called diversification  the only free lunch in finance   The idea is that by diversifying  an investor gets a benefit  reduced risk  at no loss in returns  Markowitz  work expounding that notion won him a Nobel Prize and laid the foundations for MPT 
Unfortunately  correlations have increased since Markowitz  mid 20th century flash of insight  Geographic correlation in particular has increased and this has restricted the nutritional value of that free lunch  In other words  MPT notwithstanding  one might reasonably ask why one should allocate outside of the United States 
That is the question Davidow sets out to answer in the essay titled 
Answers Quick and Slow
One quick answer  one wants to allocate outside the U S  because the U S  isn t just now where the growth is  Davidow cites the International Monetary Fund   at just 2 3   but the growth of emerging and developing countries  economies at 4 5  
Speaking more broadly  to refine this answer a bit   Davidow says that there is a  natural rotation of the best and worst performing asset classes on a year to year basis   U S  large capitalized companies  as indexed by the S P 500  performed near the top in the period 2013 2015  emerging markets were near the bottom then  By 2016  though  the emerging markets were performing more strongly  and the valuations of the S P 500 companies were  getting stretched   which is what makes the IMF projections for 2017 plausible 
 Investors   Davidow infers   would benefit from exposure to emerging markets but likely would be uncomfortable with a large allocation to this volatile asset class  
A Refined Understanding of the Free Lunch
In general  then  Davidow believes Markowitz  insight remains valuable  The  free lunch  has become a bit skimpier  but it remains folly to turn it down  Even  during periods of market stress   he writes  although in such periods correlations do increase  as everyone heads to the same safe havens  out the same exits from the not so safe havens  correlation is not perfect  it does not go to 1  so diversification remains valuable 
The best response to the new more interconnected world then is not to erase MPT from the chalkboard altogether  but to acknowledge that  asset allocation strategies can be dynamic   both in choosing which asset classes to include and in making tactical adjustments to reflect short or long term changes in the market or macroeconomic environment  
As a very simple instance of diversification Davidow presents a chart showing the fate of  100 000 invested at the beginning of this millennium in either of three distinct portfolios  If all of that money had gone into the S P 500  it would now be worth  230 437  If it had all gone into a blend of 60  stock  40  bonds  it would have done somewhat better  and it would now be worth  233 818  If it had gone into a fully diversified portfolio  as defined by Morningstar Direct and Schwab Center for Financial Research  reflecting a range in geographical regions  capitalization size  liquidity of asset  etc   it would now be worth  280 609 
Of course  past performance is no indicator of future results   Still  what past performance does reveal is precisely that diversification can buffer shocks  In the brief period of the performance of those three hypothetical portfolios  there were two great market shocks  the dotcom bubble burst and related phenomena  the  tech wreck   at the beginning of the period and the Great Recession in the middle 
The free lunch consists of the ability of the more diversified portfolio to cushion such shocks  and over time to recoup losses and grow 
The Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  Survey
Another recent release  one which displays some synergy with Davidow s discussion  is the Deutsche Bank s 15th annual Alternative Investment Survey  Deutsche Bank s release quotes Marlin Naidoo  their Americas Head of Hedge Fund Consulting  saying that more investors than ever are allocating to the hedge fund space  and speaking of the proliferation of strategies and products in ways that Markowitz might appreciate 
 The number of strategies available has been growing and now range from simple low fee alternative risk premia products to more complex high alpha products that have seen further enhancements due to advances in areas such as machine learning  quantum computing  and the cloud  
All that should help in ordering up the free lunch of diversification ",2017-03-29,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-free-lunch-of-diversification:-still-on-the-menu-200180508,200180508

195399,416915,SCHW,Markets Rally As Expected  Now What  ,opinion,"Market Rallies As Expected
In last weekend s newsletter  I suggested the markets could rally this week with some very specific caveats  Let s review where we are   All charts updated through Friday  

 The market  via S P 500  has now tripped the first signal as shown above  and below  sending a warning that further weakness could ensue  With the first signal registered  combined with a break of the 50 dma  we are now on  a signal 1 alert   



 With portfolios already hedged  as we added a lot of bond and interest rate sensitive holdings back in January  there is no action to take currently  This is why  for now  it is only an  alert  that something more important is developing 


IMPORTANT  By the time weekly signals are issued on an intermediate term basis  the market is generally oversold  with  bearish  sentiment increasing  on a short term  daily  basis  Given those short term conditions  it is quite likely the markets will rally next week  


As expected the market did rally last week  As I noted it would be the success or failure of the rally attempt which would dictate what happens next  
 If the market can reverse course next week  and move back above the 50 dma AND break the declining price trend from the March highs  then an attempt at all time highs is quite likely   Probability Guess   30  
However  a rally back to the 50 dma that fails will likely result in a continuation of the correction to the 200 dma as seen previously  From current levels that would suggest a roughly  5  drawdown  However  as shown below  those drawdowns under similar conditions could approach  15    Probability Guess   70   

As of Friday  the market failed at resistance closing below the 50 dma for the week  As denoted by the red dashed lines  the current price action of the market being compressed within a downtrend  

A  breakout  will likely occur next week which will fulfill one of the two potential outcomes noted above  

Second Warning Rising
The recent deterioration in the market is also threatening to trigger the second  sell signal  alert  Previously  such signals  particularly from high levels  have warned of deeper market corrections with this time likely not be much different  

IMPORTANT  This does NOT mean liquidating into cash  The signal is CLOSE to being triggered BUT a strong rally next week would negate such an event keeping portfolios more heavily allocated towards equity risk  Nonetheless  this is certainly not a time to be overly complacent in portfolio allocations either  
As I noted last week  The SECOND signal  when it is fully triggered  would reduce equity related portfolio allocations to 75  of target levels 

From a portfolio management perspective  it is never wise to make aggressive adjustments to allocations  By taking a measured approach  and monitoring outcomes  portfolio risk can be adjusted to changing market trends 
The advantage of this  ratcheting  approach keeps emotional biases somewhat in check  When individuals make big adjustments in one direction or another  it can become emotionally difficult to reverse such a decision  Investors tend to start rationalizing previous decisions rather than recognizing their mistake and quickly remedying the situation  However  by making small calculated moves  it is much easier to reallocate risk accordingly as market dynamics change  
As discussed last week  the follow guidelines should be sufficient in adjusting weightings and rebalancing overall portfolio risk 
Portfolio Action Guidelines
Given this is only a  warning signal  currently  any RALLY in the next week should be used to take some action within portfolios  The following list provides some basic guidelines 
Trimming back winning positions to original portfolio weights  Investment Rule  Let Winners Run
Sell positions that simply are not working  if the position was not working in a rising market  it likely won t in a declining market   Investment Rule  Cut Losers Short
Hold the cash raised from these activities until the next buying opportunity occurs  Investment Rule  Buy Low

These actions will temporarily reduce portfolio risk and raise cash levels which either provides a  hedge  against a subsequent downturn OR cash to buy better performing assets if conditions improve 

For now  the market remains in a bullish trend  Outside of small tweaks and close monitoring  nothing has occurred  yet  which would warrant more drastic movements within the allocation model 
Caution  nothing more  is advised for now  
It s Up To Congress
This past Thursday  the market rallied sharply on the back of some  top notch jawboning  from the newly minted Treasury Secretary  Steve Mnuchin when he stated on CNBC 

 The Trump administration is close to bringing forward major tax reform  and will unveil a plan very soon  

Despite a complete lack of details  the markets rallied on  hope  once again  After all  it is the  tax cut reform  bill that is almost entirely behind the optimistic outlook for earnings per share climbing sharply by 2018 to justify current valuations 
However  there are a few hurdles Congressional Republicans will have to deal with as they return to Capitol Hill next week 
First  the  debt ceiling  will be hit on April 28th which will need to be immediately addressed  As I  with  former Freedom Caucus  member Congressman Ted Poe  it is likely Congress will immediately pass a  One Week Continuing Resolution  in order to buy time needed to negotiate a  CR  for the rest of the 2017 fiscal year through August 
However  as Congressman Poe points out  this negotiation will likely come at a  cost  of funding previous ACA requirements and  Planned Parenthood  which many Congressional Republicans strongly oppose  Also  the issues of  border wall funding  and  immigration  specifically related to the funding of the  deportation task force   
In other words  there is a risk that a one week CR turns into a full blown CR as both sides clash over opposing views  Such an outcome will be a significant headwind for the financial markets as the  sequence  of events that need to occur to get to the  promised land  of tax cuts begins to back up 
Debt Ceiling needs to be raised to allow for continuing Governmental operations BEFORE
Healthcare  repeal and replace  bill can be passed next to resolve the imputed tax liabilities and costs which must be done BEFORE
Tax cut reform bill can be passed to resolve budgetary  revenue  issues BEFORE
Infrastructure spending can be passed 
The reason I say this sequence of events is a potential problem is because there is an EXTREMELY high level of disappointment that can occur EVEN if Congress passes bills approving all of the legislative items above 
Just because Congress approves bills  where they have a healthier voting margin over Democrats  there is only a one vote majority in the Senate  With a 60 vote requirement in the Senate it is likely that many of these bills will either never pass the Senate  OR will become extremely watered down versions of their original forms 
Bluntly speaking   the possibilities of  repealing and replacing  healthcare with a  really great health care plan   significant  tax reform cuts  and  infrastructure spending  realistically have very low odds over the next 12 months given the variety of factions within the Republican party  
I agree with Cowen s Chris Kruger 

 White House s misconception they have any leverage with Democrats when it s the opposite  as Congressional Democrats have less than zero incentive to compromise with Trump and Trump needs them to keep govt from shutting down  

This puts the financial markets  which are currently remaining elevated on  hopes  of significant reform at risk of significant potential  repricing risk  in the future 
Having a little  dry powder  makes some sense over the next month until the path forward  or not  becomes more evident 
The Last Time
 made a very interesting observation on Friday 

 A few days ago Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW   the investment brokerage firm  announced that the number of new brokerage accounts soared 44  during the first quarter of 2017 
More specifically  Schwab stated that individual investors are opening up stock trading accounts at the fastest pace the company has seen in 17 years  

Hmm remember what happened 17 years ago 


 Investors are once again clamoring to buy expensive  popular stocks at price levels never before seen in the history of the stock market 
At 26 44  the S P 500 s Price Earnings ratio is the highest EVER  except for two occasions  the 2008 crash  and the 2000 crash 
At 28 93  the  Shiller P E ratio   which looks at company valuations over a longer term  10 year period and adjusts for inflation  is at the highest level EVER  except for two occasions  the 2000 crash  and the 1929 crash 
Price to sales ratios are near the highest levels in at least 50 years 
Price to book ratios haven t been at this level since the 2008 crash 
And the stock market cap to GDP ratio is the highest since the 2000 crash  

While such a data point doesn t mean the markets are set to crash tomorrow  it is certainly worth considering the  risk  being undertaken to achieve potentially very limited  rewards  from current levels 
Market   Sector Analysis
Data Analysis Of The Market   Sectors For Traders
S P 500 Tear Sheet
The  Tear Sheet  below is a  reference sheet  provide some historical context to markets  sectors  etc  and looking for deviations from historical extremes 
If you have any suggestions or additions you would like to see  send me an email 

Sector Analysis
The slow motion correction that began back in March continued again this past week  with the market rallying  as expected last week  but failing at the 50 dma as resistance builds  This also triggered a weekly sell signal as discussed above  and potentially a secondary weekly  sell  signal as well  The markets must significantly gain traction next week if a deeper correction is to be avoided for now  
In January of this year  I discussed how the various sectors of the market  rotate  over time  To wit 

 The video below shows the historical  rotation  of sectors over the last 3 years  As you will notice sectors have consistently  swarmed  in a clockwise rotation going from strongly outperforming the S P 500 index to strongly underperforming  If you watch to the end of the video you will see the post presidential election anomaly form  


I have notated the changes on the Sector Rotation model below  In January  the set up for a rotation  following the November election was apparent  It was at that time that we began to overweight bonds  utilities  and REITs in portfolios DESPITE the calls from the media that rates had  nowhere to go but up because of the Fed   
Four months later  we have now lightened up on that trade a bit  but still remain primarily long the improving and leading sectors 

Remain cautious currently as the  Trump Trade  has continued to weaken over the last week 

Despite the ongoing struggles with the  retail sector   Discretionary  via Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLY   stocks bounced off their 50 dma last week to maintain its bullish bias  However  that surge also pushed the sector back into overbought status 
Technology  Technology Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLK    Industrials  Industrial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLI    and Materials  Materials Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLB   sectors continue to struggle with their respective 50 day moving averages  While still trending positively  relative performance has weakened substantially for now 
Energy  Energy Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLE   continues to struggle after breaking its 50 dma and broke its 200 dma two weeks  While energy had a bit of a bounce last week  and tested resistance at the 50 dma  the bounce failed and the trend continues to materially weaken  Energy is very close to a major sector sell signal  Remain heavily underweight energy for the time being  
Healthcare  Health Care Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLV   and Financials  Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF   have broken their 50 dma  Underweight these sectors for now 
Bonds  iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT    Utilities  Utilities Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLU    and Staples  Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLP   all continue to be the clear winners  which we were discussing back in January  as the Trump Trade was going to reverse  Those hedges have continued to perform well despite the weakness in other areas of the market  We did take profits last week in some of our holdings  

Small and Mid Cap stocks continued to weaken in terms of relative performance and have broken their respective 50 dma s  The deterioration of relative strength continues to suggest caution 
Emerging Markets  via iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  NYSE EEM    International  via iShares MSCI EAFE  NYSE EFA    and Dividend Yielding Stocks  via iShares International Select Dividend  NYSE IDV  and SPDR S P Dividend  NYSE SDY   are also showing weakness but remain in a bullish trend currently  Some profit taking and rebalancing is advised 
Bonds and REIT s  via Vanguard REIT  NYSE VNQ   currently overbought and some profit taking is advised  If the broader markets can rally over the next week or two  simply due to a reflexive oversold condition  look for these sectors to pull back to provide a better entry point 
The table below shows thoughts on specific actions related to the current market environment  
 These are not recommendations or solicitations to take any action  This is for informational purposes only related to market extremes and contrarian positioning within portfolios  Use at your own risk and peril  

Portfolio Update 
After hedging our long equity positions 18 weeks ago with deeply out of favor sectors of the market  Bonds  REITs  Staples  Utilities  Health Care and Staples  we did rebalance some of our long term CORE equity holdings back to original portfolio weightings harvesting a bit of liquidity  
While the bullish trend is still positive  which keeps us allocated on the long side of the market  the weekly  sell signal  alert is not being dismissed  As I penned here last week 

 Any rally next week that  fails  to put the market back on more solid footing will be used to reduce risk in portfolios to some degree and rebalance back to target weightings  

We did raise some cash last week out of overbought sectors  and are waiting to see if the markets can regain some strenth this coming week as noted above 
We are still maintaining hedges until the current corrective action completes  Furthermore  we are currently maintaining  new money  in short term cash positions and only selectively stepping into core long term holdings with tight stop loss levels  
We continue to maintain very tight trailing stops as the mid to longer term dynamics of the market continue to remain very unfavorable ",2017-04-23,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-rally-as-expected…now-what-–-04-21-17-200184426,200184426
195402,416918,SCHW,Taking The Temperature Of REIT ETFs,opinion,"ETF investors are likely measuring the resilience and relative performance of their portfolios during the latest 6 month jump in interest rates  Bond funds are the obvious areas of concern in terms of volatility  However  many stock and equity income asset classes maintain a high sensitivity to Treasury yield fluctuations as well 
REITs certainly fall into this category and are one of the few sectors of the market currently trading well off their highs  As I wrote in September  inflection points in interest rates typically signal a change of trend for these assets 
Looking at a chart of the Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  US REIT  NYSE SCHH   it s clear that we have now seen a notable correction from the July peak followed by stabilizing price action  The chart patterns continue to demonstrate successive higher highs and higher lows since the November bottom  This type of price action appears to be quite healthy in the near term and is why I am turning favorable on this sector to start 2017 

SCHH tracks over 100 U S  publicly traded real estate investment trusts in a market cap weighted structure  This index represents a solid benchmark of the REIT sector for a minimal expense of just 0 07  annually  It also currently sports a 30 day SEC yield of 2 80   with dividends paid quarterly to shareholders 
We recently added this position as a tactical holding for subscribers to the   The resurgence in price  coupled with the strong dividend yield  and access to an alternative income producing sector were the primary considerations for this decision  Overall  SCHH represents a small portion of the diversified portfolio and will need to maintain its technical strength to remain part of the mix 
Turning to the international front  the Vanguard Global ex US Real Estate  NASDAQ VNQI  has demonstrated similar price action to its domestic peers  This index represents nearly 700 investable real estate stocks in both developed and emerging markets outside the United States 

The most pressing concern for overseas investments has been the strength of the U S  dollar over the last six months  see bottom of chart   This factor acts as a fundamental headwind to traditional unhedged international funds like VNQI  If we start to see a resurgence in foreign currency prices during 2017  it could help buoy international REITs substantially 
The Bottom Line
In my opinion  REIT ETFs can offer many benefits within the context of a diversified growth or income portfolio  They sport generous yields  are low cost  and offer a varying risk dynamic than traditional stocks or bonds  Nevertheless  they should be owned in moderation and are susceptible to both interest rate and broad market volatility  That is why investors should closely evaluate their REIT exposure to ensure their current allocation is in line with their risk tolerance

195417,416933,SCHW,The Fed Has Spoken And The Almighty Dollar Remains Range Bound,opinion,"The long anticipated Fed meeting in September has now come and gone  and not much has changed  especially with respect to the positioning of the U S  dollar versus its major pairing partners  The official statement from the Federal Open Market Committee had the familiar ring of caution   The committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided  for the time being  to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives   Stocks initially rallied at the thought of more accommodation  but soon gave up their temporary gains  The USD Index weakened a bit on the news  but it  too  regained lost ground  sticking to its tight range 
For this time around  however  the committee seemed divided in its judgment of the current situation  Janet Yellen has been praised in the past for her ability to corral disparate opinions from her banking buddies and to appear to be a united front when it came to Fed policy pronouncements  The so called  hawkish  block of Esther George  Loretta Mester and Eric Rosengren actually dissented from the statement  choosing to vote  No  and signaling that a December rate hike may be a sure thing  As much as the Fed likes to claim that politics do not influence their decisions  waiting another three months would delay action until after the most contentious presidential race in history 
Analysts were quick to pick up the dropped baton  Kathy Jones  chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW   waxed eloquently that   The solid coalition is still going to be there with Yellen   William  Dudley   Stanley  Fischer and a handful of others  I think they re still all in agreement  I can only surmise there s a division between those who think that we are in this secular stagnation world   slow growth for a longer time   vs  those who think it s a cyclical issue that s taking a very long time to play out   The outcome of the meeting was not a surprise  The committee met expectations 
The committee wanted to make clear that they did observe favorable signs in the economy by adding these descriptive sentences to their narrative 
   The labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year     Although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months  job gains have been solid  on average     Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed income has remained soft    Inflation targets will be hit  as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further  
In the past  the Fed had expressed concern over global economic issues  but their recent statement barely touched upon the impacts of Brexit or ongoing slowdowns in China  They did  however  soften their forecast of rate hikes in the future  more in line with what recent surveys have predicted  The committee now sees  two hikes in 2017 and three each in 2018 and 2019 that would bring the funds rate to about 2 625 percent  assuming that each increase would come in quarter point increments  
As for the U S  economy  they downgraded GDP growth for 2016 to 1 8   a tad lower than the previous 2  forecast  Inflation estimates also fell from 1 4  to 1 3   well below the accepted target of 2   At her press conference  Yellen remarked   Our decision does not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy  The committee agrees that risks to the outlook have become roughly balanced   She added that the need for more gradual changes in interest rates going forward was to prevent the economy from  overheating   and she rebuked the criticism coming from conservatives by saying   We do not discuss politics at our meetings  and we do not take politics into account in our decisions  
Why did the Dollar choose to go nowhere fast 
The probability of a September rate hike  as inferred from the futures markets  had been declining from 34   as the date of the 21st approached  Although many Fed members had spoken of a potential adjustment on their respective speaking tours  the vast majority of analysts and pundits had surmised that the Fed did not want to rock the economic boat before the November elections  Roiling the financial markets would play into the hands of conservatives and unduly influence the voting public  or so goes conventional wisdom on this topic  regardless of Yellen s protestations 
As for the dollar  it has been stuck within a tight range for months  as this chart reveals tvx

This daily chart goes back to May  the endpoint for the previous downward channel that prevailed for the first part of the year  The USD had just come off a tremendous uptrend since 2014 when it was apparent that the Fed s monetary policy would be the first to diverge from the pack  The dollar s historic rise from an index perspective witnessed a rise from 78 9 in May of 2014 to 100 7 a year later  It declined from there  waiting for action from the Fed  which came in December  Four adjustments were forecast for 2016  but  when it became obvious that the Fed would not follow through on its plan  the Dollar took a hit down to 92 0 before resuming a gradual rise to a 95 0 midpoint average 
The heavy dark blue line reflects the anticipation that was building that the Fed would actually make a September and a December quarter point hike in its benchmark rate  but you could easily add a descending line August forward to represent the formation of a symmetrical triangle  This triangle suggests that a new December decision point would be the next positioning for a major move in pricing behavior  It remains to be seen if the index stays within its tight 95 ish corridor  The upcoming election will surely generate a level of volatility until market uncertainty recedes  In the meantime  growth and monetary divergence risks will rule the day 
For the time being  we sit and ponder at the 95 level  Technical indicators currently display a negative bias for the near term  As long as interest rates from other major jurisdictions hover in negative territory  the greenback will still offer the best overall yields on a comparative basis  When one fundamental offsets another technical bias  the market s result is often to stand still  Another calm is developing before an eventual storm  but the source and timing of the storm clouds remain up for speculation 
What are major banking departments forecasting for the USD Index at yearend 
2016 was supposed to be a rather boring year  when it came to forecasting foreign exchanges rates  Major bank forex departments had reached consensus early that monetary policy divergence would drive rate changes to be determined by how and when a series of Fed interest rate adjustments would roll out  The Brexit referendum was not even on the radar at the time  Commodities were in a five year long downdraft  but most indications were that they would recover  albeit gradually  China was a concern  but Chinese officials had already developed a reputation for intervention when it was called for 
As the year rolled out  any Fed adjustments became suspect  Brexit happened  Europe and China dragged along  while Japan remained Japan  frozen in place for nearly two decades  As a result  forex departments have made many changes to their best guesstimates  Here is the latest table of changes from now until the end of the year 
The consensus now is that the USD will appreciate some 4 3  versus these major pairings  driving the index to something between 99 and 100 on that scale  At the start of the year  110 was the upward estimate  but it was predicated on a more aggressive Fed  Central bankers have been cautious for good reasons  and remain so  Near zero and negative interest rate policies have allowed capital to seep into areas that cannot afford higher interest rates  Carry trade volume is perilously close to the  12 trillion mark  If interest rates are raised too high too quickly  then a global unraveling of monstrous proportions could take place  creating the much feared liquidity crunch across the globe 
If there was to be higher volatility following the summer break  the bounce has been weak  We are once again sitting on a precipice  waiting for the Fed to take action  waiting to discover who the next President of the United States will be  and waiting for all economies to pick up the pace in the last quarter  Historically  October has not been a great month  if a calm month receives low ratings  One good volatility spike has occurred each October for the past few years  so we can wait for that event risk  too 
Are all currencies weak at this moment 
Major currencies may be reeling versus the USD  but there is one currency that has not   Gold  Since the Great Recession  we have witnessed the great debasement of paper money versus the oldest currency used by man  Since last December  the rally in Gold prices has drawn little in the way of press coverage  yet it rocketed from  1 046 an ounce to  1 380 in July  a nice 32  jump in appreciation  It has pulled back to the  1 340 level and held a tight range for the last three months 
Central bankers rarely talk about Gold  but  as one analyst puts it   Central banks around the world hold gold as part of their foreign currency reserves  In the U S  and Europe  the importance of the yellow metal emanates from the fact that over 70  of total foreign exchange reserves are in gold  Central banks and monetary authorities rarely discuss gold  it is almost a taboo topic  The reason for this is that governments cannot print more gold  they can only buy or sell the metal  
Concluding Remarks
The Dollar Index is stuck in neutral again  biding its time in the mid nineties  until conditions change  Bankers seem dead certain that the Fed will act in December  as it did a year ago  the reason for their appreciation scenarios going forward  There are  however  a number of moving parts in this drama  any of which could derail these rather conservative projections 
The Presidential election could render all of these forecasts both null and void  A softening in the U S  economy  another fall in oil prices  or problems in Europe or China could also make the Fed reconsider  actions that would send the Dollar gasping for 92 and beyond  For now  the majority sees a 100 value by year end  but the herd is often wrong  Stay cautious 
 Risk Statement  Trading Foreign Exchange on margin carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors  The possibility exists that you could lose more than your initial deposit  The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you

195418,416934,SCHW,How Retirement Saving Rules Are Making ETFs More Attractive,opinion,"Earlier this week  BlackRock  the world s largest money manager  announced fees cut on 15 iShares core ETFs across US equity  fixed income and international equity asset classes   The expense on the iShares Core S P 500 ETF    is now just 4 basis points  making it cheaper than the other two ultra popular ETFs tracking the same index SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY     and Vanguard S P 500 ETF    
	The move came ahead of the implementation of the Labor Department s new fiduciary rule  which will require financial advisors to work in the  best interest of their clients when selling retirement products  These rules  set to be implemented in April next year  will make it difficult for advisors to recommend actively managed mutual funds to retirees    Read   
	Not only most of the actively managed funds are much more expensive than passively managed broad market ETFs  they have also underperformed passively managed funds for the past many years  It is expected that the rule could  into passive managed products  Low cost ETFs tracking broad market indexes will be the biggest beneficiary of this move   Read   
	 Institutions  individuals  and financial advisors are increasingly putting low cost ETFs at the center of their long term investments  Now  with the Department of Labor  DoL  fiduciary rule coming into force  financial advisors are sharpening their focus on the quality and cost efficiency of funds  BlackRock expects these advisors will use ETFs more and more as active tools and alongside high conviction active funds to build better portfolios for clients  We also expect financial advisors will increasingly turn to core ETFs for long term holdings  where value matters most   per BlackRock press release 
	The price war between large ETF providers has escalated of late  Vanguard  which is the low cost leader in the ETF industry  saw largest inflows between January and August this year  They attracted  55 9 billion in net new inflows in the US  while BlackRock s iShares gathered  53 9 billion and State Street Global Advisors had only  16 6 billion in inflows  per FT 
	This morning Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  announced expense ratio cut for five of their popular ETFs  I would not be surprised to see similar moves by other major ETF providers as the competition for attracting price sensitive customer inflows intensifies  And  there is no doubt that investors are the biggest winners in this fee war

Why Investment Broker Stocks Might Be a Good Bet Now

Speculation over the timing of rate hike continues to influence market sentiments with the nearing of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting  While the final move by the Fed at its two day policy meeting  Sep 20 21  remains a key area to watch  recent speeches by several Fed officials reflect a divided stance 

On Monday  at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs  Fed Governor Lael Brainard s comments reflected a cautionary note  She stated   My main point here is that in the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures  it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the possibility of making further gains in the labor market   Throwing light on the global concerns  she further added   Headwinds from abroad should matter to U S  policymakers because recent experience suggests global financial markets are tightly integrated  such that disturbances emanating from Chinese or euro area financial markets quickly spill over to U S  financial markets  
	Among other officials  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari feels that there is no immediate need of a rate hike  while Governor Daniel Tarullo seeks more evidence of rise in inflation before considering a hike 
	However  on Friday  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren had hawkish tone  He said   My personal view  based on data that we have received to date  is that a reasonable case can be made for continuing to pursue a gradual normalization of monetary policy   He added   if we want to ensure that we remain at full employment  gradual tightening is likely to be appropriate   Other officials whose recent comments reflected a support for rate hike include Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Federal Reserve Bank President of Richmond Jeffrey Lacker 
	While mixed opinions are currently ruling the market  we believe several issues including the Brexit induced uncertainties  U S  dollar appreciation and the upcoming Presidential election might cause further delay in rate hike  Nevertheless  the continued positive domestic economic factors such as a recovery in job market and increased household spending certainly increase the odds of a hike by the end of this year 
	As a rising rate environment boosts the performance of certain industries and hurts others  it is now time for the investors to re adjust their investment portfolios  The investment brokerage space typically benefits from a rising rate environment  so it could be a good industry to explore for picking stocks now Why Eye Brokerage Space 
	Currently  out of more than 260 industries on our radar  the Investment Brokerage space has a  of 76  Top 30    Amid the unpredictable market conditions  it is important to consider the performance of an industry  This is because  more often than not  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that can boost securities across the board  In fact  studies have shown that an average stock in a strong industry is likely to outperform a great stock in a poor industry 
	With a rise in rates  brokerages firms are likely to engage in more investment activities  Investment brokers earn interest income on un invested cash in client accounts  Therefore  when rates increase  they can invest this cash at higher rates  thereby leading to a rise in interest income 
	Brokerage firms like E TRADE Financial Corp     derive nearly 60  of their total revenue from interest income  Another major brokerage house that stand to benefit is TD Ameritrade Holding Corp       as its business is largely tied with receiving interest on cash which is highly sensitive to short term rates 

Further  the low rate environment had forced several firms like The Charles Schwab Corp  NYSE SCHW       to waive fees in order to maintain positive return for clients  However  the rising rate environment would reverse the trend

195448,416964,SCHW,Stocks Finish Fairly Flat,opinion,"U S  equities closed the regular session lower  but near the flatline as some decent strength in materials issues was unable to influence stocks higher with health care and consumer discretionary listings lagging  Treasuries were mixed and little changed following an unexpected slip in Markit s preliminary U S  manufacturing report  The U S  dollar was mostly flat and gold and crude oil prices ticked lower 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  declined 8 points to 17 493  the S P 500 Index decreased 4 points  0 2   to 2 048  and the Nasdaq Composite lost 4 points  0 1   to 4 766  In moderately heavy volume  804 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 9 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq  WTI crude oil ticked  0 33 lower to  48 08 per barrel  wholesale gasoline was unchanged at  1 64 per gallon  and the Bloomberg gold spot price lost  2 23 to  1 252 52 per ounce  Elsewhere  the Dollar Index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was nearly unchanged at 95 26 
Bayer AG  DE BAYGN   OTC BAYRY  95  announced that it has made an offer to acquire Monsanto Co   NYSE MON   MON  106  for  122 per share in cash  valued at about  62 billion  Bayer said it is fully committed to pursuing the transaction and is prepared to proceed immediately to due diligence and negotiations and to quickly agree to a transaction  The company also added that it expects the acquisition to be accretive to core earnings per share  EPS  by a double digit percentage after the first full year  MON did not comment on the announcement  MON traded nicely higher 
Markit s preliminary May manufacturing report unexpectedly dips
The preliminary Markit U S  Manufacturing PMI Index for May dipped to 50 5 from April s 50 8 level  and below the modest increase to 51 0 that economists surveyed by Bloomberg were forecasting  though a reading above 50 denotes expansion in activity 
The report kicks off the week s U S  economic front  which will bring other key releases of new home sales  preliminary durable goods orders  the second look  of three  at 1Q GDP  and the final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index  However  the attention of the global markets will likely remain on the Fed  with another plethora of officials set to speak  including a speech from Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Friday 
The Fed appears stuck  as the economy has recovered  employment has improved  housing has bounced back  and asset prices have appreciated  However  the economy is still not firing on all cylinders  We expect economic activity to pick up in the second quarter from the weak first quarter  but whether it will be enough to allow the Fed to raise rates again  it s too soon to tell 
Treasuries were mixed  with the yield on the 2 year note rising 2 basis points  bps  to 0 90   while the yield on the 10 year note declined 1 bp to 1 83  and the 30 year bond rate was flat at 2 63   Bond yields have jumped as of late amid resurfaced Fed rate hike expectations in the wake of some hawkish commentary from Central Bank officials and the April monetary policy meeting minutes which showed the possibility of a June rate hike has not been ruled out 
Tomorrow  the U S  economic calendar will include the aforementioned housing data in the form of new home sales for April  expected to show a 2 3  increase to an annual rate of 523 000 units  Also  some regional data will take shape with the release of the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index for May  forecasted to decline to 8 from the prior month s level of 14  but a reading above 0 denotes expansion in activity 
Europe mostly lower and Asia mixed as Fed continues to command attention European equities traded mostly lower  as the global markets continued to grapple with the possibility of a near term rate hike by the Fed  while oil and gas issues saw some pressure amid the weakness in crude oil prices  Basic materials stocks also weighed on the markets  In economic news  the preliminary Markit Eurozone Composite PMI Index a gauge of business activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors dipped to 52 9 in May from 53 0 in April  compared to the expected rise to 53 2  However  a reading above 50 denotes expansion  while growth in French services sector activity unexpectedly accelerated and German business activity came in stronger than expected  Moreover  festering concerns about the possibility of a U K  exit from the EU  known as a Brexit  remain  The euro and the British pound lost ground versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region were mixed 
Stocks in Asia finished mixed with the global markets remaining focused on the potential for a summer rate hike out of the U S   while lower oil prices weighed on the energy sector  Japanese equities declined  with the yen strengthening to pressure sentiment on the heels of this weekend s G 7 meeting between world finance chiefs in Japan  which delivered little major developments but focus was on the apparent disagreement regarding foreign exchange policy  Japan reported an unexpected widening of its April trade surplus as exports fell slightly more than expected  while imports dropped by a larger amount than projected  Stocks in mainland China finished higher  while those trading in Hong Kong declined  Australian securities decreased amid weakness in oil and gas issues  which was met with declines in financials and basic materials stocks  Finally  Indian stocks traded lower on the festering uncertainty regarding a potential Fed rate hike and South Korean equities moved higher 
The international economic docket for tomorrow will include the release of the Leading Index from China  1Q GDP and the Zew Economic Sentiment Survey from Germany  manufacturing and business confidence from France and public sector borrowing from the U K

195467,416983,SCHW,It Was Never About Oil,opinion,"The link between stock prices and oil has been especially high of late  and that has left quite a few traders and experts stumped  For a good long while any impact from oil was denied as only  transitory  or even helpful to consumers through some sort of  tax cut  effect  In January 2016  however  liquidations appeared regularly in one alongside the other  This is was not supposed to occur  From last month 

 Absent an economic recession  stocks have fallen too far in my mind as a long term investor   says John Buckingham  who manages about  600 million as chief investment officer of Al Frank Asset Management 
 It s a big move  and the sentiment in crude is driving pretty much all asset classes right now   said Brett Mock  managing director at brokerage JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC 

Again today  stocks sold precipitously  in the morning  while oil crashed  as if there might be some common monetary theme behind all the liquidation efforts  It has left even the most veteran stock watchers as reluctant petroleum analysts still wondering why so much crude supply could be so devastating 

 It s the oil tail wagging the market dog    said Art Hogan  chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities 

That has left the  market  seemingly in desperation for the Fed to come back and save stocks as so many believed had happened before 

 There could be some growing optimism ahead of Janet Yellen s testimony  She has in the past had the ability to push markets higher  although that s diminished in recent years   said Randy Frederick  managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab  N SCHW  

It s a nice fairy tale  but the very fact that stocks and oil are where they are suggests the Fed hasn t been effective at all  particularly since all anyone will talk about is a looming recession contradicting everything monetary policy has described or promised  In fact  the entire idea of the  Greenspan  put  updated from Bernanke to Yellen  never materialized  When needed  when the market was most pressed  the Fed failed   spectacularly  And 2008 was not the first as this century has already witnessed just 15 years in two 60  declines in stocks  for the S P 500  worse in other segments indices  
What clouds the issue of monetarism is the difference between them  The dot com bust was just as severe and in many ways more painful  the Chinese torture of slow erosion of the first versus the much faster and immediately violent crash of the most recent  but there was no great recession with it  only mild economic discomfort  Alan Greenspan and his committee of the orthodox faithful had been given a lot of credit for  guiding  the economy through that period with minimal damage  The fact that it was  achieved  via a massive housing bubble was only later appended to the narrative as if still a backhanded acknowledgement of monetary power and authority 
Even that still gives the Federal Reserve and monetary policy too much credit  We know this for sure because both Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke told us  and contemporarily  In Greenspan s words it was a  conundrum  while Bernanke posited a  global savings glut   Both are the same interpretation of a monetary system far out of alignment with not just economics but even central bank policy  The context of both those ridiculous theories holds the dispostive interpretation   the FOMC was attempting to  tighten  monetary policy but the  conundrum  and  global savings glut  showed that the true monetary system was having none of it 
The relationship of money to economy is supposed to be robust and highly conducive as a tool for increasing efficiency  In the past  the mechanism guiding that relationship was hard money in the form of metal  gold or silver   Economists of the Progressive Age judged that unreliable and proceeded to undo as many hard money constraints as possible   giving us the Great Depression as their first step 

While the Bretton Woods standard had lasted until 1971  in truth it had come undone as early as the late 1950 s  The US  for instance  had actually removed the gold exchange mechanism as early as 1960 in the London Gold Pool  When gold was finally banished officially  ostensibly the dollar was believed its replacement  but it wasn t as if the global stash of  reserves  of physical Federal Reserve Notes were its basis  The dollar system that came to create global trade liquidity and finance was credit based  a distinction that makes all the difference 
Despite that fact  very few seem to stand in appreciation of what it meant then  and fewer still now  The Fed  for one  with its monetarist orthodoxy believes that recession is everywhere unhelpful and thus tries to influence the money supply via a federal funds rate  In the dot com bust and recession  they brought the rate down to as low as 1   and that was almost two years after it was over  Again  that provides another clue as to whether theory matches actual conditions 
The point of recession in the first place is to temporarily deviate in order to remove inefficiency  the necessary pruning of creative destruction  In terms of money supply  under hard money systems that meant actually tighter money conditions where interest rates rose and asset prices fell  These were  like economic recession  true market forces trying to re establish more toward the foundation baseline   to maintain that solid   strong dollar  relationship between money and economy 

In the dot com recession  however  stock prices declined severely but really nothing else did   as if the money supply factor had been unperturbed at all  That wasn t as much of a difference as it might seem  given that as early as 1996 Alan Greenspan was speaking about monetary correlations gone awry  His  irrational exuberance  speech was really about that point  It was the eurodollar standard becoming a fully bloomed parallel banking system as it both supplied funding   dollars   and pushed credit and debt for offshore and now onshore capacities 
The Fed taking no note or concern over the eurodollar at all  aside from M3 calculating  insisted that monetary policy be driven by the consumer inflation rate as translated into economic potential via still the Phillips Curve  Thus  if consumer inflation was low  then current activity was believed at least near enough to economic  potential  no matter the other true factors 

In reality  the active and comprehensive  money supply  was simply exploding   so much so that it barely noticed the dot com bust and therefore produced almost nothing of the recession  It certainly did not signal the usual  tight money  conditions that accompany the more robust relationship with the economic foundation  This was the serial asset bubbles that were really larger than any single expression of them 

The relationship between money supply growth and economy became truly tenuous during the housing mania of the middle 2000s  The reason was simply that asset bubbles  inflation  are highly inefficient and so produce great imbalances in the liquidity and monetary structures that link money to economy  Banks were making money in money dealing activities based solely on the premise that the entire system could and would continue expanding on that insane baseline as if permanent  and if it were ever interrupted by recession  as 2001  then that would be a trivial and temporary deviation 
This was the outlook of not just global banking but monetary policy and orthodox economics  Thinking that consumer inflation supplied all the necessary information about the state of money as it related to economic potential  neither central banks nor economists were prepared for what hit on August 9  2007  and everything thereafter  To monetary policy and economic theory derived from the Phillips Curve  there could not have been  too much money  and the recession should not have been very large at all  In fact  that was the scenario that every single one of their models kept suggesting deeper and deeper into it 

Thus  they were wholly surprised and unprepared for not just the size and scale of deterioration money and economy  but that it could have happened at all  The decrepit recovery thereafter similarly confounds  but it reveals to the awakened monetary sense of the credit based reserve currency a singular truth about the US and global economy  it has shrunk  It s not that the recession in 2008 and 2009 performed that act  but more so that it revealed the destruction in economic potential from the monetary misalignment dating back a long  long time 
We know without doubt that is the case because you can t simply lose 15 million potential workers and suggest anything else  only a shrunken economy would so significantly diminish in labor utilization 



In other words  even though GDP was positive and appearing somewhat like a lackluster recovery during the housing bubble  that was only masking the erosion in economic potential via what Austrian economists call malinvestment   and on a grand scale 
That is why central bankers responded as they did  both in terms of heavy size of intervention and the single goal of them  They thought the GR was just another cycle only far larger  therefore their task was to remove any financial or monetary impediments such that the global economy would find its way back to the 2005 baseline  It never did  nor did any of these trillions in  money printing  create much if any  inflation  which was supposed to be one of the primary mechanisms restoring full growth  as believed by orthodox economists   In fact  no matter what or how insane and ridiculous  central bank policy appears only more and more ineffective as if no matter what they do a larger and more basic dynamic supersedes all of it 
It has left us with an intermittent battle of up  down  up  down  with central banks having to repeat these massive operations over and over  And in the failure of each one they are left wondering what happened 


Through all of them  the economy at most responds temporarily before slumping  unexpectedly  each time  In viewing each episode narrowly as if a contained whole or even just singular factors within them  the big picture of sound money and sound economy can get lost  Focusing too much on the exact nature and structures of growing illiquidity and  deflation   via market crashes and currency disruptions  can have the same effect  In other words  those are just the mechanisms for deeper market forces trying to resolve that primary imbalance that was left unanswered even after the Great Recession and Panic of 2008 

The money supply  for lack of a more appropriate term in the  dollar s  universe  is in the long run converging with the shriveled economic baseline  The immediate problem for our current circumstances is that we don t yet have any idea what that foundation might look like even now  how far is down 
What we do know is that the eurodollar system is failing and we know how it is failing  From negative swap spreads to the shrunken  depressed money and credit curves  they all spell out the death of the current standard  In that sense   death  may be too strong a term since that isn t necessarily the end point  I find it unlikely that the eurodollar can continue as it is  but that isn t impossible if perhaps reduced enough to some rump resource function   Money is via market forces now almost fully stripped of its artificial nature  whatever was left of the pre crisis expectations and orientations  leaving only that bedrock of actual potential for support however desiccated it may be now 
Oil prices  among other indications  suggest perhaps much worse than we would like on that count  As noted yesterday  money markets  too  Whatever ultimately the case  this has never been about oil prices except that they are the most visible and straddling indication between finance and economy  the money supply attempting a rebalancing in reverse of leverage that once dominated everything but no longer can fix to even slightly stable fashion  It is the representation of the structure behind the seeming cyclical ",2016-02-10,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/it-was-never-about-oil-383912,383912

195493,417009,SCHW,Stronger Greenback Hurts Q2 Earnings,opinion,"The Greek crisis and China s issue may have stolen much of the headlines recently  but it is actually the stronger US dollar that is attracting the most attention from American corporations 
In recent months  the dollar has been on a winning streak against a number of other currencies  The expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase short term interest rates this 2015 can be considered as the driving factor that influences US dollar s boost  The Fed s anticipated interest rate hike reflects confidence that the economy of the United States is robust enough to withstand a move toward higher rates 
However  a stronger greenback behaves like a double edged sword  Although the strength in the dollar can be beneficial to consumers in some ways  it can negatively impact the stock prices of huge  multinational corporations 
The increasing dollar can cut into the profits of American multinational companies that sell goods and services abroad in a variety of ways  One of the main issues is that US corporations that operate overseas are paid in a foreign currency  which is why when these companies bring foreign revenues home  the conversion back to the US dollar means the profits are worth less 
Another major issue is that a stronger USD means that the goods and services offered by these American corporations are more expensive for foreign buyers  later on reducing the demand for US products 
According to the analysts from RBC Capital Markets  the dollar s ascent should have the greatest negative impact on profits in the second quarter  Based on the bank s estimates  the strong US currency shaved off 1 9 percent from S P 500 s bottom line in the previous quarter 
The effect of the strong US currency is felt most by large cap stocks that do a lot of business abroad  According to Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  Investment Management s senior vice president and chief investment officer of equities Omar Aguilar   In general  40 percent of earnings from S P 500 companies come from international sources  and hence a strong dollar will be a headwind for those multinational companies with significant business overseas  
Out of the 23 S P 500 companies that reported Q2 earnings  17 have stated the negative effects of the stronger dollar  The increased cost of labor even had more mentions than the issue in Greece and China 
The earnings of a company matter a big deal to stock investors  for this is a key factor that drives the stock price  The ability of a certain company to grow its earnings is what helps the price of stocks to climb higher 
Market participants who wanted to minimize the possible influence of the stronger greenback on their portfolio should consider diversifying and shifting into small cap and mid cap stocks  Furthermore  investors could also diversify by looking at sectors that have more domestic sales ",2015-07-16,MXTrade,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stronger-greenback-hurts-q2-earnings-258572,258572
195513,417029,SCHW,Gold s First Quarter Surprise,opinion,"Recently I visited the breathtaking city of Hong Kong to speak at the seventh annual Mines and Money conference  Asia Pacific s premier event for mining investment deal making and capital raising  During my time in Asia I had the additional privilege of addressing the audience of the Asia Mining Club  alongside my good friend Robert Friedland  Executive Chairman and Founder of Ivanhoe Mines 
The mission of the Asia Mining Club is to promote education among its members  and one way to achieve this is by hearing from experts in the financial markets  notably those focused on resources and commodities  During the club s sell out event  I too  confirmed a great deal about the commodity  buzz  on that side of the world  especially on Gold 
The demand for the precious metal in Asia is truly phenomenal  In smaller countries like Indonesia  Thailand and Vietnam  consumption of gold totaled 300 tonnes in 2013  and according to Bloomberg  in 2014 mainland Chinese buyers purchased a total of 125 tonnes in February  including scrap   This number tops the 102 6 tonnes purchased in January and 97 1 tonnes purchased a year ago 
As I wrote about in February  Switzerland plays a role in the movement of physical gold into Asia as well  Home to many of the big gold refiners  Switzerland released monthly gold trade data this year for the first time in over 30 years  with the report showing that 80 percent of shipments went straight into Asia  If we continue to see these large movements of the physical metal  especially from the West to the East  it s only a matter of time until these supply and demand factors lift the gold price 
I often say there are two sides to the gold equation  the Love Trade and the Fear Trade  While Asia s cultural affinity for gold continues to feed the Love Trade  concern over government policies which increase inflation and devalue currencies  fuel the Fear Trade  The Fear Trade demanded attention again on the back of Janet Yellen s talk of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in the next six months 
While low interest rates make it less expensive to borrow money  measures to keep rates low also chip away the value of the dollar and cause concern of accelerating inflation  Once real rates start rising  gold isn t as attractive to those who trade on fear 
As I ve written about recently  a key driver in gold prices is the real interest rate environment   the real rate of return taking into account the level of inflation  When real interest rates are negative to low  gold prices historically turn positive because there is no opportunity cost to hold the metal  The lower the real rates  the better gold tends to do  So  Yellen s initial hint of rising rates sent gold prices falling 
On Friday the March U S  jobs number came in at 192 000  While the number is in line with expectations and clearly shows that hiring in the U S  is rising  it fell a bit short of the 200 000 jobs projected  The number was just enough of a miss to disturb investor confidence and drive some to seek refuge in hard assets  spurring the price of gold again 

BCA Research believes that after Friday s report  the current pace of employment will be sustained  Although the movement is gradual  hiring is going up 
BCA continued by commenting that  The data will underscore the Fed s view  that the need for quantitative easing or other non conventional tools is waning  but that there is no rush to normalize interest rates  
In my opinion  even with job numbers in line with expectations  the Fed is still going to focus on long term job creation and keeping interest rates low  or at least not rushing to normalize them as BCA research stated  If inflation starts to rise while these rates are low  we could see a higher movement in the price of gold 
Another headline maker for gold last week was Yamana Gold Inc  NYSE AUY  s purchase of 50 percent of Osisko s mining assets  I think our Portfolio Manager Ralph Aldis said it best in a recent BNN interview with Howard Green regarding the takeover   This deal is both sweet and sour  
The sour part is that by our models  which look at relative value of assets  it appears that both Osisko and Yamana are paying too much on this deal  On the flip side  the sweet part is that this bid caused companies like Mirasol Resources Ltd   MRZ V   Pretium Resources Inc   PVG  and Semafo Inc   SMF TO  to immediately rise  The structure of the entire deal is a complicated one  but witnessing these stocks finally waking up  is a change in the sentiment for the gold sector that  in my opinion  needed to be seen 
At U S  Global Investors we are always watching for opportunity  while concurrently managing risk  Along with the  sweetness  of the Osisko deal  I find additional encouragement for the broader commodities space  as well as for gold  from Stifel Nicolaus  Barry Banister  His strategy for the second quarter of the year is that we may see a one year rally in commodity related stocks 
Based on the breakout of the Continuous Commodities Futures  CRB  Index  along with the movement in the U S  dollar  he forecasts that commodities could rise 15 percent year over year in 2014 

High Frequency Trading became a household word overnight when bestselling author Michael Lewis gave an interview to 60 Minutes in advance of his new book   Flash Boys   Lewis  allegations of high frequency trading practices that result in a rigged stock market have prompted a firestorm of support from Charles Schwab to Mark Cuban 
I agree with Schwab  chairman of The Charles Schwab Corporation  NYSE SCHW   who said  high frequency trading has run amok and is corrupting our capital market system by creating an unleveled playing field for individual investors and driving the wrong incentives for our commodity and equity exchanges   I m glad to see this issue getting the attention it deserves 
From short selling to overreaching regulation  over the years I ve shared my opinions on practices that harm individual investors and create unjust advantages in our free market system  I believe that investing is key to long term wealth creation and that investor confidence in the system is key to capitalism 
The first quarter of the year has certainly provided surprises for the gold market  but remember that every coin has two sides  Every downward data point has an upside opportunity  Follow the smart money  stay diversified and remain a curious investor ",2014-04-16,Commodity Trade Mantra,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold’s-first-quarter-surprise-209780,209780
195514,417030,SCHW,Will Robo Advisors Kill Off Human Advisors ,opinion,"On Wednesday  I covered   which automatically reduce their equity exposure as time progresses 
Target date funds are becoming very popular for retirement accounts  but their elegant simplicity has a major shortcoming 
By design  they group people together based on an estimated retirement year  But in reality  everyone has a different risk tolerance  even those planning on retiring within the same timeframe 
Unsurprisingly  a technological solution to this problem has emerged  And many people  including the prominent venture capital backers  believe this is the next major disruptive force within the financial services industry 
Here s how the process works 
You fill out an online questionnaire  which is used to gauge your risk tolerance  Then  a computer algorithm utilizes this information to determine an appropriate mix of relatively uncorrelated asset class categories  Your customized portfolio is created using exchange traded funds  ETFs  and is periodically rebalanced  Throw in some bells and whistles such as tax loss harvesting  and presto  you have what s known as a robo advisor 
These software based financial advisors are marketed as a less expensive alternative to human financial advisors 
So  is this really the asteroid that will kill off the dinosaur advisors 
Could one of these robo advisors even become as successful as Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  
Let s take a closer look to find out 
Automated  Index Based  Low Cost
Wealthfront  the largest robo advisor  reached  1 billion in assets under management in June 2014  only 2 5 years after inception 
It s aimed at a younger  tech savvy demographic that may be uncomfortable with professional money managers 
The firm even states on its website   Why trust your money to a Wall Street money manager who charges steep fees when well designed software can do a better job for a lot less   Wealthfront is an appealing alternative to putting your money with a Goldman Sachs  UBS  or other private wealth manager  
Shots fired 
Wealthfront charges 0 25  of assets  no charge for accounts under  10 000  for its automated investment solutions  There are no commissions or other account fees  but you still pay the individual ETF management fees  which is why low cost Vanguard ETFs are often selected 
Below is a sample Wealthfront portfolio 

As you can see  it s broadly diversified among various asset class categories 
The lack of Treasuries or a cash component is certainly noteworthy  and this will make it even more interesting to see how the clients respond in a bear market for stocks 
Without a human to calm their fears  will they close their account when faced with losses 
Naturally  many traditional financial advisors are critical of robo advisors  That s probably because they see them as a threat  whether they ll admit it or not 
But financial advisors are facing an even bigger problem 
In a response to the rise of the robo advisors  Vanguard has made a huge announcement 
The fund giant recently rolled out the Vanguard Personal Advisor Services  which basically includes everything you get from a robo advisor for a flat 0 3  fee  but you also get access to a flesh and blood certified financial planner 
Vanguard has managed to integrate the human element for a very low cost 
The only catch is that you need a minimum account value of  100 000  but it s rumored that this threshold may be lowered in the future  Also  this is still much lower than the  500 000 minimum for the firm s existing Vanguard Asset Management Services  which carries a 0 7  fee 
You see  one of Vanguard s advantages is its mutual ownership structure  The fund s shareholders effectively own Vanguard through its funds  and this motivates the firm to operate at cost  rather than for profit 
This means the robo advisors are going to have to compete with a firm that has  2 86 trillion in assets under management  but which also has a structure that inherently prioritizes the interests of the client  That s going to be a tough slog 
Vanguard reminds us that it   not the robo advisors   is the main disruptor  and the robo advisors are simply expediting a commoditization of basic investment services by introducing even more competition 
Competition is Beautiful
Ultimately  investors are the real winners because of lower prices 
Think of it this way 
There s a continuum of solutions out there to solve your investment needs  from simple target date funds to full service private wealth management 
Whether they re fully automated or there s a lot of personal touch  all of the options are getting less expensive due to competition 
Gone are the days of a financial advisor charging 1  per year for basic portfolio construction and little else  Many advisors use in house software similar to that of the robo advisors anyway 
Financial advisors will need to be much more than investment advisors to justify their additional cost  They ll need to provide planning services addressing more complex issues such as taxes  estate planning  and insurance 
Yes  weak advisors will be eliminated  and many registered investment advisory  RIA  firms may shutter  But the wealthy will always tend to desire a human advisor 
Regardless  competition may be bad for financial advisors  but it s ultimately good for investors in the form of lower prices and more choices 
Even though robo advisors are essentially glorified target date funds  there s little doubt that the average retail investor can benefit from these online investment advisory platforms 
Robo advisors may not be perfect  but to paraphrase Voltaire  let s not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good 
Luckily  we don t have to sit around and figure out how robo advisors will attract a sufficient number of clients  Perhaps one  or all  will be acquired and melded into a full service brokerage model 
Whatever the outcome  we have and will continue to benefit from the competition in the financial services industry 
Efficient Markets Hypothesis
Robo advisors operate under the overarching principle that the markets are efficient  or are at least efficient enough to make it extremely difficult to outperform the market 
Burton Malkiel  Efficient Market Hypothesis  EMH  proponent and author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street  is actually on Wealthfront s investment team 
So  it s no surprise that the firm s principles are grounded in modern portfolio theory and passive indexing 
I  on the other hand  firmly believe that the markets are inefficient enough to provide opportunities to outperform based on well informed insights and active management 
I m also of the opinion that the providers of sound investment ideas and analysis will never go extinct

195532,417048,SCHW,Dual ETF Momentum   May Update,opinion,In February I announced a new  spreadsheet  The idea was inspired by a paper written by Gary Antonacci and available on  The spreadsheet is available on Scott s Investment s here  The objective of the spreadsheet is to track four pairs of ETFs and provide an  Invested  signal for the ETF in each pair with the highest relative momentum Relative momentum is gauged by the 12 month total returns of each ETF  The 12 month total returns of each ETF is also compared to a short term Treasury bill ETF  a  cash  filter   In order to have an  Invested  signal the ETF with the highest relative strength must also have 12 month total returns greater than the 12 month total returns of the cash ETF  This is the absolute momentum filter which is detailed in depth by Antonacci  and has historically helped increase risk adjusted returns I have added an  average  return signal for each ETF on the spreadsheet  The concept is the same as the 12 month relative momentum  However  the  average  return signal uses the average of the past 3  6  and 12   3 6 12   month total returns for each ETF  The  invested  signal is based on the ETF with the highest relative momentum for the past 3  6 and 12 months  The ETF with the highest average relative strength must also have an average 3 6 12 total returns greater than the 3 6 12 total returns of the cash ETF Below are the four portfolios along with current signals  As you can see  the 12 month and 3 6 12 signals are the same with the exception of the Real Estate risk portfolio  REM has higher 12 month returns than VNQ  however  VNQ has higher 3 6 12 returns than REM As an added bonus  the spreadsheet also has four additional sheets using a dual momentum strategy with broker specific commission free ETFs for TD Ameritrade  Charles Schwab  Fidelity  and Vanguard  It is important to note that each broker may have additional trade restrictions and the terms of their commission free ETFs could change in the future  Also  the dual momentum strategy has historically had relatively low turnover If you enjoy these free tools  please consider making a donation on the home page of Scott s Investments using the Paypal link in the upper right corner Disclaimer  Stock Loon LLC  Scott s Investments and its author is not a financial adviser  Stock Loon LLC  Scott s Investments and its author does not offer recommendations or personal investment advice to any specific person for any particular purpose  Please consult your own investment adviser and do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions  Please read the full disclaimer at the bottom of ,2013-05-12,Scott's Investments,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dual-etf-momentum-–-may-update-166515,166515
195537,417053,SCHW,Mr  Market Smells A Rat,opinion,Anxiety is on the rise in assuming that the fiscal cliff will bring trouble for the economy if the  500 billion in scheduled tax hikes and spending cuts is allowed to kick in come January  But guess what  The pain has already started  courtesy of the forward looking focus of the capital markets The stock market in particular is adjusting accordingly amid the self inflicted pain that Washington seems intent on dispatching to the country  The S P 500 is down about 7  since mid October and the slide will probably roll on without progress on defusing the fiscal cliff threat  I see very little to be optimistic about right now until we get some more clarity on these pressing issues   Randy Frederick  managing director of active trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab   Co    The crowd is inclined to agree  a view that s reverberating throughout the markets  The benchmark 10 year Treasury yield has been falling consistently for the past month  dipping to 1 58  yesterday the lowest since the end of August  The market s implied inflation forecast is fading too  The yield spread on the nominal 10 year Treasury less its inflation indexed counterpart yesterday inched down to 2 38   or the lowest since September  The preference for safety isn t a good sign  The fact that investors are willing  still  to chase Treasuries at such painfully low rates says a lot about sentiment these days  None of this is surprising  Risky assets taking it on the chin and a new round of disinflation deflationary winds are blowing  There s still time to short circuit this train wreck  but time is running short  The truly sad part is that the economic data has been decent lately  and if the fiscal cliff was a non issue it wouldn t be hard to imagine that the prospects for growth would be fairly encouraging right about now  But that s all on hold because of you know what  The economy for the moment is at the mercy of politics in Washington  Not surprisingly  the results are ugly  What skill set might get us out of this mess  A flair for herding cats comes to mind ,2012-11-17,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mr.-market-smells-a-rat-143855,143855

195548,417064,SCHW,Equity Put Call Ratio Approaching 1 0,opinion,In the third week of August last year we noted the equity put call ratio had climbed above 1 0  As we wrote in that post    The equity P C ratio tends to measure the sentiment of the individual investor by dividing put volume by call volume  At the extremes  this particular measure is a contrarian one  hence  P C ratios above 1 0 signal overly bearish sentiment from the individual investor  This indicator s average over the last 5 years is approximately  7  indicating the individual investor has been generally mostly bullish and more active on the call volume side   The S P 500 Index closed at 1 123 on 8 19 2011 and traded sideways to down before reaching a low of 1 099 on 10 3  So from August 19 to October 3 of last year  the S P fell an additional 2 1  after the equity put call ratio rose above 1 0    Well  here we are today with the P C ratio approaching 1 0 again and bearish sentiment at elevated levels  The news that triggered the decline last year is not too different from the news impacting the market currently  Following is what we wrote in August last year    At HORAN  we believe business fundamentals are contrasting with equity market actions  This divergence is being driven in large part by the lack of confidence in Europe in dealing with its sovereign debt issues and in Washington s inability to deal with its budget deficit  Additionally  the amount of regulatory uncertainty that includes health care reform and potential income tax reform is a factor in business  ability to commit to longer term expansion plans   Liz Ann Sonders  Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab  notes  But there is a long list of positive offsets this year relative to the past two years Inflation is coming down  especially among commodity prices Credit growth is quite strong  especially for consumers Housing has improved markedly The US manufacturing sector is humming NFIB s small business survey made recent upside breakout Job growth is much better Consumer confidence is improving Private sector leverage ratios are much improved  debt servicing costs are extremely low  Recovery in state local government spending The US economy somewhat decoupling from rest of world  at least Europe US bank capital health is much better than Europe s The European Central Bank s Long Term Refinancing Operations have reduced likelihood of global financial contagion Germany appears more willing to accept higher inflation  opening the door to easier monetary policy for the eurozone Valuations are quite cheap  especially on forward earnings Investor sentiment has improved sharply with the correction to date  meaning pessimism has kicked back in  It is difficult to predict a market bottom and certainly the S P 500 index could trade lower in the very near term  however  business fundamentals look positive and sentiment is approaching levels indicating we are pessimism may be overdone ,2012-05-21,Blog of HORAN Capital Advisors,https://www.investing.com/analysis/equity-put-call-ratio-approaching-1.0-123753,123753
195549,417065,SCHW,The Consequences Of U S  Government Expenditures Outpacing Revenue,opinion,One fact of little debate is the U S  continues to spend at a rate far outpacing the amount of revenue it receives  The consequence of this level of spending is the U S  government continues to take on a greater amount of debt each year  Further complicating this mismatch between revenue and expenditures is the level of  mandatory  expenditures is growing at a 7  rate according to the OMB  A recent report by  and notes Government outlays soared from 20 1  of GDP in the last Bush term to 24 4  in 2009 12  Meanwhile  government receipts fell from 17 9  of GDP in the last Bush years to 15 3  in the Obama years Over half the drop in receipts has been due to lower payroll taxes After 2013  the Office of Management and Budget projects interest on publicly held debt will jump from 8 8  to 14 5  of total receipts OMB also projects that  mandatory  federal spending will rise at a 7  annual rate  from 2011 to 2017  as fast as it did in the past six years The deficit is expected to decline to 3  of GDP over time  but that is based on the assumption that individual and corporate income taxes rise by rates of 10  and 17   respectively ,2012-06-27,Blog of HORAN Capital Advisors,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-consequences-of-u.s.-government-expenditures-outpacing-revenue-127784,127784
195556,417072,SCHW,QE3 is still on the Table,opinion,After the blowout number from Friday s Non Farm Payroll  NFP  release  there was some buzz that it would lessen the probability that the Federal Reserve would undertake QE3  I don t think so  According to its   the Fed has a 2  inflation target but no target for employment  emphasis added   The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy  and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer run goal for inflation  The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent  as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures  is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve s statutory mandate  Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer term inflation expectations firmly anchored  thereby fostering price stability and moderate long term interest rates and enhancing the Committee s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances  The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market  These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable  Consequently  it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment  rather  the Committee s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment  recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision  The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments  Information about Committee participants  estimates of the longer run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC s Summary of Economic Projections   recently published a research note indicating that the Fed is watching inflation as measured by core PCE because it has a lower housing weight than CPI  emphasis added   The Fed also announced an explicit 2  inflation target for the first time in its history  This explicit inflation target also helps reduce uncertainty about policy long term  The Fed will use the 2  annual target  based on changes in personal consumption expenditures  PCE  as their measure  The current year over year increase in PCE is 1 8  in the latest numbers  So they re still a touch below those targets  Bernanke was asked in the press conference following the meetings   why PCE and not the consumer price index   One reason is that in CPI  housing has a far greater weight  It appears to have understated inflation during the housing bubble and may overstate it now that renting is more popular than buying  The PCE is also adjusted more flexibly to changing consumption patterns  Fed critics might also argue that annual increases in PCE also tend to be lower than changes in the CPI   Remember  under the Fed s new transparency initiative  we don t have to guess what the Fed is going to do anymore and revealing their methodology  Consider these figures from the  for PCE  core PCE and trimmed mean PCE  which is another technique for excluding the more volatile components of the inflation rate Any way you look at it  core PCE and trimmed mean PCE remains stubbornly low and below the 2  target  This suggests to me that the Fed believes it has more room to stimulate without igniting an inflationary spiral  Watch this series for hints that QE3 might be moving off the table and don t fret about signs of a cyclical rebound from economic releases like NFP ,2012-02-06,Cam Hui,https://www.investing.com/analysis/qe3-is-still-on-the-table-113154,113154
195557,417073,SCHW,Oil Prices WILL Slow The Economy,opinion,Over the last few days they have been quite a few articles and comments made about the recent rise in oil and gasoline prices There is a growing consensus among the mainstream analyst community that  this time is different  because the rise in oil prices  and the subsequent rise in gasoline prices  haven t cracked the economy  Recently  stated that   At some point  a continued surge would be a risk to the positive market and economic outlook I ve had for some time  but at this stage it s not a deal breaker for the recovery  For one thing  in the past century  the real price of gasoline has spent almost all its time between  2 and  4  in current dollars   and we re within that range today Yes  oil price spikes preceded the 1973  1980  1991  2001 and 2007 recessions  but the spike in early 2011 did not lead to one  and I believe the current spike will also be an exception  US consumers are now much better positioned to weather higher energy prices  with well improved job growth and consumer confidence  credit growth picking up  aggressive Fed stimulus and record low natural gas prices  Most important is the fact that energy price inflation last year was largely spurred by the second round of quantitative easing by the Fed  QE2   whereas today s driver is global growth  Liz is correct on a couple of points Natural gas prices are near historic lows but those low prices aren t necessarily being passed on by utility companies to the end consumers as witnessed by the rise in the consumer price index of fuel and utlities  She is also right that the spike in oil in 2011 did not lead to a recession  However  the economy did contract sharply and without QE 2 and the introduction of Operation Twist  the ongoing Permanent Open Market Operations and LTRO  it is arguable whether or not the economy would have potentially slipped into a recession   However  for a few trillion dollars you too can buy an economic recovery As far as gasoline goes  utilizing the data provided by the Federal Reserve Board  I have created an inflation adjusted gasoline price chart   Sharp rises in gasoline prices have led to economic contractions in the past  Had it not been for the massive mortgage equity extractions and explosion in credit between 2005 2007 it is likely that a recession would have set in sooner Likewise the current rise in gasoline prices  along with oil prices  have not impacted the economy   yet  However  again  the shear fact that the economy has not slipped at this point is due to the ongoing injections of liquidity into the economy as witnessed by the chart of M2 Money Supply versus inflation adjusted oil prices With M2 surging to a new record high in recent months it is not unlikely that we will continue to see oil prices rise further  along with gasoline  As oil prices rise so do input costs to companies and prices to consumers  It is somewhat naive to think that just because a recession hasn t occured as of yet   that it won t  In fact  had it not been for the collapse in oil prices during 2011 from over  100 a barrel to below  80  as the economy shrank to only slightly above the zero line  a recession would have ensued  In a bit of disagreement with Liz  while there are some slight improvements in the underlying economic fabric  the consumer  as a whole  is effectively worse off today than they have been at any other time in this century   With 1 in 4 homeowners underwater in their mortgage  86 million no longer counted as part of the workforce  47 million on food stamps  real unemployment still at recessionary levels along with consumer confidence   it will not take oil prices at these lofty levels for very long to erode the economy even with continued liquidity injections Liz states that employment is improving That statement would be true if you look only at the BLS measure of employment However  it is the entire population that affects the economy  Just because someone is retired  unemployed  working part time or are a stay at home spouse  they still consume at some level Their ability to consume is affected by the cost of oil as it affects everything that we consume or use The chart of employment to population ratio relative to the rise and fall of oil prices gives us a much better image of the impact on rising input costs to companies and underlying employment If this chart holds true the recent improvement in employment that we have seen  which has primarily been temporary hires  will be fleeting and the employment to population ratio is likely to decline further As my father used to say   That ain t good There is a bit of irony to this as well As oil and gasoline prices rise which causes individuals to spend more on food  gasoline and utilities it shows up as an increase in consumer spending The media then gets all excited that the consumer is spending more which is great for the economy  That is true initially  however  the as more and more of disposable income is consumed by the basics of survival   the rest of the economy will begin to suffer The chart shows the total consumption of oil  in millions of dollars  as a percentage of real disposable income   As oil prices increase consuming more of disposable incomes economic growth is impacted The last time oil consumption reached 20  of DPI the economy slowed to near zero Furthermore  and more importantly in my opinion  is that the continuing rise in oil consumption as percentage of DPI has led to a continued impedence to economic growth   This is shown by the declining linear trend of real GDP as the rise in the cost of oil consumption has consumed a larger share of a finite amount of disposable incomes Furthermore  with year over year real disposable incomes on the decline over the last couple of years it is highly likely that an impact to the consumer will come sooner rather than later Maybe this is why  despite the recent bounce due to the liquidity driven surge in the financial markets  consumer confidence still remains at recessionary levels Despite a lot of recent media rhetoric   consumers are still very despondent about the prospects of the economy as a whole Consumer confidence has also been affected by the rises  spikes and falls of oil prices since  as stated previously  it directly impacts their ability to maintain their current standard of living Consumer confidence will improve temporarily  as oil prices rise  as long as other areas such as employment  the financial markets  or incomes also improve concurrently  However  that improvement in confidence is generally fairly short lived as improvements in individual incomes  employment and investments are fairly finite in nature Therefore  as the rise in oil prices begins to outpace other relative improvements   consumer confidence  along with spending and the economy  is broken So  with all due respect to Liz  the recent surge in oil prices has very little to due with global growth   It has recently been a function of liquidity driven speculation as we noted in   With net reportable contracts on crude oil at the second highest level on record  combined with continued infusions of liquidity into the global markets  as with the second round of LTRO today   it is only a function of time until that liquidity finds its way into the highly liquid and leveraged oil and commodity markets driving prices higher  This will ultimately show up in headline consumer inflation as well as in the upcoming personal income reports as consumers divert more income into basic necessities of food and energy  This ultimately detracts from their ability to purchase other discretionary items impacting corporate earnings and will continue to pressure on already reduced profit margin expectations While rising oil and gasoline prices have not immediately thrown the economy  under the bus  it doesn t mean that it won t happen  With a tremendous amount of artificial intervention into the financial markets and economies on a global scale   things can remain irrational longer than most expect The trap  however  is being complacent that  this time is different    it never is Furhermore  complacency can lead to far greater losses than you can imagine ,2012-03-01,Lance

195558,417074,SCHW,3 Financial Dividend Stocks With Institutional Buying and Solid Growth,opinion,After being the worst sector in 2011  and losing over  17   Financial stocks are among the best stocks to buy in 2012 for price gains thus far  beating all other sectors  Even with this major turnaround  Financials are still down  2 3  over the past year Part of the recent momentum for Financials came from the Greek debt agreement being signed  and improving US economic data  Another major plus was the Fed s mainly successful stress tests for major banks this week  but the big impetus is that this sector had much better  2011 4th earnings  even though its sales growth was flat Which Financial sector dividend paying stocks are the big boys buying  It looks like some of the brokerage firms and one exchange are getting institutional support  particularly this small cap stock  Interactive Brokers  which is just  3  below its 52 week high  but only up 10 79  for the past year Dividends  Although these dividend yields aren t as high as some of the High Dividend Stocks we often write about  they all have above average dividend yields for their industry  In addition  you can improve upon these dividend payouts dramatically by using options trading strategies  such as selling covered call options   see further below     CME also had a special  3 00 share dividend that went ex dividend in March  and increased its quarterly payouts by 22   to  1 40  from  1 15  in 2011 Valuations  So  why are Institutional buyers so supportive of IBKR  Many reasons  IBKR has a very low PEG ratio  outstanding yearly and quarterly EPS and Sales growth  and its Price Book and Price Sales valuations are way below industry averages   CME also has a low PEG  low Price Book   and good EPS growth  but buyers are probably worried about potential future gov t regulations for exchanges  stemming from the MF Global scandal   Schwab s PEG is also low  but like CME  its recent quarterly sales slowed vs  Q4 2010 Financials  All of these stocks have above avg  industry Mgt  Efficiency Ratio and Operating Margins  and carry a lot less debt than the industry average  IBKR and Schwab go head to head in the online discount brokerage segment  but IBKR has a much higher operating margin Covered Calls  If you re looking to earn more income now from these dividend stocks  but still participate in some potential price gains  selling covered call options above the stock s current price is one way to go   Covered Call sellers get paid an often lucrative call premium now  in return for committing to potentially have to sell the underlying stock at a given strike price by expiration time   Each option contract corresponds to 100 shares of the underlying stock  If you re more bullish on a stock  you d sell covered call options further above its current price share  but you ll give up some immediate call option   now for potential future price gains down the road  In all of the trades below  the call option premiums are up to 7 times the dividend payouts   Annualized potential assigned yield equals the difference between the strike price and the stock s share price  divided by the share price  The Annualized Total Potential Assigned Yields listed below are comprised of 3 income streams  The   amounts for CME are 1  Dividends   2 80 share    280 00 per option contract sold   You d collect 2 quarterly  1 40 share dividends 2  Call option premiums   18 80 share    18 80 per option contract sold   You d get paid this   within 3 days of selling the call options  often even the same day 3  Potential Assigned Price Gains   3 75 share    375 00 per option contract sold   This usually occurs at or near expiration time Cash Secured Puts  SInce these stocks have rallied so much in 2012  you may wish you could turn back the clock and dive in at a lower price   One way you can do this  is by selling cash secured put options at a strike price below the stock s current price   You ll be paid a put premium that is often much higher than the stock s dividends over the next 2 3 quarters  in return for committing to buy the stock at the put strike price  For example  in the 2 put trades below  these puts pay over 7 to 9 times what the dividends pay   We listed the dividends for comparison sake only   put sellers don t receive dividends  In the SCHW trade below  you d be paid  1 10 for committing to potentially buy SCHW at  15 00 by Sept 22  2012  if SCHW s price goes below  15 00 at or near expiration time  But  if you end up buying SCHW at  15 00  your cost will only be

195559,417075,SCHW,Anybody Left To Buy ,opinion,Five reports suggest that contrary to popular belief  the  crowd     investors  traders  and market advisors    is bullish  and invested     Business Insider  According to Morgan Stanley  there s no question about the state of big investors sentiment  As they put it  investors are  all in  on this market   Bloomberg  Hedge funds trailing the Standard   Poor s 500 Index for the last five months are giving up on bearish bets and buying stocks at the fastest rate in two years  A gauge of hedge fund bullishness measuring the proportion of bets that shares will rise climbed to 48 6 last week from 42 at the end of November 2011  the biggest increase since April 2010  according to data compiled by the International Strategy   Investment Group  The Bloomberg aggregate hedge fund index gained 1 4 percent last month  lagging behind the Standard   Poor s 500 Index by 2 65 percentage points  Money managers struggling to catch up with the gains have contributed to the rally that pushed the S P 500 up 27 percent since October as economic reports beat estimates  Market bulls say they are a continuing source of cash that can move stocks higher  Bears say capitulating hedge funds are further evidence that equities have risen too far  too fast as economic growth remains sluggish  warning that the pool of potential buyers is being depleted    Slope of Hope  The below chart is from decisionpoint com  Take note that the Rydex  A financial services firm whose mutual funds and ETFs are favorites of more active traders  asset ratio is currently breaking out to new highs over the past 10 years  which shows an extreme amount of bullishness on the part of investors  Carl Swenlin of decisionpoint com states   Digging deeper into the numbers    Money Market Assets are near 10 year lows  which indicates that Rydex investors have very little money on the sidelines with which to make an additional commitment to bullish positions  Also  Bear Fund Assets are near 10 year lows  demonstrating that Rydex investor expectations for bearish outcomes is very low  These bullish attitudes are bearish for the market because it appears that there are very few resources left to fuel a continued price advance       CNBC    Bullish sentiment among the most active clients of Charles Schwab hit its highest level since the current bull market began  according to a recent survey by the firm    The jump in optimism from this group may signal the less active crowd will soon follow  propelling the rally to a fourth year  market analysts said    Fifty one percent of individual investors who trade frequently are now bullish  according to the Charles Schwab Active Trader Sentiment Survey  the highest level since they began surveying these clients in April 2008      MarketWatch  Commentary  There is too much bullishness and complacency   The stock market s long awaited correction appears to have begun    I say this because the market s successful assault on Dow 13 000 brought a number of eager bulls out of the woodwork   so much so  in fact  that even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now fallen back to just above that 13 000 level  there is a lot more bullish sentiment than existed just two weeks ago    That s worrisome from a contrarian point of view    Consider the average recommended stock market among a subset of short term stock market timers tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest  as measured by the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index  or HSNSI   After the Dow s initial failure in late February and early March to burst through the 13 000 level  this average dropped by March 9 to as low as 17 6    which meant that the average market timer was keeping more than 80  of his equity portfolio out of the market    Today  even though the Dow is less than 1  higher than where it stood then  the HSNSI stands at 42 1   So a tiny net increase in the market has led the average market timer to increase his or her equity exposure by 25 percentage points    That s not reminiscent of the veritable Wall of Worry that bull markets like to climb    But then again  maybe this time is different  and the stock market doesn t need addiitonalbuyers  cash  or good news to move higher    No doubt some bulls will argue that mom and pop investors have yet to join the party  Given that a great many of them are in or near retirement and have far fewer assets than they need to survive as a result of multiple burst bubbles  a global financial crisis  chronic bad advice  and a brokerage community that likes to rip their eyeballs out  I m not sure I d put much faith in that  Of course  I could be wrong  Perhaps I am the greater fool ,2012-03-27,Michael Panzner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/anybody-left-to-buy-118272,118272
195560,417076,SCHW,Investors Distrust Wall Street    And that s Great News For This Stock,opinion,Thanks to Lehman Bros   Bernie Madoff  Ivan Boesky  Dennis Kozlowski  Henry Blodget and many others  most investors have had enough  They simply don t trust Wall Street and are convinced that the investing business is rigged for the benefit of those who know how to circumvent the rules    That s the only conclusion you can draw after reading up on the latest survey jointly conducted by The University of Chicago and Northwestern University  They recently discovered that just 16  of Americans trust the stock market    The fact that the survey s results come AFTER the stock market has doubled in value during the past three years is truly sobering  You can only imagine what investor sentiment would look like if the market fell 10  or 20  this year  or another financial executive was caught with his hands in the honey pot  Frankly  it s a shame  I d be a fan of much more regulation of Wall Street  which explains why I no longer have the stomach to work for Wall Street firms   but I still think investors shouldn t be shunning stocks  With the right amount of homework and the proper amount of risk aversion  investors can still make major gains as they build up retirement nest eggs   The fact that 84  of Americans shun stocks is unpleasant news for online brokerage firms such as E Trade  Nasdaq    and TD Ameritrade  Nasdaq     These firms must hope for investor trust to return if they are ever to see a robust rebound in sales and profits    Even many Wall Street employees have had enough  Wave after wave of stockbrokers have left the big firms to set up shop on their own  realizing that acting as an independent financial advisor looks a lot better to most clients    But there is a clear investable beneficiary of this trend  Charles Schwab  Nasdaq     which has been a virtual magnet for newly independent financial advisors  In the past decade  Schwab has seen a huge buildup of new clients  with some impressive numbers to show for it  as I ll detail in a moment    Unfortunately  you wouldn t spot this change by looking at Schwab s share price  The company has historically made solid profits by managing un invested client funds in interest bearing money market funds  And while the Federal Reserve has kept rates at rock bottom lows  Schwab s profits have barely budged  As rates start to normalize during the next few years  the stage is set for Schwab to become a profit powerhouse  Although the Fed insists that rates will stay low for several more years  this pledge will be impossible to maintain if the United States is able to rebound in coming quarters  A powerful base of assets  The stock brokerage industry began its tectonic shift in 2004  as Schwab and TD Ameritrade built up platforms to meet the needs of financial advisors who wanted to hang out their own shingle  Since then  these two firms have boosted assets under management  AUM  by registered investment advisors  RIAs  at an 8  annual compound rate  Meanwhile  AUM for the traditional firms such as Merrill Lynch  Smith Barney  UBS and others have been falling at a 3  annual pace  And this trend shows no sign of letting up    Part of the shift is intentional  Wall Street firms are increasingly focusing on the largest accounts  effectively telling mid sized accounts to take their business elsewhere  That s why the  1 2 trillion in assets managed by brokers using Schwab and other back office platforms  as of the end of 2010  according to a study conducted by Cerulli   Associates  is expected to swell to  1 5 trillion by mid decade    Schwab  with 56  of the RIA market  is the biggest beneficiary  TD Ameritrade  with an 8  share  is a distant second  while Fidelity has less than 5  of the market in third place   Fidelity  with a 24  market share  is the leader in managing investment retirement accounts  IRAs  for individuals  with Schwab and TD Ameritrade controlling 14  and 4   respectively     Yet as noted earlier  many investors avoid playing the market directly out of mistrust  which is why RIAs are building up assets at such a steady pace  To put real numbers behind this trend  note that Schwab s current asset base of RIA controlled assets is at  630 billion and could exceed  900 billion by 2015  according to Goldman Sachs    The rate hike scenario  The era of low interest rates can t end soon enough for Schwab  The company would likely see earnings per share  EPS  rise by 35  from current levels for every 100 basis point  1 0   increase in the federal funds rate  according to Goldman Sachs  as profit margins expand on money market accounts    To put this in context  Schwab is expected to earn  0 85 to  0 90 a share in 2013  Let s say the Fed funds rate is 100 basis points higher in 2014  Then you d be looking at  1 20 in EPS  A 200 basis point hike would turn out to be  1 50  And a 300 basis point hike likely equates to almost  2 a share in annual earnings power    Right now  Schwab is making life easy on its clients  waving 42 basis points out of the typical 57 basis points that it would receive on funds parked in money management accounts  As rates start to rise  Schwab won t need to offer that giveback  So what is now roughly  300 million in annual income for Schwab would be roughly  1 billion in annual income without it  That s almost as much as Schwab makes in its other three businesses combined  Funds and ETFs  OneSource fund distribution services and RIA platform fees  Risks to Consider  Shares of Schwab won t really start to percolate until investors have a clearer read on when the Fed will start to hike rates  Any moves won t likely come before the second half of 2013  but anticipation of such an event may start to get factored into earnings models for Schwab later this year    Action to Take     Charles Schwab has historically been seen as a proxy for investor interest in stocks  Yet the company s business model has steadily morphed  so its interest rates and RIA asset management have actually become the key drivers for this business  Schwab has had great success in putting the right platform in place  having attracted thousands of RIAs in recent years  It s only a matter of time before this bigger client base translates into much bigger profits  By David Sterman,2012-04-14,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investors-distrust-wall-street----and-that's-great-news-for-this-stock-120108,120108
195561,417077,SCHW,Why The Long Term Outlook For Stocks Keeps Getting Brighter,opinion,I don t need to tell you that s it tough out there  A pervasive sense of gloom continues to dog many U S  consumers  most of whom still anticipate more tough times to come  according to consumer confidence surveys  Some recent troublesome economic reports  led by a sharp drop in durable goods orders and an uptick in weekly jobless claims may be early signs that 2012 may be another year of tepid U S  economic growth  Over in Europe the mood is downright black  as key economies slip into recession  and the weaker countries look headed for more trouble    In that light  I expect a tough market in coming weeks and months    perhaps as soon as earnings season ends and we re no longer being fed a steady stream of good news  Indeed  the six month market rally that began in early October appears to have cooled for now  The S P 500 is on track to finish slightly lower in April    All of the headwinds have taken their toll with investors  The latest survey from the American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  tallies just 27 6  of investors in the bull camp  That s the lowest reading in seven months  though stocks tend to rally sharply when that figure moves to around 25   as was the case this past October  Yet even cautious investors  myself included  have to acknowledge the stunning performance being delivered by corporate America  Profits remain robust    despite numerous headwinds    and a case is emerging that profits will keep rising well into 2013  I ve had a chance to dig through the updated profit forecasts for various industries now that earnings are rolling in  and it s a good time to get an updated sense of the roadmap ahead By the numbers Even as consumer spending remains well below the levels seen five years ago  affecting retailers  lenders  and many other industries   companies have managed to already exceed profit levels seen back in 2007  And though it looked as if profit growth may finally start to flatten this year as further margin gains become elusive  first quarter results imply that the era of profit growth is not yet over  More than 75  of companies have topped profit forecasts thus far  Here s what Merrill Lynch now anticipates for profits in the S P 500   In fact  the 2012 and 2013 profit outlook would be even stronger were it not for the precipitous plunge in natural gas prices  which is pressuring profits in the energy sector  Mining firms are also experiencing profit woes right now  Moreover  U S  firms that operate in Europe are reporting very weak demand  as Ford  NYSE  F  reminded us on Friday  April 27   Were it not for these headwinds  current and projected profit growth would be nothing short of stunning    What price for growth   It s too early to think about what profits for companies in the S P 500 will look like in 2014  but if these just noted headwinds abate  i e  commodity prices firm up and Europe gets off the floor    we may be looking at  115 or even  120 in earnings per share  EPS  for the S P 500 by then    Let s focus on Merrill Lynch s 2013 profit outlook in the chart above for now  Today  the S P 500 trades at about 12 5 to 13 times projected 2013 profits  which is above the 2012 2013 earnings growth rate of 5  to 6   but below the historical mid teens market multiple  Merrill Lynch s forecasts are actually among the more conservative views on the Street  The consensus 2013 forecast stands at  119  But it s wise to focus on the low end of the consensus when trying to see the bull case for the market    I ve seen a lot of commentary lately saying that it s specious to argue that stocks are cheap compared to bonds  when earnings yields are compared to bond yields   I disagree  Low interest rates  which will surely rise but should stay relatively low in historical terms  are a key factor why companies  profits are so healthy  Low rates enable these companies to make ongoing investments with very low hurdles  since their cost of capital is so low  And that solid and rising backdrop for capital spending is what is fueling profits now    and in the future     What to buy   With the various headwinds in place and corporate profit growth showing no sign of letting up  your coming investment moves should focus on stocks that have solid potential upside but with a tangible degree of downside support  You already know my top ideas in that context  you can find them in my  100 000 Real Money Portfolio    But in recent weeks  a host of other solid value upside opportunities have been emerging on my radar  including    Charles Schwab  Nasdaq  SCHW   profiled    Weatherford Industries  NYSE  WFT   which is a global oil services provider trading at a tangible discount to larger rivals such as Schlumberger  NYSE  SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE  HAL    AMD  NYSE  AMD   which is an inexpensive way to play rising tech spending   Delta Airlines  NYSE  DAL   which is managing the current pricey oil environment well  and would be a clear beneficiary of an improving global economy in 2013 and 2014    None of these are hot stocks right now  which may actually be a good thing  You need to be especially wary of holding any stocks that have already made a strong run  as they are likely to be punished most severely if the U S   European or Chinese economies create fresh market turmoil    Risks to Consider  The global economic headwinds noted earlier need to be closely monitored  Europe in particular is showing recent worrisome signs of a fresh crisis  Also  the looming expiration of the Bush era tax cuts  coupled with agreed upon cuts in U S  government spending  are both expected to take root at the end of this year     That  fiscal cliff  is starting to get on the radars of market moving fund managers  How that issue gets handled will surely impact longer term corporate profits in many sectors    The next few months will be crucial for your investment strategy  The near term challenges imply that you should be harvesting profits in specific stocks as gains emerge  Yet the longer term backdrop suggests re investing funds into stocks that are out of favor now but hold solid multi year profit opportunities in a rising economy  by David

195562,417078,SCHW,The Safest Way To Invest In A Real Estate Bounce,opinion,More millionaires have been made in real estate than any other investment in the United States  All one had to do was start buying single family homes  rent them out to cover the mortgage payment  and then price appreciation would take care of the rest  It was an easy formula to riches  Millions upon millions actively took advantage of the housing bull market to build their nest egg  Still  millions more benefited from the boom  in a passive fashion  as their individual family home price skyrocketed into the stratosphere  In fact  from 1963 to 2007  the average home price exploded from less than  50 000 to more than  300 000  This represents more than a 600  return  I know a few hedge fund guys who would sell their grandmother for this type of performance  Add in the leverage and tax benefits and you had what appeared to be a no risk path to wealth  These soaring home prices combined with easy credit created a new class of hyper consumers who bought everything and anything with their new found wealth  This buying drove the economy to dizzying heights in the first seven years of the new millennium    Next  the impossible happened  The housing bubble burst in 2007  In retrospect  it was easy to see coming  however  only a few economic pundits warned of the bust  Many of the newfound real estate elite were revealed to be emperors with no clothes  as their heavily leveraged mini empires collapsed under their own weight  Multiple real estate investors were trapped  unable to sell in an illiquid market    This rapid decrease in prices led to the banking crisis  the government bailouts and too big to fail legislation   Now  finally  signs of the real estate market bottom are starting to surface  The relevant economic numbers have started to tick higher  indicating the worse may be over  Even the most pessimistic economists are agreeing that the bottom should be evident by mid 2013   Regardless of what economists tell us  many investors remain scared of real estate  Let s face it  real estate remains a relatively illiquid investment at this time  If you have ever tried to sell a home in a down market  then you know exactly what I mean  How can one benefit from the likely bounce in real estate prices without getting stuck    Well  the answer is by buying professionally managed Real Estate Investment Trusts  or REITs for short  These tools will enable you to catch the coming bounce in real estate without the liquidity risk of buying physical properties   Let s take a closer look at one that recently caught my interest      The number one real estate investment on my radar is the Schwab US REIT ETF  Nasdaq  SCHH   This exchange traded fund  ETF  is built upon the Dow Jones U S  Select REIT Index by investing in stocks included in the index  The fund has returned about 16  during the past year already    What I like most about this ETF is its diversification within the real estate sector  Its top holdings include the strong performing REITs such as Public Storage  NYSE  PSA   Simon Property Group  NYSE  SPG  and Equity Residential  NYSE  EQR   It s produced a steady dividend yield of about 2 6  during the past two years and has been in a steady uptrend this year  Perhaps  most interestingly  is that Charles Schwab Investment Advisory just added 262 400 shares to its holdings  I like seeing this type of insider interest   Technically  the 50 day simple moving average has been acting as solid support since December  2011  Shares have slipped from their high of  31 to about  30 during the past few trading sessions  Risks to Consider  Despite the strong performance of the Schwab REIT ETF  its performance remains tied to the uncertain real estate market  Although my research has indicated that the real estate bottom is in or very close  no one really knows what the future holds  Be certain to use stops and position size correctly when investing  This ETF has set up perfectly for a buying opportunity  As long as price stays above the 50 day simple moving average at  29 42  buying the current consolidation is the way to go  I view this ETF as a long term play  but only above the 50 day simple moving average  Right now  buying the pullback consolidation appears prudent  However  should shares slip below the 50 day simple moving average  buying breakouts above this level makes sense  REIT s  in general  show lesser correlation with the overall stock market than other ETF s  This makes REIT s the perfect way to diversify your portfolio BY Dave Goodboy,2012-05-11,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-safest-way-to-invest-in-a-real-estate-bounce-122872,122872
195569,417085,SCHW,ETFs in a 401k  The Wave is Building,opinion,There has been a lot of discussion concerning the use of exchange traded funds  ETFs  as the primary investment vehicle within 401k plans  The barriers that once stood in the way are being removed by innovative record keeping and the growing use of ETFs in private and institutional accounts  There are some compelling reasons as to why ETFs can force the door open into 401k plans across America PASSIVE vs  ACTIVEWe all believe  or want to believe  that we are winners  This mindset can take us far in life  but it is not necessarily how we should approach portfolio management  Of course we want to win in investing  but investors should focus long term  not on the hot stock  sector or asset class of the year  There is a growing realization that actively trading stocks and bonds for short term gain is a losing bet  We see this in a University of Maryland Study that shows  adjusted for risk  only 0 06  of fund managers beat their index from 1975 to 2007  1975 is an important year as this is the conception of the Vanguard S P 500 Index fund The buy and hold indexing approach is being fueled by two things  disenchantment with high cost  under performing active mutual fund managers  and the migration of brokers from commission firms to fee only platforms where a fiduciary responsibility forces a better look at active mutual fund management  These issues have increased the use of index funds  specifically exchange traded funds  As plan participants want their 401k accounts to look like their private accounts  ETFs are building momentum to fill this void  especially in small to mid size 401k plans  Plan fiduciaries also realize that adding indexing to active management plan options reduces their liability LOW COST INVESTINGIf a plan participant can save 1  a year in investment costs on a  20 000 portfolio  over a 20 year period that participant would have 17  more money  not accounting for any performance differences  The benefit of cost savings are more apparent over the last market decade where portfolio rates of return have been nearly flat after the 2000 tech crash  September 11th and the 2008 financial crisis  The average mutual fund costs 1 15   where the average iShares ETF costs 0 45   Core ETFs would be much less DIVERSIFICATIONIndex funds offer great diversification  IVV or SPY hold all 500 stocks within the S P 500  where as a similarly styled actively managed mutual fund may hold only 40   60 equities  some not even listed on the S P 500 ETFs can also provide plan participants access to harder to reach asset classes such as emerging market bonds  frontier markets  international bonds or commodities  All of these asset classes can be held at a cost of less than 0 50  TRANSPARENCYAsk any plan participant  or in some cases the plan sponsor  how much their plan costs  This includes the administration and investment fees  Very few will be able to tell you  In 2012 there is new regulation that will help change this  but up until this point transparency has been about as clear as a muddy river  Exchange traded funds provide a daily look into what is held within the portfolio  and management fees are fully disclosed  Add a report showing the participant plan administration fee and you will have a very transparent 401k WHO NEEDS ETFs TODAY One can argue that large plans have the negotiation power to lower plan participant investment costs  This is true to a certain extent  In some cases a Vanguard Index Tier may be more beneficial to plan participants versus exchange traded funds  The Vanguard Index Tier can drop investments costs below 0 05  if the plan is large enough  Indexing as an option if desired in these plans  whether it is an index mutual fund or exchange traded fund The real benefit for ETFs falls in plans with less than  100 million in assets  These 401k plans are currently being serviced by industry leaches such as the Hartford  VALIC  and other annuity based 401k 403b plans  Participants in these plans can pay nearly 3  annually in fees  Lowering their costs by 2  would be huge For some plans that do not offer any form of indexing  often the plan sponsor has allowed the plan provider to offer a brokerage link account  This is where a participant is allowed to move all or a portion of their 401k balance into a brokerage account under the 401k umbrella  Within this account a plan participant can purchase most equities and bonds including index mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds THE BARRIERAn exchange traded fund trades just like a stock  which means that they can be traded intraday with a bid and an ask spread   A net asset value  NAV  is also calculated  NAV is the value of the underlying securities   Mutual funds  on the other hand  trade at day end on NAV  There is a good probability that an intraday purchase of an ETF could be made at a value greater than the NAV  which is not a good thing for 401k plans  This issue has been solved by not allowing intraday trading of ETFs inside a 401k  Transactions will take place at the end of the day  just as mutual funds are currently traded  There has been noise that mutual funds have the same NAV issue but at a different level  There is debate that ETFs could  in the end  be traded more efficiently than mutual funds  This is actually good news for proponents of ETFs within 401ks  as just a short time ago this was a case closed win for mutual funds Another barrier for ETFs has been record keeping  Up until recently  accounting systems would only handle mutual funds  Participants can hold fractional shares of a mutual fund  ETFs trade in whole shares  This has changed  through new techniques fractional ETF ownership is possible THE PLAYERSSeveral companies are offering ETFs within 401k plans  The larger players are ING s Sharebuilder 401k  Charles Schwab  Invest N Retire  WisdomTree  iShares and TD Ameritrade  All of these companies have invested into architecture that allows for the efficient use of ETFs within a 401k plan USERSPlan sponsors that use ETFs within their plans are innovators  and the organizations understand investing at a level higher than the average sponsor  Case in point  Apple uses all ETFs within its 401k plans  This technology leader is now demonstrating its core value of innovation in its 401k plans as well   As other CFOs and HR directors learn about indexing and the use of exchange traded funds  the ultimate winners will be plan participants ,2012-01-09,Casey
