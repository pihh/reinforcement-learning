A10 s revenue fell 2 4 percent to  60 5 million in its third quarter that ended Sept  30  compared with  62 million a year earlier  It narrowed its net loss to  1 8 million or 2 cents a share  compared with a net loss of  2 25 million a year or 3 cents a share ",2018-11-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive-a10-networks-explores-potential-sale--sources-1698645,1698645
21537,243052,RDWR,YY Q2 Earnings Miss Estimates  Live Streaming Revenues Solid,opinion,YY Inc    NASDAQ YY   delivered second quarter 2019 non GAAP earnings of 75 cents per American depositary shares  ADS   which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents and declined significantly from the year ago reported figure of  2 03 Revenues totaled  917 million  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  881 45 million In domestic currency  non GAAP earnings per ADS declined 62 6  to RMB5 4 while revenues of RMB 6 3 billion rose 66 8  Top Line DetailsThe top line growth can primarily be attributed to strong live streaming revenues  which increased 66 4  year over year to RMB5 92 billion  accounting for 94 1  of total net revenues in the reported quarter Notably  other revenues increased 74 4  to RMB372 5 5 million  primarily driven by robust growth in advertising revenues from HUYA and BIGO YY Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The stellar performance of YY Live and HUYA Live also contributed to the impressive top line growth  YY and HUYA Live contributed 48 3  and 32 4   respectively to total live streaming revenues in the second quarter  Further  year over year growth at YY Live and HUYA Live was 11 5  and 93 7   respectively Additionally  average mobile live streaming monthly active users  MAUs  increased 39 2  year over year globally to 140 9 million wherein YY

YY Live and HUYA increased 12 9  and 92 1  year over year to RMB1 63 billion and RMB1 67 billion  respectively  This was due to rise in revenue sharing fees and content costs However  the increase in revenue sharing fees and content costs paid to performers and content providers was in line with the increase in live streaming revenues for both YY Live and Huya segments  Notably  revenue sharing fees and content costs increased to RMB3 15 billion in second quarter 2019 from RMB1 88 billion reported in the year ago quarter Moreover  bandwidth costs in the reported quarter were RMB423 8 million compared with RMB246 million in year ago reported quarter  The increase was due to expansion of the overseas user base  primarily due to the consolidation of BIGO Operating DetailsGross profit climbed 45 4  from the year ago quarter to RMB2 12 billion  However  gross margin contracted 500 basis points  bps  to 33 7  in the second quarter  primarily due to higher revenue sharing fees and content costs  The decrease was also attributed to low gross margin of HUYA and BIGO Operating expenses totaled RMB2 09 billion  up 168 2  from the year ago quarter  This was due to the company s increased investment in sales   marketing initiatives in domestic and global markets Research   development  R D   sales   marketing  S M  and general   administrative  G A  expenses grew 121 5   346 7   and 41

21541,243056,RDWR,5 Stocks With Rising P E That Won t Let You Down,opinion,"Picking bargain hunting stocks or in other words stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio is a popular investing strategy   This is especially true in the current scenario as U S  equities are hitting all time highs and investors might be interested in looking out for cheap or value stocks 
Investors believe that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  The logic is simple   a stock s current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside 
But there is more to this whole P E story as not only low P E  stocks with a rising P E can also fetch solid returns 
Rising P E  An Useful Tool
Generally  the price of a stock rallies on a rise in earnings  As forecasts for expected earnings move higher  demand for the stock should drive its price  After all  astock s P E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out for every dollar of earnings  Thus  if the P E of a stock is rising steadily  it means that investors are pinning their hopes on the company s inherent strength 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 41 
Here are five of the 41 stocks 
Civeo Corporation    NYSE CVEO     It is a provider of long term and temporary remote site accommodations  logistics and facility management services  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
InspireMD Inc     NYSE NSPR     It is a medical device company focusing on the development and commercialization of its proprietary stent system technology  MGuard  It belongs to a favorable Zacks industry  placed at the top 38  of 250  industries   The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2 
Westport Fuel Systems Inc     NASDAQ WPRT     This Zacks Rank  2 company is a developer  manufacturer and supplier of advanced alternative fuel systems and components 
Genesco Inc     NYSE GCO     The specialty retailer  sells footwear  headwear and accessories in retail stores in the United States and Canada carries a Zacks Rank  1  It comes from a favorable Zacks industry  top 16   
Radware Ltd     NASDAQ RDWR     It develops  manufactures and markets products that manage and direct Internet traffic among network resources to enable continuous access to Web sites and other services  applications and content based on Internet protocol  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and hails from a favorable Zacks industry  top 7

21632,243147,RDWR,Radware  RDWR  Is Overbought  Is A Drop Coming 	,opinion,"Radware Ltd    NASDAQ RDWR   has moved higher as of late  but there could definitely be trouble on the horizon for this company  That is because RDWR is now in overbought territory with an RSI value of 78 88 
What is RSI  
RSI stands for  Relative Strength Index  and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors  It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down  readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought  while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present 
Other Factors
Yet RDWR s high RSI value isn t the only reason for investors to be concerned  as there has been some decidedly negative earnings estimate revisions in Radware s stock as of late  This is especially true when investors dive into some of these revisions in order to get a better picture of RDWR s prospects for the near term 
Over the past two months  investors have witnessed 2 earnings estimate revision lower compared to none higher for the current year  The consensus estimate for RDWR has also been on a downward trend over the same time period too  as the estimate has fallen from  0 26 share two months ago to just  0 09 share today 
If this wasn t enough  Radware also has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  which puts it into unfortunate company among its peers  So  given all of these factors  investors may want to consider exiting this stock now before it falls back to Earth ",2016-06-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/radware-(rdwr)-is-overbought:-is-a-drop-coming-200133718,200133718

21635,243150,RDWR,Here s Why Radware  RDWR  Stock Soared Today,opinion,"Shares of Radware Ltd    NASDAQ RDWR   closed Tuesday trading with a 7 46  gain to  16 57 per share after posting a loss of  4 1 million in its first quarter 
The Israel based company is a leading provider of cyber security and application delivery solutions  The company reported  48 9 million in revenues for the first quarter of 2017  up 1  from a year ago  While sales in the Americas region dropped 8 5  from last year  the gap was made up by the 16 1  and 1 1  revenue growth from the EMEA and APAC regions  respectively 
Following the earnings report  Radware received a  Buy  upgrade from Dougherty   Company  The firm s analyst justified the rating upgrade on the earnings beat and more importantly  the new one year plan to buy back  40 million worth of shares 
Radware s revenue figures beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  47 9 million 
 We are pleased with the trends underlying the results for the first quarter and with the positive momentum that continued into the second quarter   said Roy Zisapel  Radware President   CEO   Positioning us well to meet our plans for 2017  
The company is looking to repurchase up to  40 million of its issued and outstanding ordinary shares by the end of 2017  On the one hand  the company could believe its stock is undervalued  and it will grow much stronger in the future  By purchasing now at a lower price  then releasing them again at a higher market price  the company will be able to make a return 
On the other hand  buying back the company s shares is an easy way to make the business look more attractive to investors  By reducing the number of shares  the company s earnings per share automatically go up  which attracts short term investors 
The revenue beat and sales growth in the EMEA and APAC regions certainly explained the company s and Dougherty s confidence in the future  However  whether you are a short term or long term investor  you should be cautious and pay attention to any sudden movement to the market

21637,243152,RDWR,5 Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy On Simmering US Iran Tensions  ,opinion,On Jun 21  news emerged that a day earlier the United States Cyber Command had carried out online attacks on Iranian targets  The operation  first revealed by a report from Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  News  was carried out on the same when President Trump decided not to go ahead with military strikes against Iran  The attacks were retaliation for Iran s destruction of an American surveillance drone The choice of cyberwarfare as low level response opens up a whole new world of possibilities  Iran s ability to retaliate in kind has improved radically over the last decade   This would only boost the demand for cybersecurity solutions among U S  companies of all sizes  Investing in these stocks from this sector would make for a smart choice now Cyberattacks Replace Military Strikes on IranOn Jun 21  President Trump said that he had called off the military attack on Iran 10 minutes before the strike because he thought that it would be a disproportionate response  Trump said on Jun 22 that he was  getting a lot of praise  for averting an attack  which would have caused multiple deaths Instead  the United States decided to press ahead with online attacks  planned carefully over the past few weeks  They were a response to both the downing of the American drone as well as the tanker attacks that took place earlier this month A number of systems were targeted  including an Iranian intelligence group  which apparently helped in planning the attacks on tankers in the Strait of Hormuz  Other targets include computer systems  which control the launch stages of Iranian missiles Retaliation Likely  Cybersecurity Stocks to GainInvestors should keep in mind that the threat of Iranian retaliation to these cyberattacks is both real and credible  Iran s capability in this area has improved considerably over the last decade as borne out by the attacks on American banks in 2012 and 2013  In fact  Iran s cyber forces has had years of experience in attacking U S  targets  including the attack on a Las Vegas Casino in 2015 It comes as no surprise then that cybersecurity stocks will gain in an environment already brimming with online threats  The Prime Cyber Security ETF  HACK  is already up 17 9  year to date  evidence of the field s growing importance in corporate America  As cyberattacks grow  spending on cybersecurity will only increase Another reason for changing security priorities is the growing popularity of cloud computing  As more and more companies embrace this trend  legacy security solutions such as antiviruses and firewalls are losing market share to cloud based options such as Web security gateways  This is likely to spark off a new trend of spending on fresh cybersecurity options Our ChoicesThe American attack on Iranian computer systems is perhaps the first shot fired into cyberspace in the ongoing conflict between the two countries  Likely retaliation will further boost spending on cybersecurity by U S  companies  Cloud based options will gain the most from this trend as they seem to represent the future Investing in cybersecurity
