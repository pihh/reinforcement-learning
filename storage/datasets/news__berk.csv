5723,227238,BERK,Coca Cola  bowing to pressure  amends employee equity plan,news,"By Devika Krishna Kumar and Anjali Athavaley   Reuters    Coca Cola Co  facing criticism from Warren Buffett and other investors for its outsized employee share rewards  said it had adopted new guidelines that would limit its stock compensation plan and improve transparency   The company said its new guidelines would extend the number of years award shares will last  formalize its practice of share repurchases to minimize dilution and renew commitments to open dialogue with shareholders on compensation matters   About 83 16 percent of shareholders voted for the company s 2014 equity plan when it came up for renewal in April  according to a Coca Cola filing following the company s annual meeting   However  the approval figure included a significant number of shareholders who had abstained from the vote  according to Reuters calculations   Buffett  whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc holds 9 1 percent of Coca Cola and is the company s biggest shareholder  was among those who abstained   The billionaire said in an interview with Bloomberg that while he considered the plan to be  excessive  he did not vote against it out of loyalty to the company    But it has been Wintergreen Advisers  which owns less than 1 percent of Coca Cola on behalf of clients  which has been the most vocal critic of the company s equity plan  saying it greatly diluted the holdings of current shareholders    Coca Cola has finally conceded that the equity compensation plan it put to a vote of shareholders in April was outrageously excessive and inconsistent with past plans   Wintergreen Chief Executive David Winters said in an emailed statement on Wednesday    No amount of backtracking by the Coca Cola board of directors can hide the fact that we believe it tried to sneak one by shareholders in Coca Cola s proxy materials and statements at the April shareholder meeting   he added   Wintergreen said in September that proxy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that funds managed by State Street  Fidelity and Capital Group voted against the plan    It looks to be a very unique approach to tell shareholders how the shares under this equity plan will be used with a great deal of responsibility  while addressing the criticisms about the plan from Berkshire as well as the other shareholders   Frank Glassner  chief executive of Veritas Executive Compensation Consultants  told Reuters   Under the new guidelines  Coke s compensation committee will limit the grants under the equity plan to an annual  burn rate  of no more than 0 8 percent in 2015  The burn rate refers to the number of shares granted as a percentage of outstanding shares   The guidelines will also facilitate a shift toward performance shares and be less heavily weighted toward stock options    We consider the shift positive in that it means lower  automatic  payout of equity   Stifel analysts wrote in a note   Coca Cola said it expected shares authorized under the equity plan to last the full term of 10 years   
Coca Cola shares were down 0 3 percent at  42 55 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange     Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in Bangalore and Anjali Athavaley in New York  Editing by Simon Jennings and Ted Kerr ",2014-10-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/coca-cola-amends-equity-plan-to-minimize-dilution-311493,311493

you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call  With me this morning are Jamie Moses  our CFO  Sean Gray  our president  Georgia Melas  our chief credit officer  and George Bacigalupo  our commercial leader  I ll begin the call with a high level overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Jamie to go deeper into our numbers  We ended the year on a very strong note  We delivered  0 70 in core EPS  Our core profitability metrics were the highest of the year  Our GAAP EPS came in at  0 51  including merger and other identified noncore charges  We completed the systems integration of Connecticut and Rhode Island operations from the SI Financial acquisition on time and on budget  and our integrated teams are working very well together  We made further progress with the four initiatives from our strategic review we set out earlier this year  We completed the sale of approximately  80 million of acquired non relationship commercial loans   50 million of which were aircraft loans  We continue to receive expressions of interest on the remaining balance of the aircraft portfolio  which was moved from our held for sale back into our C I portfolio  We released  300 million in less strategic investments in loans  and we used the proceeds to reduce higher cost wholesale funding  which is down  900 million from the beginning of the year  Our efficiency project reduced core expense by 3  compared to the third quarter  and we repurchased 815 000 shares  keeping us on track with the utilization of our 2 4 million share buyback authorization  Our measures of capital liquidity improved steadily throughout the year  Our year end asset quality numbers remained strong  and we believe that our asset quality is solid and properly diversified  Our business focus is based on relationships  risk and return  Reduction in total loans is consistent with our strategy  and we re well placed to serve existing and prospective relationships in our markets going forward  We promoted eight of our high level officers to the new position of regional president to serve our eight regional markets  These proven leaders will drive our market positioning  enhance our performance and maintain active community leadership roles  Reporting to bank President Sean Gray  in these roles  they will engage with community stakeholders and lead our top priority efforts around our Be FIRST values and our commitment to being a 21st century community bank  With that  I ll ask Jamie to take us through some of the numbers  Jamie Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Richard  Our  0 70 in core EPS was up quarter over quarter and year over year  We had  0 19 in net noncore charges for the quarter  resulting in  0 51 of GAAP EPS  I ll discuss the major noncore items later in my comments  Our core ROA reached 108 basis points in the fourth quarter  and our core return on tangible common equity was a little over 13   The GAAP ROA was 78 basis points and GAAP ROE was around 6   We accomplished our goal to offset the operating EPS impact of lower purchase accounting accretion  We did this despite the unanticipated impact from three Fed funds interest rate cuts  We ve been modestly asset sensitive and SI Financial was also asset sensitive  I ll address the margin impact shortly  But just to note here that this has been another headwind that we faced in boosting our operating profitability through the year  Moving to the balance sheet  Our assets declined in the fourth quarter as we pursued our strategic initiatives and reduced wholesale funding  Our original objective was to reduce footings by a little more than  1 billion over the medium term by releasing investments in loans with less strategic value  We estimate that we ve accomplished about  700 million of that asset reduction in 2019  including  300 million in the fourth quarter  These are assets with less relationship and return benefits  and we expect to see continued reduction toward our target in 2020  Retail time deposits decreased modestly in the fourth quarter as interest rates declined  We re focused on managing our deposit costs and we won t retain excess deposits if they become uneconomic due to competitive factors  We re targeting modest retail deposit growth in 2020  excluding fluctuating payroll balances  Year end 2019 payroll balances totaled  744 million  much of which was held overnight in short term investments  We reduced our average funding cost by nine basis points in the fourth quarter  including a seven basis point reduction in deposit costs  Wholesale funds were reduced by more than  400 million during the quarter  and by around  900 million for the year  We expect to further reduce our wholesale funding this year  Our capital metrics continue to improve  even as we repurchased around 815 000 shares in the fourth quarter  which brings our total buybacks to 1 7 million shares for the year  At year end  we had an additional 700 000 shares remaining in our buyback authorization  which expires on March 31  On January 2  half of the outstanding preferred shares were converted to about 540 000 common shares based on the two for one formula in the shareholder agreement  This will have no impact on EPS and will slightly boost book value per common share  Moving on to the income statement  Quarterly accretion benefit to EPS was equal to  0 07 in the most recent quarter  unchanged from the linked quarter and down from  0 13 on a year over year basis  We expect this benefit to decrease further as we move through 2020  Setting aside the impact of accretion  the net interest margin tightened by 12 basis points quarter over quarter and by 17 basis points year over year  The majority of the year s compression was due to the impact of lower rates on our asset sensitive balance sheet along with the impact of competitive market pricing conditions  Based on the current forward curve  we expect a margin before accretion to stabilize around current levels and expand from there as we continue to execute on our balance sheet strategies in 2020  Due to our asset reduction strategies  we expect the quarterly net interest income run rate to decrease in the low single digits compared to Q4 results  Fee income benefited from a strong quarter from our SBA lending team  which had a record year for sale premiums  Separately  we also recorded gains on the sale of a portion of our aircraft portfolio  as well as an acquired commercial portfolio from SI Financial  Looking forward  we expect fee income to increase modestly in the back half of the year  Moving to the provision  as Richard noted  the loan portfolio s condition is sound  The major item for 2020 is the new CECL accounting standard  Now like most banks  we anticipate that the allowance for our performing loans will increase under this new standard under the new life of loan methodology with an offset to equity  but little regulatory capital impact  As you know  due to our acquisitions and taking into consideration our acquired taxi medallion loans  we have a comparatively large discount on purchased credit impaired loans  We expect that the gross loan balance will increase due to the removal of this discount with an initial offsetting increase in the allowance  This transfer may impact metrics related to revenue  margins  efficiency  loan risk classifications  loan charge offs and regulatory capital  Purchase loan recoveries that are presently posted to net interest income will be posted to the allowance and generally are expected to reduce provision expense with little net impact to the bottom line  We expect to have more guidance on these impacts after we complete our financial statements  Moving on to noninterest expense  We brought in further targeted cost saves in Q4  and we reduced total noncore expense by 3  quarter over quarter  Year over year  fourth quarter core expense was essentially flat despite our acquisition of a  1 7 billion bank  which previously had a  10 million quarterly expense run rate  Our efficiency ratio came in a little under 54   And we expect to see some expense growth in 2020 as we invest in our team and franchise  and the FDIC insurance rebates that showed up in the back half of 2019 will not continue  We  therefore  expect the annualized run rate of expenses to increase over fourth quarter levels  and we expect a tax rate in the area of 20  in 2020  compared to the 18  core tax rate in Q4  Looking forward  our Q1 EPS is expected to be down seasonally compared to our fourth quarter run rate  which includes the impact of payroll taxes and higher winter occupancy costs  Additionally  the benefit from the FDIC rebates and loan sale gains are not expected to repeat  Our first quarter 2020 core EPS may be flat or slightly down from last year s first quarter  and then we ll look for improvements going forward from there  Our core ROA was 93 basis points in 2019  we will improve on this in 2020  with most of the pickup anticipated in the back half of the year  Our national mortgage banking operations which are held for sale are classified as discontinued operations in the financial statements  We continue to actively pursue sale options  These operations generated a loss in the fourth quarter  which is a seasonally lower quarter for residential mortgage volume  Moving to merger charges  These were related to the SI Financial acquisition and are complete  These charges came in within our original estimates  The restructuring charges were mostly related to the strategic initiatives that we pursued this year  We consolidated eight branch offices during the year  including two in the fourth quarter  We don t anticipate that there will be noncore related items going forward  aside from discontinued operations until the sale is complete  I ll close by summarizing that our profitability and conditions have improved following the first quarter  and we re ending the year positioned in line with the guidance and plans that we set out at the start of the year  Our strategies have generated higher quality  more sustainable earnings streams this year and will continue to do so  With that  I ll turn the call back over to Richard Richard Marotta    Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Jamie  I ll touch on a couple more topics to conclude our prepared remarks  Our company earned two very significant recognitions recently  that I m very proud of  one  we received a U S  Chamber of Commerce Award for Top Corporate Stewardship  and two  we were also added to the Bloomberg Equality Index  which tracks companies committed to supporting gender equality  We also opened up our first Reevx Labs co working space  which we located in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston  We ll be gradually expanding the Reevx Labs in other urban markets with underbanked minority communities  We believe that our actions distinguish our team and enterprise  That our communities value a partner committed to building a just and prosperous future based on our values of diversity and inclusion  Lastly  I m pleased to note that our shareholders received a 26  total stock return in 2019  We increased our dividend by 5  in 2019 and are announcing now a 4  increase in 2020  We repurchased shares to return excess equity to our owners  we re gratified by these returns and we ll continue to focus on strengthening our franchise and building a 21st century community bank with our focus on purpose driven performance  With that  I ll ask the operator to open up the lines for any questions  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  Our first question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon with Piper Sandler Mark Fitzgibbon    Piper Sandler    Analyst Hey  guys Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Good morning  Mark Mark Fitzgibbon    Piper Sandler    Analyst I m doing good  Thanks  One question  Jamie  that  1 35 million gain on business operations  was that related to the commercial aircraft business or something else Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Yes  No  That s the  80 million in commercial sales that Richard spoke about   50 million of which was the commercial aircraft Mark Fitzgibbon    Piper Sandler    Analyst OK  Gotcha  And then on expense growth  I know you said you expected expenses to grow a bit in 2020 as you invest in the franchise  can you give us some sense of the magnitude of that growth  Is it 2   3 ish kind of percent Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer I think that s probably a good starting place  Mark  I think that s probably an area where we might be Mark Fitzgibbon    Piper Sandler    Analyst OK  And I guess it looked like headcount was down about 12  year over year  are we at the bottom  And when do you think restructuring charges and sort of noise related to the restructuring is likely to be completed Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Yes  So I think we are at the bottom of that  And the restructuring noise  especially in those lines there that you see on F 9 and 10  that s done  Fourth quarter is the last time we ll have that  The only noncore things that we ll see in the future are the discontinued operations that we have on the balance sheet  and as soon as the FCLS sale is complete  and the FCLS employees are gone and off the books  then we ll have just sort of a very clean financials at that point Mark Fitzgibbon    Piper Sandler    Analyst OK  And I know  Jamie  you said that you re going to give more color after the filings come out  but I m just wondering if you can help us think about the provisioning line for this year  Any guidance at all you could provide would be really helpful Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Yes  So I mean  I guess  I kind of    think about it this way  We ve been running like a  4 million to  5 million roughly  quarterly run rate in the provision  I expect the provision line to go down to around  2 million or so a quarter  maybe even just a little bit less than that  But that s going to be due to the fact that accretion and recovery income that we ve gotten in the past that showed up in net interest income goes directly to the allowance now  and so those will be offsetting things in the future Mark Fitzgibbon    Piper Sandler    Analyst Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Dave Bishop with D A  Davidson Dave Bishop    D A  Davidson Companies    Analyst Good morning  gentlemen Richard Marotta    Chief Executive Officer How are you Dave Bishop    D A  Davidson Companies    Analyst How are you doing  Richard Richard Marotta    Chief Executive Officer Good Dave Bishop    D A  Davidson Companies    Analyst Just a quick question from a holistic basis  the promotions you noted there  How should we think about that in terms of maybe just the overall operating strategy  Is there    is that sort of a revamped focus on sort of the community banking efforts  And does that sort of change your view in terms of the types of loans and deposit relationships you re going after moving forward Richard Marotta    Chief Executive Officer I don t think I could have answered that question better than you just    you kind of alluded to  I think it s getting back to the community bank roots  And so with the regional presidents and dealing with the stakeholders within the community  it s really going to drive us closer to the communities  and that will in itself start to move us into business banking  into deposits and those kinds of items  So it gets us more entrenched in our community Dave Bishop    D A  Davidson Companies    Analyst Got it  And as we think about just overall balance sheet growth  I think  Jamie  you said probably it has some additional runoff in the first quarter or so  Do you think we see growth in that footings in terms of loans by the end of the year Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer I think we    I think that s possible  Dave  That s going to be determined on how well we can gather core deposits  As we ve said  our core deposit growth is going to be sort of the governor on our loan growth  And so depending on how that goes will depend on the size of the balance sheet  really Dave Bishop    D A  Davidson Companies    Analyst Got it  And I think I heard you say  Jamie  that the current authorization expires the end of March  saw the dividend increase  do you think there s a good likelihood that you reup the share repurchase program following this Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer I think    guys are looking at me  I m probably not supposed to say this to you  I think that we    I think there is a good chance  depending on conditions that we would actually pursue a further share buyback authorization Dave Bishop    D A  Davidson Companies    Analyst Yes  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Collyn Gilbert with KBW Collyn Gilbert    KBW    Analyst Thanks  Good morning  gentlemen  Jamie  if we could start with the NIM  I just want to make sure I m understanding this all correctly  So if you    so if we exclude accretion income this quarter  it was like 2 91   And when you re giving your NIM guidance for relative stabilization  it s off that 2 91  base  correct Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer So we have it as 2 94  ex accretion NIM  Collyn  But yes  that is the guidance off of that number Collyn Gilbert    KBW    Analyst OK  So just curious  as you    and you had indicated that you thought maybe in the back half of the year that that could start to expand  Can you just talk a little bit about some of the dynamics that you re seeing there  I know there s a lot of movement  which I don t know if I should ask my loan growth dynamic question first or the NIM question  But    and then kind of  yes  so where you re seeing some of the asset yield settling out now that we back out the full effect of the accretion in those yields  And then kind of the trajectory on some of the funding pickup or improvement Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Perfect  So the forward curve right now  we re anticipating the way we re thinking about it  there s no rate increases  more cuts expected over this year  And so the real dynamics that drive an accretive NIM are simply the strategies that we ve laid out over the past year now  which is to get out of less strategic and non relationship assets that are on our books  and by doing that  we also decreased our reliance on wholesale funding  So I think as we re thinking about those things  that s really going to be the driver of the accretion to the NIM in the back half of the year  I also think that first quarter alluded to it a little bit  but I think first quarter is going to stabilize right around where we re at today  and then we should expand going forward  As we trim lower yielding  less relationship assets and pay down the wholesale funding that that s on the books Collyn Gilbert    KBW    Analyst OK  So you re anticipating a benefit on both the asset and funding side going forward Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Yes  I guess  I would say  I guess  it s mostly on the funding side of things  right  Rates are lower  So I m not sure that we re going to see an expansion of asset yields  But I think that on the    the reduction of the    reduction of those assets should reduce our funding costs  which will be the driver of the NIM Collyn Gilbert    KBW    Analyst OK  And before I move to the growth dynamics  let me just    in terms of the results this quarter  I think on the core NIM fell a little bit short of where your guidance was  Was there    just curious  was it the timing on the funding side  Or what caused sort of that variance from what you guys were thinking going into the quarter Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer The main variance between what we thought we were going to be and where we re at is  we have an increase    a substantial increase in short term investments that is generally driven by a change in the way the liquidity dynamics that we re employing as part of the payroll deposits  And so instead of taking down funding  we re actually funding short term balances in the investment portfolio  which had essentially no effect on EPS  but did hurt the NIM by about four basis points  So we expect that    we don t expect there to be a change in that going forward  So that reduction of four basis points sort of holds into this quarter  and then we ll expect to expand based on our strategies going forward Collyn Gilbert    KBW    Analyst OK  OK  That s helpful  And then just on the loan side  So it looks like held for sale went down  But did you put    and you    but you sold  80 million  Did you    was there movement that came back into the balance sheet  And maybe just if we could give us a little bit of color as kind of when you talk about expectation for loan growth off of what number or what base Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Yes  exactly  So we moved our  110 million of the aircraft portfolio back into the commercial line from the held for sale bucket  We are not actively marketing that portfolio at this moment  From time to time  as Richard noted in his comments  we still receive expressions of interest from people on that  And so we are still open to selling portions of or the entire aircraft portfolio  But again  that will be economic driven versus just to say we re out of that business kind of thing  So we will make sure that we would expect to get a gain on anything that happened in that portfolio in terms of a sale Collyn Gilbert    KBW    Analyst OK  And then your expectation for absolute growth going forward is what on the loan side Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Well  like I said  I think  yes  I think we re still in a little bit of flat to down a little bit this year  as we re trying to trim our wholesale funding  We re down to just about    just a little over  2 billion in wholesale funding right now  Goal is to minimize our wholesale funding as much as possible  and I think as I look at it big picture  it really continues to be a function of our ability to gather core deposits on whether or not the loan portfolio can expand Richard Marotta    Chief Executive Officer Yes  Collyn  this is Richard  It really isn t a product of not having a robust pipeline or our folks not having the connections in the community  It s really a function of us being more picky and choosy to get the wholesale funding piece of it down  As we said before  as Jamie said before  it s really the wholesale funding that s really got to move and stabilize the NIM Collyn Gilbert    KBW    Analyst OK  OK  And then just on OPEX  Jamie  I appreciate kind of the guidance here  but I just was curious about some of the moving parts of that  So this quarter  it looked like occupancy shot up quite a bit  and I know that usually  first quarter is seasonally higher with that line  So just trying to understand the dynamic there  And then marketing expense  too  it seemed like that was a pretty big delta  but just curious as to what may have impacted those    the quarter results on those two lines Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Yes  sure  So what you see in the occupancy and equipment line going up that much  That was    we had actually a reclassification quarter over quarter of some technology expenses in the  400 000 to  500 000 range  So that s really    that s the large majority of that drive up in occupancy  in addition to the    just    occupancy just costs a little bit more in the winter months  We had made some investments in technology in the fourth quarter  So that s where you re seeing the    that s where you re seeing that the occupancy and equipment line going up like that  And then you have    I m sorry  you had    there were other line   Collyn Gilbert    KBW    Analyst Marketing  I was just curious about marketing expense seemed like that there was a delta there and just the outlook on that line Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Yes  I mean  I think that that marketing line is    should be relatively stable  maybe up a little bit in Q1  But I think that should be relatively stable going forward  The occupancy expense in Q1 will be slightly higher seasonally as well  So just wanted to mention that to you  too Collyn Gilbert    KBW    Analyst OK  And then just lastly  on the first choice sale  do you have a sense of timing on that Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer That s a great question  I don t    I mean  I don t think I can really give any more guidance than I have on that at this moment  other than to say that we continue to be engaged with potential partners in our attempts to get out of that business Collyn Gilbert    KBW    Analyst All right  I will leave it there  Thanks  guys OperatorOur next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker with Compass Point Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    Analyst Hi  Good morning  Just wanted to go back to  I guess  loan growths and loan goals  just to the extent that you can chat a little bit more about it  So a year ago  you lay out plans to sell the aircraft book  Basically  I just want to make sure I heard you right  So the  110 million is back in the C I that you re not actively marketing now for sale  So there is nothing else to sell in the aircraft book  is that correct Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer I wouldn t say it that way  I would say that we were able to execute on a chunk of that portfolio at the economics that we require in order for that to happen  And from time to time  we have other folks interested in it  So I don t think we re    I m not counting on selling the rest of that portfolio  but I wouldn t rule it out either Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    Analyst OK  Great  And then the indirect  can you just give us an update on where that balance is in FICO  if you have it  And I know you ceased originating  but how you re thinking about that book as we head into  20 Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Yes  So we re going to continue to run that balance down as we go forward  Yes  Sean  Go ahead  yes Sean Gray    President The current portfolio balance is  361 million  We saw about  45 million in Q4 net runoff  expect a three  to four year total runoff time frame Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    Analyst OK  And your FICO on that  it s in the low sevens  is that right Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Yes Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    Analyst OK  And then the Taxi  where does that stand at the moment  I mean  I know it s small  Last we heard  it was around  24 million  Do you have an update on that Georgia Melas    Chief Credit Officer Yes  Laurie  it s Georgia  Taxi Medallion portfolio is about  22 5 million  So it s down another  1 5 million from last quarter Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    Analyst OK  Great  And are there any other loan categories that you re identifying when you think about loan growth as being flat to down  Are there any other categories that you re identifying and saying  hey  we have to run this down or this is not a focus  How should we think about that  Maybe asked a different way  I guess  what categories are we likely going to see growth in 2020  Where is the focus Richard Marotta    Chief Executive Officer Yes  I think you ll see growth in business banking just by definition of how we re approaching relationships and profitability  I think that would be the spot where you would see growth in 2020 Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    Analyst OK  And then do you have an update on the Firestone numbers  What the balance is  What the originations were  What the charge offs were  And then maybe also  generally  with CECL  are you thinking about that loan book any differently Georgia Melas    Chief Credit Officer Well  Laurie  it s Georgia again  The outstandings at the end of the quarter were  268 million  Firestone had about  43 million originations for the quarter  and net charge offs for the quarter were just a little over  300 000 Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    Analyst OK  Great  And then do you have the number of substandard  Comparatively  last quarter  your substandard loans stood at  166 million  I mean for the total loan book  not for Firestone  Do you have a substandard number  And then   Georgia Melas    Chief Credit Officer Yes  The substandard at the end of the year was  162 million Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    Analyst OK  That s great  OK  And then just going back over to deposits  Looks like your cost of core came down really nicely in the quarter  as did your total  How do we think about that in terms of  I guess  both growth and then how you re thinking about where you can bring that  And I guess  specifically  your loan to deposit ratio is now sitting at 92   how are you thinking about that Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer Yes  So I think that the cost of deposits can and will continue to come down  As you know  it takes a little bit of time for the rate cuts to work through on the deposit side of things as specials roll off  as time deposits roll off  when rates come down  So I think we can improve that substantially on the deposit side of things  And then    and again  same for total funding costs as well  I think that that comes down pretty good over time  And then there was    you had one other question there  Laurie  I m sorry I   Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    Analyst I mean  I guess  just how we should be thinking about the growth in the deposit    I mean I know you said  obviously  the growth in the loans is very tied to what you re doing in the deposits  I mean  I guess  asked another way  if we re looking at deposits  how would we expect to see deposit growth play out in  20 Jamie Moses    Chief Financial Officer I think we re looking for modest core deposit growth in 2020  I think we re looking at 1  to 2  or so in 2020 Richard Marotta    Chief Executive Officer We re going to continue to be disciplined in our approach  the same way we are with the loan side and we re going to continue to work our branch optimization strategy  So 1 of the things I think we executed well on is in closing 8 branches to maintain 95 plus deposits really drove that expense number down for us  allowed us to leverage our MyBanker program  which we feel we
