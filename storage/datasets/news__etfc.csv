151981,373497,ETFC,Charles Schwab to buy TD Ameritrade in  26 billion blockbuster brokerage deal,news,"By C Nivedita
 Reuters     Charles Schwab  Corp  N SCHW  agreed on Monday to buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp  O AMTD  in an all stock deal valued at  26 billion  creating a brokerage giant in a market that has been ravaged by price wars 
The acquisition will shake up the retail brokerage industry  creating a company with  5 trillion in assets under management and putting smaller rivals under pressure to scout for tie ups 
The discount brokerage business is under pressure from new  nimbler startups that are gaining market share by eliminating commissions on stock trades 
Last month  Schwab became the first major brokerage to eliminate commissions  a move followed by others including Fidelity Investments  E Trade Financial Corp  O ETFC  and TD Ameritrade 
 In a low  or no fees world     the pressure will be on other financial services rivals to try to keep up  or to gain further scale themselves   Bankrate com senior economic analyst Mark Hamrick said 
While the deal could give Schwab an edge in the price war  analysts and anti trust experts said the merger would face tough regulatory scrutiny  although it could still be approved 
 The industry will continue to have large players and we won t think it will derail a deal   said Stephen Biggar  director of financial institutions research at Argus Research 
The combined company will have about 65  to 70  of investment account assets  according to a note from KBW last week 
TERMS OF THE DEAL
As part of the deal  expected to close in the second half of 2020  Ameritrade stockholders will get 1 0837 Schwab shares for every share held  or  52 23 based on Schwab s Friday close 
TD Ameritrade shares rose as much as 7 6  to  51 80 in morning trading  They have surged 25  since Wednesday  a day before CNBC first reported on the talks 
TD Ameritrade  whose CEO Tim Hockey was due to step down in February  suspended its CEO search and named Chief Financial Officer Stephen Boyle as interim head to lead the company s proposed integration 
CNBC had reported that the combined company was expected to be led by Schwab s chief executive officer  Walt Bettinger 




Schwab shareholders will hold 69  of the combined company  while TD Ameritrade stockholders will have an 18  stake  The remaining roughly 13  stake will be held by  Toronto Dominion Bank   TO TD   TD Ameritrade s largest shareholder ",2019-11-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/charles-schwab-to-buy-td-ameritrade-in-26billion-blockbuster-brokerage-deal-2027263,2027263

152043,373559,ETFC,Schwab s Buyout Of TD Ameritrade To Shake Up Online Brokerage,opinion,Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW   has inked an all stock deal to acquire TD Ameritrade Holding   TSX TD   for roughly  26 billion  This will create a behemoth in online brokerage space with combined client assets worth more than  5 trillion and serving nearly 24 million brokerage accounts Schwab President and CEO Walt Bettinger said   With this transaction  we will capitalize on the unique opportunity to build a firm with the soul of a challenger and the resources of a large financial services institution that will be uniquely positioned to serve the investment  trading and wealth management needs of investors across every phase of their financial journeys  Exchange Ratio  New Headquarter   Other DetailsUnder the deal terms  shareholders of TD Ameritrade will receive 1 0837 Schwab shares for each TD Ameritrade share  This represents a 17  premium over the 30 day volume weighted average price exchange ratio as of Nov 20  2019 The transaction  still subject to regulatory approvals and consent of shareholders of both the companies  is expected to close in the second half of 2020  The integration process will start immediately thereafter  which is likely to take around 18 36 months As part of this process  the combined company s headquarter will be shifted to Westlake  TX from Schwab s current base in San Francisco  Nearly  1 6 billion charge related to the integration is expected to be incurred over three years after closing The deal has been approved by the board of directors of both the companies as well as the Strategic Development Committee of TD Ameritrade s board  formed to supervise and conduct the process and all negotiations concerning the transaction  Following the deal closure  The Toronto Dominion Bank   TSX TD    which has nearly 43  stake in TD Ameritrade at present  is likely to have an ownership position of roughly 13  in the combined company  Other TD Ameritrade stockholders and existing Schwab stockholders will hold approximately 18  and 69  stake  respectively Moreover  TD Bank will have two new seats on the combined company s board  while TD Ameritrade will have one Further  TD Ameritrade has halted previously announce process of searching for new CEO and named Stephen Boyle  the company s EVP and CFO  as interim President and CEO Accretive to Earnings  Cost SynergiesThe deal is expected to result in substantial strategic benefits for the combined firm  Also  clients of both Schwab and TD Ameritrade will benefit from enhancement of  investing and trading experience  Boyle said   Partnering with Schwab on this transformative opportunity makes the right strategic and financial sense for TD Ameritrade  The deal is expected to be single digit percentage accretive to operating cash earnings in the first year post closing and 15 20  accretive in the third year  Further  it is projected to be 10 15  accretive to GAAP earnings in the third year  post completion Also  the deal is estimated to result in  3 5  4 0 billion in total synergies  This will be mainly derived from expense savings and the Insured Deposit Account renegotiation transaction between Schwab and TD Bank On cost front  the current projection is for nearly  1 8  2 billion run rate expense synergies  representing about 18 20  of combined company s cost base  A part of this synergy is expected to be realized from  elimination of overlapping and duplicative roles  More synergies are likely to be generated through real estate  administrative and other savings  Nonetheless  no details related to these were provided at present Overall  all these are anticipated to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of client assets and help further diversify revenues  Notably  the deal is expected to increase percentage of trading related fees to total revenues to about 19  from nearly 9  for Schwab at present Our TakeA deal as big as this is likely to face a fair share of hurdles  Further  as two of the biggest online brokers are involved  the transaction could face tough antitrust scrutiny  The transaction is likely to hit the competitive position of the likes of E Trade Financial   NASDAQ ETFC    Fidelity Investments and Interactive Brokers Nonetheless  Bettinger downplayed the antitrust risks for the deal  In the conference call following the announcement  he said   We have numerous competitors  many of which are far larger than us today and far larger than a combined organization  They re going to continue to come right after us  as they are now in all aspects of the business  Further  investors seem to be bullish on the announcement  Shares of both the companies have been rallying since last week when the news related to deal talks hit the markets  Shares of Schwab and TD Ameritrade are up 10 2  and 25 1  since then At the time when the online broker industry is going through massive disruptions  the deal seems to be a way forward  It was only last month that all major industry players had begun offering commission free trading  with Schwab leading  This are expected to hurt the companies trading fees   Read more   This  coupled with lower interest rates  will continue to put strain on net interest margins  So  consolidation seems like an apt move to overcome the challenging operating backdrop and diversify revenues Earlier in July  Schwab had announced a deal to acquire certain assets of USAA s Investment Management Company  including brokerage and managed portfolio accounts  The all cash deal  valued at  1 8 billion  to be funded by available corporate cash   is expected close in 2020 Currently  both Schwab and TD Ameritrade carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  5 Stocks Set to

152095,373611,ETFC,Shockwave Hits Brokerage Firms After Charles Schwab Slashes Commissions,opinion,"Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW   sent a shockwave through the investment bank industry after it announced that they would be slashing their commission fees to zero  The investment firm announced on Tuesday that starting October 7th  they will be eliminating their trading commission fees for US stocks  ETFs  and options 
Charles Schwab shares closed down 9 73   TD Ameritrade   NASDAQ AMTD   closed in the red by a whopping 25 83  for its worst day in 13 years  and E Trade   NASDAQ ETFC   ended their day down over 16   Founder and chairman  Charles Schwab  commented in a press release that the firm s  passion has been to make investing easier and more affordable for everyone  after the announcement  
Why Cut  
The equity and fund trading landscape has changed substantially in recent years after the Silicon Valley startup  Robinhood  offered free stock trading back in 2013  Many investors were stoked at the opportunity to trade equities freely without having to account for trading commission costs  Charles Schwab s decision to eliminate commissions comes after their competitor  Interactive Brokers   NYSE IBKR    announced last Thursday that their new product called IBKR Lite would allow users to trade US stocks and ETFs commission free 
Founded in 2012  Robinhood has garnered around 6 million users  many of them millennials  with its smartphone app that allows users to buy and sell stocks without fees  A Robinhood spokesman stated  the changes taking place across the brokerage industry reflect a focus on the customer that s been inherent to Robinhood since the beginning   How do brokerages like Robinhood make money  They rely heavily on a practice called  payment for order flow  in which they route customers looking to buy or sell equities to electronic trading firms like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial   NASDAQ VIRT   
The evolving trading landscape has led financial giants like JPMorgan   NYSE JPM   to play along  The banking giant announced their You Invest product last year that was aimed at younger  first time traders and offered customers at least 100 free stock or ETF trades a year  Charles Schwab CFO Peter Crawford said in a note on the company s website that  It has seemed inevitable that commissions would head towards zero  so why wait  
Moving Forward 
Brokerage firms have already been hurting this year because of falling stock trading volumes as concerns over slowed economic growth have run rampant throughout the market  The interest rate cuts dealt by the Federal Reserve in their July and September meetings have also hurt brokerages by cutting into their ability to collect interest on clients  cash  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   analysts expressed concern about the brokerage industry  stating   We were hoping the challenging macro environment would prevent the industry from competing on price like this  but that is clearly not what is happening  
Charles Schwab may be better positioned to weather the storm as it is more reliant on their banking arm and less dependent on commissions  Commission fees make up about 7  of total revenue for Charles Schwab while commission fees contribute about a quarter of TD Ameritrade s total revenue and roughly 20  of E Trade s net sales  The last time Charles Schwab lowered its commission fee was in February 2017  and assets under management grew from  2 92 trillion to the current  3 72 trillion  Time will tell which financial service companies can successfully adapt to the contemporary trading landscape  especially as millennials grow older and possess more purchasing power

152099,373615,ETFC,The Death Of A Stockbroker,opinion,"The world of investing has been evolving rapidly over the past 2 decades  and brokers  commissions continue to shrink  The latest development in the brokerage market is the move to commission free trading  The largest public e brokers in the US  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW    E Trade   NASDAQ ETFC    and TD Ameritrade   NASDAQ AMTD    announced last week that they would be offering no fee trades in a move that will change the investment landscape from here on out 
Evolution of Brokers
Stockbrokers used to be the kings of Wall Street  and one of the only ways that the common folk could invest their money into the markets  Stockbrokers would take a sizable chunk from every trade and risked nothing in doing so 
The internet age changed everything for the public equity market  Stocks transformed from being a slip declaring company ownership to a ticker on a screen  The digitizing stock market made trading as easy as a click of the mouse 
The internet has almost entirely eliminated the need for stockbrokers  Now anyone can buy and sell shares or even make more complicated trades with options using just their smartphones 
Robinhood s no fee  no minimum deposit product offering has driven the younger generation back into the equity markets  Millennials are tied to their smartphones  and Robinhood s mobile born application caters perfectly to new investors 
Robinhood has started a cultural shift in investing with the average account holding between  1 000 and  5 000  but over 4 million users  This platform has been able to take control of a sizable portion of the broker market 
Robinhood is a privately owned company that is backed by a number of venture capitalist companies  In its latest round of funding in July  the firm was valued at  7 6 billion  There have been rumors circulating that Robinhood is planning to go public soon  but nothing official has been announced 
Big broker stocks have all been getting destroyed this year as investors are more apt to take long positions in passive index funds as well as Robinhood s attractive  free  trading offering taking business  The race to the lowest trading fees is over as all the major brokers dropped commissions to zero last week 
Investors were not happy with this decision  and e broker stocks substantially sold off  Since the zero commission announcement SCHW is down 15   AMTD broke 27   and ETFC fell 15  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   E TRADE Financial Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   
The gap down that this announcement caused was icing on the cake of a disappointing year  Both SCHW and AMTD fell to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  after this announcement 
The brokers are hoping that this commission free structure will attract more customers and they will be able to profit on margin yields  idle cash  and premium features  It is all going to come down to product offerings  I see consolidation in this field moving forward and potentially larger downsides to the ones that aren t able to successfully acquire more market share 
Take Away
Free trading across the board is great news for retail investors like us  unless you own one of these brokerage stocks   This will likely also create more liquidity for stocks as more small investors enter the market  The barriers to enter the markets have dropped to zero  and an increasing number of millennials are dipping their toes in the financial markets

152100,373616,ETFC,ITG chair to step down after activist pressure  SEC fine,news,"By Michael Flaherty and John McCrank
NEW YORK  Reuters    Investment Technology Group  N ITG   which recently paid a record fine related to its  dark pool  trading venue  said on Monday the chair of its board  as well as a board director  would step down as the brokerage transitions to new leadership 
The moves come amid rising pressure from two activist funds  which have been agitating for changes at the brokerage  Voce Capital and Philadelphia Financial Management of San Francisco disclosed on Thursday that their collective ownership in the company increased to 8 6 percent from 6 3 percent  The filing said the funds intend to speak with the company s management team and board of directors 
On Monday  ITG said Maureen O Hara  who joined ITG s board in 2003 and has served as chair since 2007  will retire on Jan  15  2016  the same day that incoming Chief Executive Officer Frank Troise starts at the firm 
Troise most recently headed JP Morgan Execution Services  a global multi asset electronic execution group within the investment bank  N JPM  
Earlier this year  Voce and Philadelphia Financial Management  acting as a group  ramped up pressure on ITG and nominated a slate of three directors for the board ahead of its annual meeting  ITG and the activists reached an agreement in April  with the company adding a dissident director to the board   former E Trade Financial Corp  O ETFC  executive Jarrett Lilien  The company also said at the time that it agreed to review its capital allocation processes 
In August  ITG said it would pay  20 3 million to the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission to settle charges it ran a secret trading desk that profited from confidential customer information within its private stock trading venue  or  dark pool  
Voce Capital declined to comment on Monday  Philadelphia Financial Management did not immediately return a call seeking comment 

After the SEC charges  ITG fired its CEO  Bob Gasser  replacing him in the interim with Lilien 
 I have enjoyed my more than 12 years of service with the company  and along with my fellow directors have worked hard to bring ITG through a challenging year   O Hara said in a statement   I have been contemplating retirement for some time  but wanted to do so only when the company was well positioned for future success

152129,373645,ETFC,Brokerages Face SEC Probe On Retail Orders,news,"By    The Securities and Exchange Commission has sent out subpoenas and demands for records to brokerage companies as part of a probe into how retail customers  orders are routed  executed and filled  according to several people familiar with the matter 
The SEC s enforcement division is investigating whether retail customers are receiving the best price and the most efficient execution for their trades  these people said  The regulator is also asking about the payments that some retail brokers receive from exchanges and trading firms in exchange for directing customer orders to those platforms 
It s unclear which firms received the requests  though the people familiar with the matter said they were distributed widely  Some of the biggest retail brokerage companies are Charles Schwab Corp   TD Ameritrade Holding  Fidelity Investments  Fidelity Brokerage Services and E Trade Financial Corp  which can get paid  100 million a year or more for selling their orders 
The SEC s investigation comes as public debate has intensified over rules governing payment for order flow and other market structure issues that may favor high frequency traders over retail investors  spurred in part by Michael Lewis s  Flash Boys   a book that explores the rise and potential abuses of computer driven high speed trading 
Andrew Ceresney  the director of the SEC s enforcement division  declined to comment specifically on the recent flurry of data requests in an interview last week  but confirmed the SEC is generally looking at issues surrounding retail order flow 
 That is obviously an ongoing investigation   Ceresney said in the interview   I will say broadly  we are looking for abuses in this area  
SEC rules allow the practice of paying for order flow  as long as rebates are properly disclosed and rules about getting the best price in the shortest possible time are followed  The SEC has taken enforcement actions in recent years against firms including Scottrade and Morgan Stanley for improper disclosures and other violations regarding their routing of retail orders for securities 
The SEC is also asking the firms for evidence that they are engaging in a  rigorous review  of their routing practices to ensure they are achieving best execution  one of the people familiar with the probe said 
Best execution is an anti fraud measure in federal law that requires brokerages to  among other things  achieve the best price in the shortest possible time frame 
The SEC is not the only authority looking into this activity  In August 2013  E Trade disclosed in regulatory filings that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  FINRA   which self polices brokerages  was probing how it prices and routes orders to one of its affiliates 
It is unclear whether the SEC s requests for information will result in any enforcement actions 
The SEC may potentially find some violations surrounding the quality of the disclosures brokerages are required to make concerning best execution  one of the people familiar with the matter said 
For instance  brokerages may be promising to deliver best execution  but may then be routing some of the orders to anonymous trading venues known as  dark pools  where there is a risk that they may not be getting best execution  the person said 
SEC rules require brokerages to submit quarterly reports detailing their payment for order flow arrangements  as well as monthly reports on best execution 
In addition  brokerages are required to make accurate statements to investors about their policies in account statements and account opening documents 
ACADEMIC STUDY
The SEC s inquiry is seeking information from firms both through traditional subpoenas  and through so called 17a requests  which refer to a provision in federal securities laws that requires brokerages and other firms to maintain certain books and records  The requests were sent out earlier this year  one person said 
Researchers from the University of Notre Dame and the business school at Indiana University raised similar questions when they released in late 2013 a study suggesting that payment for order flow practices may be creating conflicts of interest that harm retail investors 
That study looked at four discount brokerages that accept payments for order flow   TD Ameritrade  E Trade  Scottrade and Fidelity Investments 
It found that the firms tend to route  limit orders  to the exchanges that pay the highest rebate fees  a potential conflict of interest that at times can lead to trades not getting executed at the best possible times  A limit order instructs the broker to buy or sell a stock at a specific price  or better 
Spokesmen for E TRADE Financial Corporation  NASDAQ ETFC   Scottrade and Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  declined to comment about the SEC s investigation or the study s findings  In response to the study  a spokesman for Fidelity said that best execution is its  highest priority  for its customers 
All of the firms routinely say they are complying with federal laws to get their customers the best execution 
Earlier this year  FINRA announced that it plans to make best execution issues a priority during 2014 exams of firms  and had launched new surveillance patterns to monitor for compliance 
 We are looking very closely at the firms  practices to ensure compliance with their best execution obligations with respect to limit orders in equity securities   FINRA spokesman George Smaragdis said 
The SEC several years ago brought high profile cases against some firms for best execution violations  In one 2008 case  the SEC said Scottrade misrepresented its policies for how it routed orders and also failed to conduct a rigorous review to ensure its customers were receiving best execution  In 2007  the SEC found that Morgan Stanley delayed executing some retail orders and embedded undisclosed mark ups and mark downs in others  Both firms settled the charges and paid fines 
CASH FEES
In the United States  market makers such as KCG Holdings  Inc   KCG   Citadel LLC  Citigroup Inc  NYSE C  and UBS AG  NYSE UBS  typically pay cash fees in the neighborhood of 30 cents per hundred shares for orders  Many U S  stock exchanges use a maker taker payment model that offers similarly priced rebates to brokers for providing liquidity  and charges fees if liquidity is taken away 
Some policymakers at the SEC have started to question whether it may be time to make some changes concerning how brokerages are compensated for order flow 
In a speech in April  SEC Democratic Commissioner Luis Aguilar called for launching a temporary program to test the effects of banning the maker taker model  saying he fears it may lead to conflicts that hurt best execution 
Schwab said last month it expects to earn about  100 million this year from selling client orders  E TRADE Financial Corporation  NASDAQ ETFC  collected about  25 million in the first quarter for sending orders to certain exchanges and traders  it said on a conference call in April ",2014-05-06,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/brokerages-face-sec-probe-on-retail-orders-282416,282416

152131,373647,ETFC,Credit Suisse exits U S  retail market making business,news,"By John McCrank NEW YORK  Reuters    Credit Suisse Group  VX CSGN  is getting out of the U S  equity retail market making business by the end of the first quarter after failing to gain enough scale to make a go of it  the bank confirmed on Tuesday   The decision was part of Credit Suisse s ongoing review of its investment banking business and does not affect the rest of its retail execution services operations  the Swiss bank said in a statement  Credit Suisse also runs Crossfinder  the largest non exchange U S  stock trading platform  or  dark pool    Credit Suisse is constantly assessing how to best create efficiencies for our franchise and our clients  We remain committed to continuing to provide our clients with a top tier offering   the bank said   Retail market makers facilitate trading by using their own capital to buy stock orders from retail brokerages while attempting to profit off of the spread between the bid and offer prices  often earning just pennies at a time  making scale important  Market makers usually pay to access retail orders because executing those orders tends to be more profitable than making markets for professional traders  But if the price of a stock moves in the wrong direction before the market maker can offload it  the profits evaporate   Regulators have been probing whether retail brokers have been sending their clients  orders to the market makers willing to pay them the most money  rather than those that will give the best price to the end client   A Credit Suisse spokeswoman said the scrutiny around payment for order flow had nothing to do with the bank s decision to exit market making   Credit Suisse entered retail market making in 2011  but never managed to break into the ranks of the top market makers  which include KCG Holdings  N KCG   Citadel  UBS Group AG  N UBS   Citigroup  N C   Susquehanna  and Two Sigma Securities   There were only five employees in Credit Suisse s retail market making division  and they will be moved to a new agency led unit that will act as a middleman for clients  taking their orders and shipping them off to firms that do make markets   
While big retail brokerages like TD Ameritrade  N AMTD   Charles Schwab Corp  N SCHW   and E Trade  O ETFC  did not use Credit Suisse s market making services in the fourth quarter of 2014  several smaller firms did send the bank a significant portion of their retail orders  according to regulatory filings ",2015-02-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/credit-suisse-exits-u.s.-retail-market-making-business-326381,326381
152132,373648,ETFC,SEC s stock market reform club locks out retail brokers,news,"By John McCrank NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission is convening a group of financial industry veterans for the first time next month to consider stock market reforms  but one group will be conspicuously absent  retail brokerages  The SEC s 17 member Market Structure Advisory Committee includes representatives of fund companies  an exchange  off exchange trading venues  dealers  and academia  among others  The group  which meets four times a year  will review old rules  and advise the SEC on a range of new regulations designed to make sure the market is as stable and fair as possible  Still  given that the SEC has said its main priority is to protect retail investors  the omission of retail brokers raises questions  because without their point of view the panel may recommend changes that favor institutional investors  analysts said  Retail investors place around 16 percent of all U S  stock orders    There s a missing gap of protecting retail order flow   said Larry Tabb  chief executive of capital markets advisory firm TABB Group   That gap was also noticed by committee member Joseph Ratterman  president and chairman of No  2 U S  exchange operator BATS Global Markets  He said he mentioned his concern to SEC Chair Mary Jo White shortly after the committee was announced and that she asked him  along with committee member Jamil Nazarali  from market making firm Citadel Securities  to formally represent retail interests   Citadel and BATS do not directly interact with retail investors  and their interests sometimes diverge from retail brokers     The SEC declined to comment  and hasn t said how it chose the committee members   The major retail brokerages  including  Charles Schwab  Corp  N SCHW   TD Ameritrade  N AMTD   E Trade  O ETFC   Fidelity and Scottrade  also declined to comment on the record  Once the regulator made the names of the panel public  some retail brokerages began lobbying for a seat at the table  but were told that the process would not be restarted  according to people familiar with the matter who did not have permission to speak publicly     We were kind of shocked   said a senior executive at one retail brokerage   I mean  if you re going to talk about market structure and how it impacts investors  you might want to have someone who deals with retail investors   The SEC told the retail brokers that they will have opportunities to post public comment letters on the issues discussed by the committee and that the firms would also be included in separate roundtable discussions on market structure issues  the executive said   In the meantime  the firms will use the retail advisory committee formed by BATS and Citadel will serve as their proxy   If you re not going to be part of the club  you ve got to have somebody that at least is going to express your point of view at the club meetings   the executive said  FILLING IN THE GAP  Ratterman and Nazarali said they plan to meet with senior executives from Schwab  TD Ameritrade  E Trade  Fidelity and Scottrade before and after each of the committee s meetings to solicit their views  which they will pass on to the broader group   It s one of many voices  but it s always going to be a significant voice   Ratterman said of the retail point of view  In addition  Citadel is having discussions with its other clients to ensure the firm can properly represent the industry on market structure issues  Nazarali said   We believe it is important to create a level playing field for all investors   he said   This retail advisory committee enables us to continue advocating on behalf of firms of all sizes   One recent example of a proposed SEC rule that retail brokers say will harm investors is the so called  tick size pilot  which would apply to shares of a large set of smaller companies  Once in effect  brokers will have to sell each share of these companies at prices at least a nickel higher than where they buy them  instead of the penny difference currently required  That wider gap gives brokers higher profits  which in theory will make it more worth their while to take the other sides of trades for investors  making it easier to complete transactions in these thinly traded stocks  But those benefits might mean more to big investors  who might look to sell large numbers of shares at once  than to small investors  Individual investors typically make smaller trades  and being forced to buy at prices that are a nickel a share higher than where they can sell could amount to their paying a sort of tax to the broker   Schwab said in a letter to the SEC that the program would ultimately result in a  wealth transfer  from retail investors to stock exchanges and middlemen  Fidelity also said in a letter to the regulator that it does not support the plan  
The potential cost of the program to all investors could be up to  455 million dollars annually  TD Ameritrade said in a letter to the SEC in December  The No  1 retail broker by client trading volume estimated the potential cost to its customers between  11 million and  18 4 million ",2015-04-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sec's-stock-market-reform-club-locks-out-retail-brokers-338950,338950

152203,373719,ETFC,Is E TRADE Financial  ETFC  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put E TRADE Financial Corporation   NASDAQ ETFC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  E Trade Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 38  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 88  If we focus on the long term PE trend  E Trade Financial s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 20 80 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 12  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that E Trade Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 70  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for E Trade Financial stock in the near term too P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management  and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  E Trade Financial s P CF ratio of 8 69 is higher than the Zacks Financial Investment Bank industry average of 32 65  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  E Trade Financial currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes E Trade Financial a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for E Trade Financial is just 0 98  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 19  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  ETFC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though E Trade Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of A  This gives ETFC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been robust at best  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen six up and none down in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 4 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below E TRADE Financial Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat sturdy trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineE Trade Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 33  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Financial   Investment Bank industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2019-06-11,Zacks Investment

152223,373739,ETFC,3 China Tech Stocks Poised To Outperform As Potential Trade Deal Nears,opinion,"Optimism has increased that Washington could soon reach a deal with Beijing to end their protracted trade dispute  which has helped fuel this year s 16  rally in the S P 500 to near all time highs  Indeed  the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF  NYSE KWEB  has gained 29  so far this year  significantly outperforming the broader market 

As such  we re eyeing three China tech related stocks  each poised to outperform in the weeks ahead amid renewed optimism for a resolution to the U S  China trade war  One is a proven global market leader in its field  the second operates an online website for automobile consumers  and the third is a recent fintech IPO  which has been on a tear since its trading debut last month 
1  Alibaba Group Holdings
Perhaps no Chinese e commerce company is more well known than Alibaba  NYSE BABA   It dominates the market in China with a 58  share of online retail sales  Its e commerce platform is underpinned by two marketplaces  Taobao  which is similar to eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   and Tmall  which is more of a curated site  hosting brands like Nike and Zara 
With those leading platforms  Alibaba enjoys significant competitive advantages  as retailers both foreign and domestic look to the company to reach China s online shoppers  We highlighted the stock last month and consider one of the best Chinese plays over the long term  As well  it was among Investing com s top stocks to watch in 2019  At the time  we said 

 Jack Ma s cash cow went from a high of  210 in June to  150 in early November  Should the trade war subside  investors might see a return to possibly even the  200  mark  

Indeed  shares  which closed at  185 78 yesterday  are up 35 5  since the start of the year  It reached a nine month high of  189 79 on April 12 

We continue to expect significant upside from here and recommend accumulating shares as the company is well positioned as a leader in its field 
Alibaba next reports earnings on May 6 before the open  Consensus calls for EPS of  6 65 on revenue of  91 84 billion for the first quarter  The company announced earnings of  5 73 per share in the same period a year earlier on revenue of  61 93 billion 
2  Autohome Inc 
The leading online destination for car buyers in China  Autohome  NYSE ATHM  provides automobile listing services  advertising services and dealer subscription services  among other things  Its ability to reach a large and engaged user base of automobile consumers has made Autohome the preferred platform for car manufacturers and dealers wanting to conduct advertising campaigns and publicize their services 
The company operates its  Autohome Mall   a full service online transaction platform  to facilitate transactions for manufacturers and dealers  Further  through its website and mobile applications  Autohome also provides value added  car specific services including financing  insurance  used car transactions and aftermarket assistance 

Shares of Autohome  which closed at  108 34 yesterday  have gained 38 5  so far this year  Despite the strong start to 2019  the stock remains below its all time high of  119 50  hit last June

Up Fintech  NASDAQ TIGR   which went public on March 20  is an online brokerage firm focusing on Chinese investors around the world  The company was launched to enable Chinese clients to easily trade overseas stocks on foreign exchanges  especially in the U S   according to CEO Tianhua Wu 

Shares of UP Fintech  known in Asia as Tiger Brokers  closed yesterday at  22  up 175  from the  8 a share at its IPO debut  The offering raised about  104 million for the company 
Lei Huang  CEO of UP Fintech s American unit  said proceeds from the IPO will be used for general corporate purposes  global expansion  net capital requirements and to fund potential acquisitions 
Strategic investors in UP Fintech include Beijing based smartphone giant Xiaomi  HK 1810  and U S  online brokerage Interactive Brokers Group  NYSE IBKR   Wu said UP Fintech s goal is to become similar to E TRADE Financial  NASDAQ ETFC   a U S  brokerage firm that rose to prominence in the internet startup boom of the late 1990s 
While UP Fintech is not yet profitable  it has had very strong sales growth  The company reported a net loss of  44 3 million in 2018  but revenue rose to  33 6 million from  5 5 million the year previous ",2019-04-17,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-china-tech-stocks-poised-to-outperform-as-hopes-of-trade-deal-nears-200407497,200407497

the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Telefonica  MC TEF  Brasil S A    NYSE VIV    E Trade   NASDAQ ETFC   and Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  All Eyes on the Fed  Global Week AheadAll eyes will be glued onto the Fed during this Global Week Ahead On Wednesday  the FOMC likely hikes 25 basis points  after its two day meeting Below is a summary of core expectations and risks  gratis Scotia Bank Fed funds target range  All dealers and banks including Scotia expect a 25 bps hike in the fed funds target range  which would take the upper bound to 2 50   Markets are still not fully priced for a hike  leaving open the chance of a dovish surprise  Further gradual increases    The minutes noted the statement reference to  further gradual increases  might need to be revised in a way  that placed greater emphasis on the evaluation of incoming data in assessing the economic and policy outlook  Fed funds projection  Prior 2018 19 projections for the mid point of the target range to end at 2 375  and 3 125   respectively  will remain unchanged Growth and inflation forecasts  Relative to the projections that were last updated in September  there may be a focus upon revising PCE inflation expectations lower over 2019 and perhaps further out  Oil market developments since the last projections could be used to inform such a forecast bias Neutral rate  Don t expect any changes  The minutes to the November meeting indicated that only  a couple of participants  believed that the policy rate  might currently be near its neutral level and that further increases in the federal funds rate could unduly slow the expansion   The Fed s neutral rate estimate of 3  probably remains reasonable at this point Language  The statement could soften reference to  strong  job gains and the unemployment rate  has declined  Balance sheet  This is the meeting at which the long awaited balance sheet discussion is likely to occur What follows  These are the five big Reuters in London global market themes These themes will likely dominate the thinking of both investors and traders in the Global Week Ahead  Not surprisingly  the list leads with the Fed The Reuters list also includes a Bank of England meeting  with its Brexit worries  and a Bank of Japan meeting  with its negative rate still on   Their list ends with a discussion of the end of  QE  by Mario Draghi of the ECB In short  this week is all about monetary policy  wherever you look  1  The FOMC Meets and HikesThe Federal Reserve is almost certain to hike U S  interest rates for the fourth time this year to 2 25 2 50 percent on Wednesday  but it will be What they say  not what they do  that really matters Money markets have swung dramatically in recent months and are now only fully pricing one more hike in 2019  having expected another two or three  at least  earlier in the year The reason for the shift is that the U S  China trade war and the Fed s tightening are already taking a toll on growth and on the stock market  With large parts of the U S  equity market already in bear market territory  investors will hope for comforting words from the Fed  Slower   or no   rate rises in 2019 would be the perfect early Christmas present  2  The BoE  U K  Pound and BrexitWith sterling set for its biggest weekly drop in seven weeks after a tumultuous week in British politics  markets are slowly digesting the possibility that the UK could crash out of the European Union at the end of March without a deal Though the majority of analysts think that an iteration of Prime Minister Theresa May s current deal will ultimately be passed by parliament  some investors say signs of stress are emerging in British assets  similar to what was seen during the dark depths of the Eurozone crisis For example  90 day correlations between the benchmark UK stock index and the British pound has strengthened in recent days   normally both these assets move inversely to each other The cost of insuring against a UK debt default is at the highest since the 2016 vote and some big banks say a lurch into a  hard  Brexit where ties are badly severed would hack another 5 10 percent of sterling  3  Don t Forget About the Bank of Japan  BOJ  It is rare for the Bank of Japan to rock the boat at its policy meetings  but the ship Haruhiko Kuroda is steering is so large that even miniscule maneuvers can cause massive waves  After all  the BOJ s balance sheet has just surpassed the size of the economy  raising questions of how this can ever be unwound Speculation of the BOJ s dissatisfaction with elements of its ultra loose monetary policy  especially the impact on smaller banks  has raised some expectation that bond markets could be allowed to trade in a slightly wider range  The BOJ also owns almost 80 percent of Japan s ETFs  which critics say distorts the stock market Alas  though  any intention to tweak policy towards the tighter side will have been foiled by the economy s latest developments  Japan is clearly de syncing with the rest of the world economy   its economy just shrank the most in four years and export orders are seen contracting at the fastest pace in two years  a consequence of the trade war embroiling its mighty neighbor next door and a peaking electronics supercycle  And inflation is nowhere near target Expect Captain Kuroda to maintain a steady course ahead  4  Emerging Market Stocks  Down Hard in 2018  Where from Here MSCI s emerging currency index is down 25 percent from its January highs but signs of a very modest rebound in recent weeks have provided some hope for next year Of course  huge dollar borrowings in EM means the fate of many is still in the hands the Fed and the greenback  but local central bankers do have some sway and there are a multitude of rate meetings coming up Following another hike from arch hawk Russia on Friday markets reckon more hikes are possible in Indonesia  which has upped rates six times already in 2018  the Czech Republic where policy has tightened four times in a row and in Mexico  which raised rates in November for the third time to a decade high Thailand may deliver a rise for the first time in seven years  and there are also rate setting meetings in Colombia and Taiwan to watch  too  But here s the rub   expectation is building that the U S  Fed will pause after one more hike next year  If it does  emerging markets  might find 2019 more relaxing than feared  5  It s a Post  QE  World After the ECB MeetingIn less than two weeks the ECB s 2 6 trillion euro stimulus extraordinaire draws to a close  but Eurozone share prices  especially for banks  are lower today than in 2015 when the printing presses were switched on  But hope dies last Many reckon the very fact that Mario Draghi feels confident enough to end QE is a good sign  Draghi did downgrade growth and inflation forecasts  but banks and their investors are clinging to hope that prices might move up enough to justify a rate hike towards end 2019 They could argue that even after QE ends the ECB will remain in the market to reinvest the proceeds of maturing bonds  What s more  lenders would benefit if it meets expectations of a new round of so called LTROs  cheap long term loans to banks Another positive is the apparent ceasefire between Italy and Brussels over the former s 2019 budget  Potentially that allows Italian banks to get on with the business of cleaning up their balance sheets  consequently  the Milan banking index was flat this week Finally  there is nothing like M A activity to get shareholders excited

152373,373889,ETFC,How To Screen For Stocks On Sale,opinion,"    Tracey s Private Room On Stock Twits 1     Volatile Market and Major Pull Backs 8     Oversold Value Stock Screener 12     Tracey s Top Stock Picks  AMTD  ETFC  ABG  SAVE  RH 20     Takeaways On The Oversold StocksWelcome to Episode  120 of the Value Investor Podcast
Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
The major stock indexes had another big single day drop on Dec 4 with the Dow Industrials falling over 3  
But if you thought that was the largest drop of the year  you d be wrong 
That was the fourth single session where the Dow lost more than 3  in 2018  The other three days were Oct 10  when it was down 3 1   Feb 5  when it lost 4 6  and Feb 8 when it was down 4 2  
Yet  most investors probably don t remember the other three days when there was a lot of pain in the portfolio 
Over the longer term  the volatility tends to get smoothed out 
However  with these big single day plunges  some stocks do go on sale  But how do investors find them 
Screening for Stocks on Sale
Sometimes you have to run several screens before finding what you re looking for 
Tracey first ran a Zacks Predefined screen from Zacks com on oversold stocks  It was geared more towards the  oversold  part and didn t give her the focus on fundamentals 
It returned 34 stocks 
Bed Bath   Beyond   NASDAQ BBBY   and Snap Inc   NYSE SNAP   were both results of that screen  Bed  Bath   Beyond is down 32  over the last past 3 months while Snap has plunged 41  
But Snap still doesn t have a P E and Bed Bath   Beyond has been a value trap in 2018 
Starting over  Tracey screened for value stocks expecting to see some that had sold off but she would then also get the value fundamentals she sought 
This screen  which included forward and trailing P Es  the Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy    a Zacks Style Score for Value of A or B  the two top categories  and a Zacks Industry Rank in the top 50  
It returned 36 stocks 
Here are three of the results 
Are These Value Stocks on Sale 
1        E TRADE Financial   NASDAQ ETFC   is down 18  over the last past 3 months so it s gone on  sale  at least in terms of its share price  In that same time period  the S P 500 declined 6 8  
2        RH   NYSE RH   is down 9 4  over the prior 3 months so it is on sale compared to the S P 500 but not by a lot  It also sports a forward P E of 16 looking at 2019 projected earnings  That s cheaper than the stock has been in the past  Is it on  sale  
3        Spirit Airlines   NYSE SAVE   is one of the few stocks in the screen that still has a value P E of 15 but the shares are going the other direction  up  Shares have jumped 31  over the past 3 months as crude has plunged 
Is this the worst of the recent stock weakness or is more to come 
Should you hold out for an even bigger sale in stocks

152375,373891,ETFC,Wells Fargo s  WFC  Reform Proposals Get Rejected By Fed ,opinion,"In a major setback for Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC    the central bank has rejected its scandal prevention plans and demanded a stricter check over management  The news was reported by Reuters 
Wells Fargo had put forth the plan in April 2018  following which  CEO Tim Sloan and other executives had been in discussions with Fed officials over the ideal measures 
Per people with knowledge of the matter  Wells Fargo was supposed to have the plan  approved  implemented and an independent third party review completed  by the end of September 2018  However  the bank has clearly missed the target date  which could have led to more penalties  but the regulator has instead decided to allot Wells Fargo more time to satisfy the settlement terms 
Delay in plan approval is likely to keep Wells Fargo s asset growth restricted for a longer period  In order to get the cap lifted earlier  the bank will have to bolster its governance and controls 
Recently  the Sans Francisco based bank sacked three dozen district managers on charges of failing to conduct proper oversight  which contributed to the major sales scandal  It was an attempt by Wells Fargo to convince regulators of the progress it s making in bolstering the internal control systems 
However  the Fed might be requiring Wells Fargo to take some actions to monitor the senior management level 
Since the breakout of the bogus account openings scandal in late 2016  Wells Fargo has been getting involved in a number of probes  which are likely to keep its cost base elevated  However  the bank has diligently taken remedial measures and initiatives to keep afloat  Also  its cost control plans might help it deal with the pressure on costs 
Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 8 2  over the past six months compared with 8 6  decline recorded by the  it belongs to 

Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

152376,373892,ETFC,Evercore On Track To Grow Investment Banking  Costs Rise,opinion,"On Dec 10  we issued an updated research report on Evercore   NYSE EVR    The company s major revenue contributing segment   Investment Banking   continues to support its top line  Notably  it remains focused on undertaking efforts to increase client base in advisory solutions along with geographical expansion efforts  in order to further drive revenue growth   
Evercore remains committed to enhancing shareholders  value  It is seen from its involvement in steady capital deployment activities  which seem sustainable as the company s debt equity ratio compares favorably with the broader industry  The company has been raising dividends every year since 2010  with the latest hike of 25  announced in April 2018  Also  a share repurchase program is in place 
Further  Evercore seems undervalued when compared with the broader industry as its current price to earnings and price to cash flow ratios are below the respective industry averages  Further  the stock has a  of A 
However  falling institutional assets under management trend  on account of foreign exchange fluctuations  has resulted in reduced fees  Also  no major contribution is expected from this segment to the company s revenues in the near term 
Also  Evercore s expense base has seen a CAGR of 19  over the last five years  ended 2017   In order to build its segments  the company has been on a hiring spree  which has resulted in increased compensation costs  Thus  continual expense rise exposes the company to operational risks  which is likely to impact bottom line growth 
On account of these concerns  the stock has lost 15 5  in a year s time compared with 23 1  decline of the  it belongs to 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings has remained stable at  7 15 over the past 30 days  As a result  it currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

first quarter of 2018 and reported record revenues with sales of  2 4B  up 15  from the same quarter in 2017 Brokers also typically benefit from higher interest rates as it increases the amount they collect on margin balances and Schwab saw net interest margins increase to 2 2  from 1 87 a year earlier Despite higher costs for employee compensation and a one time charge due to a  15M loss in

152532,374048,ETFC,E Trade Financial  QAD  Amazon  General Motors And Facebook As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate Release         Chicago  IL   April 25  2018    highlights E Trade Financial   NASDAQ ETFC   as the Bull of the Day and QAD Inc    NASDAQ QADA   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    General Motors   NYSE GM   and Facebook   NASDAQ FB   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks                                                 After years of steady gains and low volatility  the stock market finally hit some turbulence in early February 2018 on the back of interest rate uncertainty and political question marks  and those woes continued in the months to come thanks to trade woes and rising Treasury yields  This has caused market wide uncertainty at times  but investors should note that increased buying and selling actually benefits brokers  many of which are publicly traded One such company is E Trade Financial  a leader in the online brokerage industry since the 1990s  As seen in the company s recent earnings report  increased trading activity created a blowout quarter for E Trade  and now the stock is sticking out as one of the strongest in the entire financial services sector Now  after strong results and positive forward looking comments inspired several positive analyst estimate revisions  ETFC is sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Latest Earnings ReportLast week  E Trade posted earnings of  0 80 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 79 and improving significantly from the  0 48 per share recorded in the prior year quarter  Total revenue for the quarter came in at  708 million  outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  690 million  Revenues were up 28  from the year ago quarter The key contributor to this success was the company s daily average revenue trades  DARTs  results  Total DARTs increased 26  year over year to 309 000  including 32  growth in derivatives  At the end of the quarter  E Trade had 5 5 million customer accounts  up 4  from the year ago quarter E Trade s positive report ushered in a plethora of positive estimate revisions for the remainder of the company s fiscal year  In less than a week since its report  we have seen five revisions to its 2018 EPS estimates  with 100  agreement to the upside among revising analysts  That same ratio is also present in terms of fiscal 2019 revisions The Zacks Consensus Estimate for E Trade s fiscal 2018 earnings has gained 17 cents in a week  Our consensus projection for its fiscal 2019 earnings has gained 15 cents in that time ValuationFor many investors  improving analyst sentiment is just part of the picture  and it is still important to make sure we are not overpaying for this revision activity  Luckily  E Trade is not outside the range a value investor would look for In fact  the stock is trading at a respectable 16 5x forward 12 month earnings  That is a premium to its industry s average of 11 5x  but it is certainly not outrageous  The stock is actually trading at a discount to its industry when we factor in earnings growth  Investors are rightfully willing to pay premiums for stocks with explosive earnings growth  but in uncertainty market conditions  it is best to avoid growth stocks with sluggish analyst revision activity and inflated valuations  One such company is QAD Inc QAD Inc  is a global provider of enterprise software applications  The company s core product  QAD Enterprise Applications  is an integrated suite of software applications deployable in computer infrastructures  on demand and on premise deployment as well underlying databases  hardware platforms and operating systems QAD promises dramatic improvements to its bottom line this fiscal year  but analysts have begun to sour on its prospects  and negative revision activity has earned the stock a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Estimate Revision ActivityOver the past 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimates for QAD s current fiscal year and next year have slumped considerably  thanks at least in part to negative estimate revisions  These consensus projections are now 10 cents and 13 cents lower  respectively  than they were just two months ago The Zacks Rank is a proven model that places a significant emphasis on estimates and estimate revisions  and we have found that negative revision activity often foreshadows volatility for a stock  But the concerns do not stop there for QADA Stretched ValuationEven with its lowered expectations  QAD is projected to report EPS growth of a staggering 536 4  in the current fiscal year  That type of earnings improvement typically allows for stretched valuations  with growth investors piling in on the back of bottom line expansion more so than anything else However  growth investors will be cognizant of the company s volatile earnings outlook  leading us to once again question the QADA s stretched valuation Shares of the enterprise software stock are currently trading at more than 94x forward 12 month earnings  This is more than triple the industry average of about 31x  Meanwhile  the stock also has a P S ratio of 2 9  so investors are not getting an awfully good deal for the company s revenue picture either The company also does not have a great cash situation right now  Cash flow is sitting at   0 17 per share  with cash flow growth coming in at  143 5   This should cause us to question whether the company can sustain any positive momentum that might be caused by earnings growth in the long term Finally  investors should note that shares have already surged more than 50  over the past year  implying that its EPS improvement is probably priced in  This does not look like a stock that will challenge its 52 week high soon Why Did Amazon  AMZN  Sink Tuesday Shares of Amazon fell on Tuesday  just a couple of days before the e commerce powerhouse is expected to report its first quarter financial results  Let s take a look to see what might have caused Amazon s stock to slip as Q1 earnings season heats up Amazon announced last week that its Prime program currently boasts 100 million paying members worldwide  This was the first time that Jeff Bezos  company publicly revealed how many people pay for its highly visible Prime memberships  Since then  Amazon investors have had a lot of other information to digest as they assess what to do with Amazon stock ahead of the release of its first quarter earnings results  after market close on Thursday  April 26 ProtestsAn estimated 450 members of a German trade union took to the streets to protest Bezos and Amazon before the CEO was presented an award on Tuesday  The organization has reportedly led numerous strikes at Amazon in Germany over the last few years  calling for the company to raise pay for warehouse workers    Some protestors held signs that read     and even a few German government officials spoke out against Amazon s tax practices  Amazon has rejected the union s demands multiple times  But Amazon investors should note that Germany is the company s second biggest market behind the U S With that said  if the current pay issues continue  while Amazon faces more tax related backlash  investors might want Amazon to take some action in Germany Car DeliveryAmazon just announced that it partnered with Volvo Cars and General Motors to allow the company to deliver packages to customers  vehicles  The move marks a continued push from Amazon to become more intimate with its customers as it looks to gain access to their homes  and now cars Some investors might welcome Amazon s latest delivery offering  while others will likely become more concerned about how much they are willing to let a company enter their lives  Either way  it underlines a wave of package thefts that have occurred as Amazon items pile up on porches and lobbies Q1 Estimates Amazon posted a strong fourth quarter  with revenue and adjusted earnings both topping our Zacks Consensus Estimates  Looking ahead  the company is expected to see its Q1 revenues soar by 40 4  to reach  50 16 billion  Meanwhile  Amazon s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to sink by 17 6  to hit  1 22 per share Some investors might not be concerned with Amazon s quarterly earnings  considering that the company is still in its growth stage and seems to care very little about its bottom line as it expands into new industries With that said  analysts at Piper Jaffray noted recently that Amazon might have to blow investors away for the company s stock price to continue to climb   A lot of things are going to have to really come through well for Amazon to keep the stock moving higher here   analyst Craig Johnson said in an interview with CNBC on Monday Johnson also noted that a lot of positive news is already priced into Amazon stock  which is up nearly 30  since the start of the year Amazon is scheduled to report Q1 results on Thursday  one day after fellow tech power Facebook Follow us on Twitter   Join us on Facebook   Zacks Investment Research is under common

152556,374072,ETFC,Goldman Sachs  Ratings Affirmed By Moody s  Outlook Stable,opinion,"Ratings of The Goldman Sachs Group   NYSE GS   and its subsidiaries have been affirmed by the Moody s Investors Service  The outlook for the parent holding company has remained stable  Also  the company s senior debt rating has been affirmed at A3 
However  outlook on the operating subsidiaries has been lowered from stable to negative  Ratings of deposits at Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs International Bank has been affirmed at A1 while senior debt of Goldman Sachs International has been rated A1  The rating agency had also upgraded the baseline credit assessment of Goldman Sachs International Bank to baa2 from baa3 
Reasoning Behind the Ratings
The ratings affirmation is indicative of Goldman Sachs consistent quarterly performance despite pressure on revenues and wise decision making measures  Capital ratios declined further in late 2017 due to the impact of tax reform as a result of which the company would be repurchasing lesser shares in the first six months of 2018 than what was authorized as part of its 2017 Capital Plan  Per Moody s  this is likely to benefit the capital ratios 
On the other hand  negative outlook on the subsidiaries is reflective of the revenue challenges it faces in its Institutional Client Services segment  contributed 37  of revenues in 2017  due to low volatility in capital markets  Though efforts to control expenses  increasing revenues in other segments along with growth in loans balance had offset the negatives to some extent  Moody s feels that Goldman Sachs  loan growth strategy would have an impact on the stability of its earnings 
Further  Moody s downgraded the outlook due to a decline in Goldman Sachs  share of revenues in the sales and trading business among its peers  owing to a lesser diversified client base  However  the rating agency feels the decline is temporary  It expects that increase in volatility will boost trading volumes among its active investor clients and Goldman Sachs  initiatives to build client base 
The outlook for the parent holding company has been left unchanged on the back of a potential benefit to its senior creditors of a lower severity of loss in the event of breakdown due to the significant increase in the company s debt outstanding over the last two years  The larger amount of debt would provide greater loss absorption capacity at such times 
Per Moody s advanced loss given failure analysis  this will benefit the holding company s senior creditors and could provide an additional uplift if it is sustained  going forward  While the increased loss absorption capacity would also benefit creditors of the operating subsidiaries  these ratings already receive the maximum uplift of three notches from the baseline credit assessment allowed under Moody s Banks rating methodology 
What Could Make Moody s Change the Ratings 
Ratings of Goldman Sachs  operating subsidiaries are not likely to be ungraded in absence of a significant reduction in the firm s dependence on earnings from its capital markets business  However  the rating outlook on the operating subsidiaries could return to stable from negative if loan growth slows and it recovers its lost market share in sales and trading without significantly increasing market risk  If  at the same time  the level of the holding company s debt is sustained at current levels as a proportion of tangible banking assets  then its senior debt could be upgraded one notch 
On the flip side  Goldman Sachs  ratings could be downgraded if it is unable to recover the temporary loss of market share in its sales and trading businesses or continues to grow its loans aggressively at the same rate as it did in 2017  Also  if the firm fails to strengthen its capital ratios above the level reported at 2017 end  or if there are any indications of control or risk management failures  a marked increase in risk appetite  any deterioration in its liquidity profile  or a decline in profitability  ratings can be lowered 
The company s shares have rallied 20  in the past six months  underperforming 28 9  gain of the

152616,374132,ETFC,E TRADE  ETFC  Might Witness Ratings Upgrades By Moody s,opinion,"E TRADE Financial Corporation   NASDAQ ETFC   and E TRADE Bank s ratings are under review for upgrade by Moody s Investors Service  In July 2016  following the acquisition of OptionsHouse  Moody s had affirmed the company s rating as stable 
Per Moody s  E TRADE is well poised to benefit from the increasing interest rates  Higher rates supported the company s revenues when a pricing cut in early 2017 led to lower commission income  Also  the company s effort to expand its balance sheet is encouraging   Further  E TRADE s strong credit position displays its hold on strategies for overall growth 
Moody s is of the opinion that E TRADE s effort toward conservative use of leverage in acquisitions and shareholder distribution policies is a key positive  Also  it expects E TRADE to maintain this approach while undertaking inorganic growth strategies in the future 
While reviewing E TRADE s ratings for upgrade  Moody s is expected to analyze the key headwinds to credit profile along with the competitive scenario in commissions and deposit pricing  Also  the company s revenue growth prospects along with financial metrics for inorganic growth and capital deployment activities will be considered  Lastly  E TRADE Bank s funding profile and stability of its cash sweep deposits will be reviewed 
What Can Drive the Ratings Up
E TRADE s ratings might get upgraded if Moody s feels that the impact of future competitive pressures on commission and deposit pricing will not have a significant impact on its performance and that the company is successful in expanding its profits without hurting its credit profile 
What Can Drive the Ratings Down
The ratings will be affected if the company undertakes a debt funded approach for inorganic growth strategies  especially if debt EBITDA rises to about 2 5x  with no concrete plan to return to low debt leverage position 
Also  a significant deterioration in franchise value through a security breach of client accounts  a significant legal or compliance issue resulting in reputational damage  loss of customers and litigation costs pressuring profit margins  might lead to a fall in ratings 
Shares of E TRADE have gained 43 5  over the past year  outperforming the  s growth of 19 1  

Currently  the stock sports a Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buy   You can see  
Some other stocks worth considering in the same space are Interactive Brokers Group   NASDAQ IBKR    TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation   NASDAQ AMTD   and Evercore   NYSE EVR    All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank of 1

152707,374223,ETFC,Ride The Momentum Wave With These 4 Picks,opinion,In basketball  when a player hits a few shots in a row  he is said to have a  hot hand   In finance  we call it  momentum  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift At the core  momentum investing works on the principle of  Buy High  Sell Higher  Thus  this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast moving train  without fretting about valuations or growth prospects  But why does momentum strategy work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason for momentum strategy to work  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will spring back to their original prices  On the other hand  many investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things gain clarity  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends  and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Also  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining remarkably robust and persistent ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s  This is especially important as academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  becomes known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes Obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play  Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  and we have devised a strategy that will help investors get in on these trades and make handsome gains Our screen will help you take advantage of both long term price momentum and a

152843,374359,ETFC,E TRADE Financial Poised For Growth  Peer Pressure Lingers,opinion,"On Nov 28  2016  we issued an updated research report on E TRADE Financial Corporation   NASDAQ ETFC    We believe that the company s renewed focus on strengthening its trading business will boost its growth Management targets to achieve 2 3  incremental growth over a period of 18 24 months across assets  accounts  and trades  Further  the company s numerous restructuring measures and efforts to streamline balance sheet risk remains encouraging  However  fierce competition with big players  heightened regulatory norms and restrictions on the use of credit facility pose near term threat for the company s profitability and operational flexibility The company adopted restructuring move of eliminating entire wholesale funding obligations  This resulted in improving the company s balance sheet composition  along with removal of high cost funding and making space for onboard low cost deposits  These restructuring actions are expected to eliminate nearly  21 million of future annual expenses  mainly compensation and benefits 
Further  in order to streamline balance sheet risk  the company resorted to reducing credit risk in its legacy loan portfolios  We expect that such balance sheet restructuring will significantly improve the company s financials going forward In 2014  the company revamped the E TRADE brand  It is now focused on reinforcing its leadership position in trading business  E TRADE is working on enhancing its digital platform through improved capabilities on professional trading and mobile platforms  and introduction of new brokerage products and services  to better serve its customers

However  during third quarter 2016  the company did not make any share repurchase owing to the OptionsHouse acquisition  Nonetheless  in absence of any attractive business opportunity  management anticipates to resume share buybacks in second quarter 2017 E TRADE s improving credit trends also remain encouraging for its future growth prospects  The company recorded a benefit to provision for loan losses during the first nine months of 2016  compared to provision for loan losses in the prior year  With provisions likely to trend at normalized levels driven by management s efforts to optimize balance sheet  the company s bottom line growth remains positive However  E TRADE is exposed to intense competition from several established and renowned players that have greater financial  technical and marketing capabilities  These peers can offer better terms of service and conduct promotional activities to attract customers  Also  they are relatively better positioned to withstand the changing market conditions and adapt rapidly to take advantage of the available opportunities  These competitive factors can have an adverse impact on E TRADE s revenue and customer base Moreover  E TRADE  like many other financial services companies  is subject to stringent regulations  The Federal Reserve has drafted a series of new rules for the major U S  financial institutions  in order to stabilize the financial system  Such on going rule making processes are likely to affect the company s financial and business operations over the long term E TRADE s shares gained around 14  so far this year on the NasdaqGS  However  the stock has underperformed 16  gain of the Zacks categorized Investment Brokers industry E TRADE FINL CP Price

152920,374436,ETFC,Why Investment Broker Stocks Might Be A Good Bet Now,opinion,"Speculation over the timing of rate hike continues to influence market sentiments with the nearing of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting  While the final move by the Fed at its two day policy meeting  Sep 20 21  remains a key area to watch  recent speeches by several Fed officials reflect a divided stance On Monday  at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs  Fed Governor Lael Brainard s comments reflected a cautionary note  She stated   My main point here is that in the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures  it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the possibility of making further gains in the labor market   Throwing light on the global concerns  she further added   Headwinds from abroad should matter to U S  policymakers because recent experience suggests global financial markets are tightly integrated  such that disturbances emanating from Chinese or euro area financial markets quickly spill over to U S  financial markets  Among other officials  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari feels that there is no immediate need of a rate hike  while Governor Daniel Tarullo seeks more evidence of rise in inflation before considering a hike However  on Friday  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren had hawkish tone  He said   My personal view  based on data that we have received to date  is that a reasonable case can be made for continuing to pursue a gradual normalization of monetary policy   He added   if we want to ensure that we remain at full employment  gradual tightening is likely to be appropriate   Other officials whose recent comments reflected a support for rate hike include Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Federal Reserve Bank President of Richmond Jeffrey Lacker While mixed opinions are currently ruling the market  we believe several issues including the Brexit induced uncertainties  U S  dollar appreciation and the upcoming Presidential election might cause further delay in rate hike  Nevertheless  the continued positive domestic economic factors such as a recovery in job market and increased household spending certainly increase the odds of a hike by the end of this year As a rising rate environment boosts the performance of certain industries and hurts others  it is now time for the investors to re adjust their investment portfolios  The investment brokerage space typically benefits from a rising rate environment  so it could be a good industry to explore for picking stocks now Why Eye Brokerage Space Currently  out of more than 260 industries on our radar  the Investment Brokerage space has a  of 76  Top 30    Amid the unpredictable market conditions  it is important to consider the performance of an industry  This is because  more often than not  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that can boost securities across the board  In fact  studies have shown that an average stock in a strong industry is likely to outperform a great stock in a poor industry With a rise in rates  brokerages firms are likely to engage in more investment activities  Investment brokers earn interest income on un invested cash in client accounts  Therefore  when rates increase  they can invest this cash at higher rates  thereby leading to a rise in interest income Brokerage firm like E TRADE Financial Corp    NASDAQ ETFC   derives nearly 60  of its total revenue from interest income  Another major brokerage house that stand to benefit is TD Ameritrade Holding Corp    NASDAQ AMTD    as its business is largely tied with receiving interest on cash which is highly sensitive to short term rates Further  the low rate environment had forced several firms like The Charles Schwab Corp    NYSE SCHW   to waive fees in order to maintain positive return for clients  However  the rising rate environment would reverse the trend

153028,374544,ETFC,Interactive Brokers Group Traces A Bearish Harmonic,opinion,"My assessment is purely based on the price action on the weekly charts  Take a look  The chart for E TRADE Financial Corporation  NASDAQ ETFC   although it has a cool symbol in its name is pulling back from a top 3 weeks ago  The current week may print a doji  signalling indecision  if the current action keeps up  but the Relative Strength Index  RSI  is falling at the mid line and the MACD has crossed down  With the 38 2  retracement of the move higher still far below  it needs to prove it wants to change direction 
The Charles Schwab Corporation  NYSE SCHW   is in the same boat  Testing the bottom of a rising channel  but with the RSI making a lower low and the MACD crossed down and continuing to fall  You could try it long here on a tight stop around 25 25 looking for a bounce at the channel  but again  I would prefer some proof or a reversal 

Interactive Brokers Group Inc  IBKR O   chart is a stark contrast  Having pulled back and made a double bottom  the price action is actually tracing out a bearish Shark harmonic  but with a Potential Reversal Zone  PRZ  above at 24 52  The RSI has found a bottom and is rising and the MACD is leveling after the pullback  If you want a brokerage stock  Interactive Brokers should be the one  Maybe they will give me some free trades for this
