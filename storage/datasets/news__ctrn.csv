There is close association of the Andretti brand  IndyCar race demographics and hhgregg s Fine Lines target customers  With hhgregg serving as the primary sponsor of Marco s entry at several IndyCar races  it will also align with Fine Lines markets  This therefore provides the opportunity to execute hhgregg and Fine Lines brand activations  Further  the expansion of these Fine Lines high performing retail format stores will strengthen hhgregg s position in the appliance category

Strong Q2 Results
The Bentonville  AR based retailer reported encouraging second quarter fiscal 2017 results  wherein both earnings and revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate  While revenues increased on a year over year basis owing to an improvement in comps  earnings witnessed a decline  Though the company reported higher sales at Wal Mart U S   a drop in sales at the international business and Sam s Club resulted in the year over year fall in earnings  Unfavorable currency and higher investments in wages and e commerce activities took a toll on the company s results 
Nevertheless  Wal Mart has been making efforts to understand the evolving needs of its customers to regain their confidence  and thus boost sales  It has delivered positive comps in the U S  in the last eight consecutive quarters  Sam s Club comps  excluding the impact of fuel sales  also inched up 0 6  in the reported quarter compared with 1 3  growth in the prior year quarter  Lower fuel prices aided sales by easing consumers  spending power  E commerce has also contributed to the company s comp sales 
Operating income grew 1 6  to  6 17 billion in the second quarter  This includes a gain of  535 million from the sale of Yihaodian  Excluding this gain  consolidated operating income declined 7 2  as the company continued to invest in people and technology  Higher investment in e commerce initiatives in order to compete with online retailer Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   and in associates through higher wages and training seem to have dampened operating income  along with negative currency WAL MART STORES Price and Consensus
    Guidance
The company has updated its fiscal 2017 guidance to reflect the sale of Yihaodian  Wal Mart now expects its earnings in the range of  4 15  4 35 per share  up from  4 00  4 30 estimated earlier  Earnings are  however  anticipated to be lower than  4 57 per share posted in fiscal 2016  The decline in year over year growth is due to higher wages and increased spending on e commerce activities 
The company expects full year effective tax rate at the low end of the previously stated range of 31 5  to 33 5  
Wal Mart currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

remaining nearly flat at 37 3   Strong merchandise margins were offset by currency headwinds Operating income plunged 24 4  to  279 million  while the operating margin declined 230 basis points  bps  to 7 2   mainly owing to elevated operating expenses  However  marketing expenses remained almost flat at  131 million in the reported quarter FinancialsGap ended the reported quarter with cash and

with the pace of business growth witnessed in the second quarter  These factors  along with the tough environment in the apparel industry  caused management to trim its fiscal 2016 earnings outlook  The company now envisions adjusted earnings for the fiscal year to range from  1 87  1 92 per share  compared with  1 92 predicted earlier  The guidance also compares unfavorably with the current

26722,248237,CTRN,Nike And 3 Other Retail Stocks To Avoid This Summer ,opinion,The performance of the Retail sector has been unpleasant of late as the sector continues to battle a tough retail environment  thanks to heightened competition  sluggish mall traffic due to rise of e commerce and weak margins  This was pretty obvious with the dismal quarterly results of retailers in the just past quarter  which led them to provide bleak outlook for 2016 Also  the challenging industry background seems to have crept into the current quarter  as earnings for the S P 500 stocks in the Retail sector are projected to be down 0 7  on 0 2  fall in margins   For a detailed look at the earnings trend for this sector and others  please read our latest  report What makes this clearer is the mixed fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results of leading athletic apparel retailer NIKE Inc    NYSE NKE   on Jun 28  While Nike continued its positive earnings streak with 16th consecutive beat  revenues marked the third consecutive quarterly miss  This sent the stock down 4  in the after hours session that day  Additionally  the Nike stock has lost about 7  year to date NIKE INC B Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The negative investor reactions after the earnings release were primarily due to the third consecutive sales miss as well as a slowdown in future orders  Sales were hurt by currency headwinds while future orders lagged expectations due to stiff competition from rivals which weighed in on the demand for Nike s basketball shoes Going into fiscal 2017  Nike expects currency woes to linger and affect results  aggravated by Brexit which has increased the volatility of global currencies  As a result of which  the company expects revenue in the first half of fiscal 2017 likely to suffer a stronger impact from the fluctuating currencies than the latter half  Consequently  the company provided a bleak outlook for first quarter fiscal 2017 Going by the company s expectations  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 also trended down in the last 30 days  The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Moving on  we will take a look at three other retail stocks that are underperforming and should no longer be a part of one s portfolio First  beware of specialty casual apparel retailer Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF   that has lost nearly 28  year to date and holds a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   After three straight quarters of positive earnings surprises  Abercrombie slipped to a loss in first quarter fiscal 2016  Also  the loss was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  the company s sales missed expectations and fell year over year owing to soft traffic trends in international markets as well as its U S  flagship and tourist stores  Management expects the fiscal second quarter to remain challenging  which will result in lower comparable store sales and gross margin ABERCROMBIE Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents and  1 11 for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 has declined 3 cents and 6 cents respectively over the past 30 days  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter has decreased to a loss of 21 cents from loss of 20 cents over the same time frame Next  Nordstrom Inc    NYSE JWN   is a sure no  The stock price of this fashion specialty retailer has plunged roughly 16  year to date  This Zacks Rank  5 stock continued its dismal earnings trend into fiscal 2016 as first quarter top and bottom lines lagged estimates for the third time in a row  This represents an average negative surprise of 15 7  over the trailing four quarters  Moreover  a competitive retail landscape and consumers  cautionary approach while purchasing discretionary items  have been weighing on the stock s performance NORDSTROM INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 55 and  2 87 for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 has dropped 2 cents and 46 cents respectively over the past 60 days  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter has decreased 13 cents to 55 cents over the same time frame Last but not the least  avoid Citi Trends Inc    NASDAQ CTRN    a value priced retailer of urban fashion apparel and accessories  This Zacks Rank  5 company posted its third straight sales and earnings miss  representing a negative earnings surprise of 5 7  in the trailing four quarters  Further  the company expects its average units sold to remain under pressure in fiscal 2016  Following the drab results  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents and  1 29 for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 has decreased 27 cents and 2 cents respectively over the past 60 days  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter has decreased to a loss of 5 cents from earnings of 4 cents over the same time frame  The stock has plunged nearly 19  year to date CITI TRENDS INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise  ,2016-07-12,Zacks

26728,248243,CTRN,Urban Outfitters  Namesake Brand Falls  Others Contribute,opinion,"Sales at Urban Outfitters Inc  s  NASDAQ URBN  namesake brand continue to decline and weigh upon the company s bottom line  While Anthropologie and Free People brands contributed to the company s performance  sales were affected to some extent by the sluggish Urban Outfitters brand performance on account of weak product execution  After falling 5 2  in the first quarter of fiscal 2015  sales at Urban Outfitters brand declined 2 4  in the second quarter  However  it is noteworthy that performance has improved sequentially 
In the recently concluded second quarter  Urban Outfitters  total net sales increased 7  on higher non comparable store sales  new store openings and double digit growth at its wholesale operations  The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Quarterly earnings of 49 cents a share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but dropped 3 9  from 51 cents delivered in the year ago quarter 
We believe that the company is trying all means to bring the brand back to the growth trajectory  and remains committed to improve comparable store sales performance  sustain investments in direct to consumer business  enhance productivity in existing channels  add new brands and optimize the inventory level  Going forward  the company intends to increase store count  grow wholesale operations  enhance direct penetration and augment e commerce activities 
However  fashion obsolescence remains the key concern for Urban Outfitters  business model  which includes sustained focus on product and design innovation  The taste and preferences of people are ever changing  and thus there remains a challenge to constantly revamp its assortment for fear of losing market share against other big players which may pour more trendy collections into the market 
The pros and cons embedded in the stock are well reflected in its Zacks Rank  3  Hold
