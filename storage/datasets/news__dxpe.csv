1577,223092,DXPE,5 Industrial Stocks Set To Surge In 2020 After A Solid 2019  Revised ,opinion,The industrial sector performed impressively in 2019 despite the fact that the U S  economy is yet to recover from trade related jitters  The economy has also lost its pace although it is growing for the 11th year on the trot  In spite of these negatives  several industrial stocks skyrocketed in 2019  Some of those stocks still carry strong growth potential for 2020 Trade War Hurts Business SpendingLingering trade conflict with China has resulted in tariff war wherein duties have been levied on hundreds of billion dollars on each other s goods  The U S  government has already levied 25  tariff on more than  300 billion of Chinese goods mostly used as cheap inputs for the technology and industrial sectors  On the other hand  China imposed tariffs on more than  100 billion U S  products mainly from the agricultural sector Imposition of tariff on China made low cost intermediary products raised the input cost of U S  manufacturers  Consequently U S  business spending dropped significantly in 2019  The Institute of Supply Management reported that U S  manufacturing activities contracted the most in December 2019 in more than a decade Industrial Sector Shines Despite HeadwindsDespite several headwinds  industrial stocks have performed quite strongly in 2019  The Industrial Select Sector SPDR  XLI   one of the 11 broad sectors of the S P 500 Index  rallied nearly 29  in 2019  in line with the benchmark index s gain  Notably  the XLI has started 2020 from where it ended in 2019 as it is already up 2 3  in the first six trading days Interim Trade Deal  A Major DriverChinese officials are set to arrive in Washington on Jan 13 in order to sign an interim trade pact known as the phase one trade deal  Last week  Donald Trump said that he will sign the preliminary trade deal on Jan 15  The deal is expected to at least prevent further escalation of tariff war between the two largest trading countries of the world U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the deal will address intellectual property disputes along with strong enforcement provisions and financial services and currency issues in addition to tariff rollback and higher agricultural purchase  Notably  China has reportedly agreed to substantially raise its agricultural imports from the United States to  40 billion On Dec 23  The Wall Street Journal reported that China s cabinet has agreed to lower tariffs for all trading partners on more than 859 types of products including pharmaceuticals  frozen pork and some high tech components to below the rates that the most favored nations enjoy A defusing of U S  China trade tussle will not only help these two countries  but also revive the global economy  especially the emerging markets and the sagging Eurozone  This in turn will raise demand for U S  exports  particularly its manufacturing and high tech products Our Top

quarters  the average positive beat being 13 15   It has an estimated long term earnings growth rate of 6 5  UnderpricedLooking at Terex s price to earnings ratio  shares are underpriced at the current level  which seems to be attractive for investors  The company has a trailing P E ratio of 8 3  which is below the industry average of 13 1 Growth DriversTerex has made considerable progress in its strategic transformation plan  consisting three principal elements   Focus  Simplify and Execute to Win  While the Focus element calls for increased investments on high performing businesses  the Simplify aspect focuses on complexity reduction and cost management  The Execute to Win is focused on three key management processes   talent development  strategy development and deployment  and operational excellence In line with this  Terex sold the Demag mobile crane business and exited the mobile crane product lines manufactured at Oklahoma City facility  in a bid to improve its operating performance Terex s segments are poised to grow on several initiatives  Its AWP segment will gain from strategic source and savings  operational execution  strengthening global footprint and innovative new products over the long haul  The segment continues to improve sales in the Asia Pacific region and China  fueled by increasing product adoption  The utilities business will gain from the new manufacturing facility being built in Watertown  SD  which will increase capacity and significantly improve productivity In the MP segment  the company continues to invest in India to capitalize on the country and the surrounding markets  prospects  Its solid product pipeline and continued execution also position the segment well for growth  Moreover  the company continues to follow a disciplined capital allocation strategy while investing in future growth and creating additional value for shareholders  Few Headwinds to CounterWhile the global market uncertainty has been weighing on the Terex s MP segment  the AWP segment is bearing the brunt of sluggish demand in the major markets  straining sales volume  Thus  the company is cutting down production and managing inventory levels to align with demand  which will impact margins unusually  Moreover  lower volume  adverse foreign exchange rates and product mix will weigh on margins for the current year Considering the overall slowdown in industrial equipment demand and impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates  Terex has lowered its earnings per share guidance to  3 00  3 20 on net sales of  4 4

Glass revenues have been impacted by lower volumes stemming from increased competition from overseas competitors and some customer driven delays  For the segment  the company expects revenue growth in the mid to upper single digits in fiscal 2020  It lowered full year margin outlook for the segment to approximately 6  from prior expectation of 7   primarily due to reduced leverage on lower volumes Additionally  Apogee is likely to incur approximately  4 million to  5 million of total start up costs for the new Architectural Glass growth initiative  So far this year  the company has incurred  2 9 million of start up costs for this initiative  Consequently  the segment s margins in fiscal 2020 are anticipated to be hurt by 100 to 150 basis points   Further  the segment s revenues are being

Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Lawson Products Inc    NASDAQ LAWS    Crawford United Corp    OTC CRAWA    SPX FLOW Inc    NYSE FLOW    Graphic Packaging Holding Co    NYSE GPK   and DXP Enterprises Inc    NASDAQ DXPE   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  5 Industrial Stocks Set to Surge in 2020 After a Solid 2019The industrial sector performed impressively in 2019 despite the fact that the U S  economy is yet to recover from trade related jitters  The economy has also lost its pace although it is growing for the 11th year on the trot  In spite of these negatives  several industrial stocks skyrocketed in 2019  Some of those stocks still carry strong growth potential for 2020 Tarde War Hurts Business SpendingLingering trade conflict with China has resulted in tariff war wherein duties have been levied on hundreds of billion dollars on each other s goods  The U S  government has already levied 25  tariff on more than  300 billion of Chinese goods mostly used as cheap inputs for the technology and industrial sectors  On the other hand  China imposed tariffs on more than  100 billion U S  products mainly from the agricultural sector Imposition of tariff on China made low cost intermediary products raised the input cost of U S  manufacturers  Consequently U S  business spending dropped significantly in 2019  The Institute of Supply Management reported that U S  manufacturing activities contracted the most in December 2019 in more than a decade Industrial Sector Shines Despite HeadwindsDespite several headwinds  industrial stocks have performed quite strongly in 2019  The Industrial Select Sector SPDR  XLI   one of the 11 broad sectors of the S P 500 Index  rallied nearly 29  in 2019  in line with the benchmark index s gain  Notably  the XLI has started 2020 from where it ended in 2019 as it is already up 2 3  in the first six trading days Interim Trade Deal  A Major DriverChinese officials are set to arrive in Washington on Jan 13 in order to sign an interim trade pact known as the phase one trade deal  Last week  Donald Trump said that he will sign the preliminary trade deal on Jan 15  The deal is expected to at least prevent further escalation of tariff war between the two largest trading countries of the world U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the deal will address intellectual property disputes along with strong enforcement provisions and financial services and currency issues in addition to tariff rollback and higher agricultural purchase  Notably  China has reportedly agreed to substantially raise its agricultural imports from the United States to  40 billion On Dec 23  The Wall Street Journal reported that China s cabinet has agreed to lower tariffs for all trading partners on more than 859 types of products including pharmaceuticals  frozen pork and some high tech components to below the rates that the most favored nations enjoy A defusing of U S  China trade tussle will not only help these two countries  but also revive the global economy  especially the emerging markets and the sagging Eurozone  This in turn will raise demand for U S  exports  particularly its

1615,223130,DXPE,5 Industrial Stocks Set To Surge In 2020 After A Solid 2019,opinion,The industrial sector performed impressively in 2019 despite the fact that the U S  economy is yet to recover from trade related jitters  The economy has also lost its pace although it is growing for the 11th year on the trot  In spite of these negatives  several industrial stocks skyrocketed in 2019  Some of those stocks still carry strong growth potential for 2020 Tarde War Hurts Business SpendingLingering trade conflict with China has resulted in tariff war wherein duties have been levied on hundreds of billion dollars on each other s goods  The U S  government has already levied 25  tariff on more than  300 billion of Chinese goods mostly used as cheap inputs for the technology and industrial sectors  On the other hand  China imposed tariffs on more than  100 billion U S  products mainly from the agricultural sector Imposition of tariff on China made low cost intermediary products raised the input cost of U S  manufacturers  Consequently U S  business spending dropped significantly in 2019  The Institute of Supply Management reported that U S  manufacturing activities contracted the most in December 2019 in more than a decade Industrial Sector Shines Despite HeadwindsDespite several headwinds  industrial stocks have performed quite strongly in 2019  The Industrial Select Sector

is already up 2 3  in the first six trading days Interim Trade Deal  A Major DriverChinese officials are set to arrive in Washington on Jan 13 in order to sign an interim trade pact known as the phase one trade deal  Last week  Donald Trump said that he will sign the preliminary trade deal on Jan 15  The deal is expected to at least prevent further escalation of tariff war between the two largest trading countries of the world U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the deal will address intellectual property disputes along with strong enforcement provisions and financial services and currency issues in addition to tariff rollback and higher agricultural purchase  Notably  China has reportedly agreed to substantially raise its agricultural imports from the United States to  40 billion On Dec 23  The Wall Street Journal reported that China s cabinet has agreed to lower tariffs for all trading partners on more than 859 types of products including pharmaceuticals  frozen pork and some high tech components to below the rates that the most favored nations enjoy A defusing of U S  China trade tussle will not only help these two countries  but also revive the global economy

1646,223161,DXPE,TriMas  TRS  Rides On Strong Product Pipeline  Costs High,opinion,On Jan 8  we issued an updated research report on TriMas Corporation   NASDAQ TRS    Although the company will gain from strong pipeline of product and process innovation in the long haul  the current weakness in industrial and upstream oil and gas end markets will weigh on the top line in the near term  Higher freight costs and commodity costs are likely to impact margins  Nevertheless  the TriMas Business Model aimed at improving management and performance of businesses will drive results  Weaker Than Expected Q3 TriMas reported adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share in third quarter 2019  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents and also declined 8  from the prior year quarter  This can be attributed to rising freight costs  higher effective tax rate and weak end market conditions that impacted certain product lines Sluggish Markets to Impact 2019 Results During the third quarter conference call  the company lowered earnings per share guidance to  1 75  1 80 from the prior  1 85  1 95  This reflects expectations of continued lower end market demand and less favorable product mix in certain businesses  Considering the impact of Lamons sale  TriMas anticipates full year 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of  1 40 to  1 45  The company is scheduled to report fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 results on Feb 27  Demand levels in many of TriMas  end markets are being impacted by uncertainties related to the U S China trade war  This along with the ongoing weakness in the North American industrial markets will weigh on the Packaging segment s top line  Moreover  higher freight and logistic costs will continue to limit margins in the days ahead  The company projects organic sales growth guidance for the segment at 0 1   down from the prior guidance of 3 5   while operating margin is anticipated in the range at 20 21   down from the prior 21 22    Persistent soft demand in the upstream oil and gas end market as a result of lower oil and gas extraction activity in the United States and Canada  and reduced demand for large high pressure steel cylinders thanks to the softer industrial end markets will continue to weigh on the Specialty Products segment s sales  Higher freight costs will deter margins  The company expects the segment s sales to grow 3 4   down from the prior projection of 4 6   The segment s margin is now projected at 9 11   down from its prior expectation of 11 13   However  the Aerospace segment is expected to fare better in 2019 backed by strong quoting activity  order intake and new business wins  For 2019  the company anticipates achieving sales growth of 4 5  while operating margins are envisioned in the band of 16  to 17   Initiatives to Counter Cost Inflation in Place The company s results are being impacted by higher commodity costs  particularly steel  aluminum and oil based commodities  It also has to contend with increased tariffs on imported goods  TriMas plans to counter the impact of higher commodity costs and the impact of tariffs through commercial actions  supply chain management  leveraging global manufacturing footprint and continued management of businesses under the TriMas Business Model Other Growth DriversTriMas will continue to focus on leveraging the TriMas Business Model  which was implemented in late 2016 to improve management and performance of businesses  Its innovative solutions through product  process or service  and extensive resources will help enhance business performance  The company also has a strong pipeline of both product and process innovation that will sustain long term growth and position its businesses to capitalize on market opportunities and minimize market disruptions TriMas has divested Lamons business  which is in sync with its strategy to streamline businesses  This will reduce the company s exposure to the energy related end market and allow it to focus on the Packaging and Aerospace reportable segments  The net proceeds will be utilized for investing in business  and mergers and acquisitions  M A   Notably  the divestment supports TriMas  effort to restructure portfolio by investing in innovation  Further  it will enable M A to accelerate long term growth  primarily in the Packaging and Aerospace segments Even after acquisitions and share repurchases  the company s leverage ratio was at 1 5x at third quarter 2019 end  below the target of 2 0x  The company ended third quarter 2019 with cash and available liquidity of  342 million  For 2019  TriMas anticipates free cash flow to be higher than 100  of net income  Its strong balance sheet and track record of strong cash flow generation poise it well and provides both ample capacity and flexibility to fund capital allocation priorities  Share Price Performance Shares of TriMas have gained 16 4  over the past year  compared with the  s rally

in the market  a relatively less used metric called EV EBITDA is often viewed as a better option as it offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential  Unlike P E that solely considers a company s equity portion  EV EBITDA determines its total value Also dubbed as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents EBITDA is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it strips out non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more enticing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued   However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another key downside of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  Moreover  a firm s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Meanwhile  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA positive Moreover  EV EBITDA is a useful tool in assessing the value of companies that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  The ratio also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels Then again  EV EBITDA has its flaws  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements As such  instead of solely banking on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks For the rest of this

1664,223179,DXPE,Why Hold Strategy Is Apt For Dover  DOV  Stock Right Now,opinion,Dover Corporation   NYSE DOV   has been displaying an impressive performance  aided by an upbeat outlook  improved performance by the Engineered Systems and Fluids segments  strong demand and solid backlog as well as cost reduction initiatives  However  weak retail refrigeration demand and input cost inflation due to the tariff impositions remain concerns Factors Favoring DoverUpbeat GuidanceDover s fourth quarter 2019 results are likely to reflect its robust order backlog as well as execution of margin targets  In addition  impressive performance in the Engineered Systems and Fluids segments  along with benefits from cost containment actions  footprint optimization projects and retail refrigeration  are likely to have negated the impact of soft demand in the Refrigeration   Food Equipment segment The company projected adjusted EPS at  5 82  5 85 for 2019  The mid point of the guidance suggests 17  year over year growth  The guidance reflects solid order backlog across all business segments  productivity and cost initiatives  and execution of margin targets Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryDover outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the trailing four quarters  the average positive earnings surprise being 6 7  Price PerformanceThe stock has appreciated around 65 2  over the past year  outperforming the  s growth of 39  Strong Earnings Growth ProspectThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dover s 2020 earnings is currently pegged at  6 29  reflecting expected year over year growth of 7 6   Also  the stock has a long term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11 5  UnderpricedLooking at Dover s price to earnings ratio  shares are underpriced at the current level  which seems attractive for investors  The company has a trailing P E ratio of 19 8  which is lower than the industry average of 22 4 Growth Drivers in PlaceDover continues its efforts to simplify the company s portfolio and increase focus on markets with growth prospects  In sync with this  it has completed the spin off of the upstream energy businesses  Following the spin off  the company no longer owns the Energy segment and is aligned into three reportable segments  Consequently  Dover s core platforms  which compete in lower volatility industrial markets  will be well poised to provide a robust foundation for reinvestment  long term sustainable revenues  earnings growth and strong free cash flow generation Dover s cost reduction initiatives are likely to boost its margins  The company has executed restructuring programs to better align costs and operations with the current market conditions through targeted facility consolidations  headcount reduction and other measures Dover also has a long tradition of making successful acquisitions in diverse end markets  Moreover  the company will gain from product digitization  e commerce  new product development  and inorganic investment in core business platforms Few Hurdles to CounterTariff impositions on steel and aluminum products have led to higher input costs for Dover  Additionally  Dover s Refrigeration   Food Equipment segment has been bearing the brunt of soft retail refrigeration markets  The segment s margin has been affected by lower volumes in the SWEP heat exchanger business  notably in Asia and reduced refrigeration systems demand  Thus  weak refrigeration demand and lower shipments in Asia will likely dampen margins in the near term  Considering these  Dover s Refrigeration   Food Equipment segment revenues will likely remain soft Bottom LineInvestors might want to hold on to the stock  at present  as it has ample prospects for outperforming peers in the near future Zacks Rank   Stocks

1703,223218,DXPE,Is U S  Manufacturing Showing Signs Of Recovery  5 Top Picks,opinion,The U S  manufacturing industry  which faced severe challenges in 2019 owing to the lingering trade conflict and tariff war with China  is showing signs of recovery  Moreover  2020 should bring good tidings as the two countries recently agreed to sign a phase one deal to resolve the tariff war in the first half of January U S  Manufacturing Showing Signs of ImprovementOn Dec 17  the Department of Commerce reported that industrial production jumped 1 1  in November  surpassing the consensus estimate of 0 8  and reversing a 0 9  reduction in October  November s metric marks the biggest gain in more than two years Notably  within overall industrial production  manufacturing output jumped 1 1  in November supported by a 12 4  gain in production of cars and trucks and related parts  Excluding this component  industrial production and manufacturing output grew 0 5  and 0 3  in the last month Overall  industrial production rose 2 1  for consumer goods and 1 7  for business equipment  Additionally  capacity utilization  which is a measure of how firms are using their resources  increased to 77 3  to 76 6 in October  However  the metric is still below the pre recession level of 80   This will prevent production cost and prices to rise exorbitantly   Is Slowdown in Business Spending Bottoming Out The imposition of tariff on China made  low cost intermediary products raised the input cost of U S  manufacturers  Consequently  U S  business spending dropped significantly in 2019  The Institute of Supply Management reported that U S  manufacturing activities contracted for four consecutive months from August to November On Nov 27  the Department of Commerce reported that new orders for manufactured durable goods increased  1 5 billion or 0 6  to  248 7 billion in October  More important information from the report was that the core durable goods order  which excludes defense aircraft  jumped 1 2  in October The core durable goods data for October indicate that business spending is likely to continue although the pace may decline considerably  Therefore  stabilization of business investment in October will act as a relief to the manufacturing sector  Additionally  new orders for core capital goods is a leading metric to calculate equipment spending in the U S  government s GDP measurement  Notably  manufacturing activities constituted nearly 12  of U S  GDP U S China Phase One Trade DealOn Dec 13  both United States and China declared that they have reached a phase one trade deal likely to be signed by the two presidents in the first half of January  Per the deal  the United States will reduce the tariff rate from 15  to 7 5  on  120 billion Chinese exports  Moreover  the Trump administration will also cancel the imposition of 15  tariff on fresh  160 billion Chinese products mainly used for making consumer goods On the other hand  China has pledged to purchase  40 billion agricultural products from the United States per year  U S  officials are still trying to raise the threshold to  50 billion per annum  Moreover  China will also rollback on some tariffs imposed on U S  exports  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the deal will address intellectual property issues along with strong enforcement provisions and financial services and currency issues Our Top PicksAt this stage  we have narrowed down our search to five manufacturing stocks that popped in 2019 and still have momentum for the next year  Each of

owing to the lingering trade conflict and tariff war with China  is showing signs of recovery  Moreover  2020 should bring good tidings as the two countries recently agreed to sign a phase one deal to resolve the tariff war in the first half of January U S  Manufacturing Showing Signs of ImprovementOn Dec 17  the Department of Commerce reported that industrial production jumped 1 1  in November  surpassing the consensus estimate of 0 8  and reversing a 0 9  reduction in October  November s metric marks the biggest gain in more than two years Notably  within overall industrial production  manufacturing output jumped 1 1  in November supported by a 12 4  gain in production of cars and trucks and related parts  Excluding this component  industrial production and manufacturing output grew 0 5  and 0 3  in the last month Overall  industrial production rose 2 1  for consumer goods and 1 7  for business equipment  Additionally  capacity utilization  which is a measure of how firms are using their resources  increased to 77 3  to 76 6 in October  However  the metric is still below the pre recession level of 80   This will prevent production cost and prices to rise exorbitantly   Is Slowdown in Business Spending Bottoming Out The imposition of tariff on China made  low cost intermediary products raised the input cost of U S  manufacturers  Consequently  U S  business spending dropped significantly in 2019  The Institute of Supply Management reported that U S  manufacturing activities contracted for four consecutive months from August to November On Nov 27  the Department of Commerce reported that new orders for manufactured durable goods increased  1 5 billion or 0 6  to  248 7 billion in October  More important information from the report was that the core durable goods order  which excludes defense aircraft  jumped 1 2  in October The core durable goods data for October indicate that business spending is likely to continue although the pace may decline considerably  Therefore  stabilization of business investment in October will act as a relief to the manufacturing sector  Additionally  new orders for core capital goods is a leading metric to calculate equipment spending in the U S  government s GDP measurement  Notably  manufacturing activities constituted nearly 12  of U S  GDP U S China Phase One Trade DealOn Dec 13  both United States and China declared that they have reached a phase one trade deal likely to be signed by the two presidents in the first half of January  Per the deal  the United States will reduce the tariff rate from 15  to 7 5  on  120 billion Chinese exports  Moreover  the Trump administration will also cancel the imposition of 15  tariff on fresh  160 billion Chinese products mainly used for making consumer goods On the other hand  China has pledged to purchase  40 billion agricultural products from the United States per year  U S  officials are still trying to raise the threshold to  50 billion

carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and has a market capitalization of approximately  14 7 billion Below we discussed why it will be prudent for investors to hold on to this stock for now Factors Favoring XylemTop Line Strength  The company serves customers in various end markets   including industrial  commercial  residential and utilities  This diversification helps Xylem to deal with weakness in some markets  with strength in others  For 2019  organic sales in the utility end market are predicted to increase in a mid to high single digit  higher than the previously mentioned mid single digit growth  Also  strength in emerging markets  wastewater and the water market in the United States  and growth prospects in infrastructure analytics and smart meter will be beneficial  In the commercial end market  organic sales are predicted to grow in a mid single digit Notably  the company s organic revenues grew 5  on strengthening end markets  especially utilities  in the second quarter of 2019  Also  healthy performances were recorded in China  India and the United States In the past three months  the company s share price has gained 2 2  compared with the  s growth of 0 6  Shareholder Friendly Policies  Xylem effectively uses capital for rewarding shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks  It is worth mentioning here that the company hiked the quarterly dividend rate by 14  in January 2019  In the first half of 2019  it paid out dividends amounting to  87 million and bought back shares worth  39 million For 2019  Xylem anticipates rewarding shareholders with dividend payouts of  175 million  Share count at the end of the year is expected to be approximately 181 million Long Term Growth Prospects  Rising demand  spurred by the water sector s digitization and investments in technological capabilities  are tailwinds for Xylem  Backed by these and other factors  the company is on track to achieve most of its long term targets As discussed at its investor day in 2017  Xylem targets organic growth of 4 6  and adjusted operating margins of 17 18  by 2020  Adjusted earnings per share are likely to be in mid teens and capital that can be used for deployment is expected to total  3 5 billion Factors Working Against XylemOver Valued Stock and Earnings Estimates  The company s shares currently seem overvalued compared with the industry  using the P E  TTM  valuation method  The stock s three month P E multiple is 25 53x  higher than the industry s multiple of 20 03x  Also  the stock is currently trading higher than the industry s three month multiple of 20 50x  This makes us cautious about the stock In addition  the company s earnings estimates have been declined in the past 30 days  Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings is pegged at  3 17 for 2019 and  3 64 for 2020  reflecting declines of 1 6  and 2 2  from the respective 30 day ago figures Xylem Inc  Price and Consensus    Lowered Projections  For 2019  Xylem s organic sales in the industrial end market are predicted to be adversely impacted by weak business in the Middle East and Europe  softness in China  and moderation in the U S  general industry  Also  businesses will be soft in the oil and gas mining market  Industrial organic sales will likely grow in a low single digit  down from previously mentioned low to mid single digit range In addition  the residential market will likely suffer from softness in European markets and the dwindling U S  housing market  Residential organic sales are predicted to be flat to up in a low single digit  down from the previously stated low single digit growth For 2019  Xylem predicts revenues of  5 29  5 38 billion versus the previously stated  5 3  5 4 billion  Also  adjusted earnings per share are predicted to be down from  3 12  3 32 mentioned earlier to  3 12  3 22  with the mid point declining from  3 22 to  3 17 Forex   Cost Woes  Geographical diversification is reflective of a flourishing business of the company  However  this diversity exposed it to headwinds arising from geopolitical issues and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  In the second quarter of 2019  forex woes adversely impacted the company s sales growth by 3  and earnings by one cent per share  Persistence of such headwinds will continue impacting its top line results Also  cost inflation and investments adversely impacted Xylem s operating margin in the second quarter of 2019  We believe that rising costs and expenses  if unchecked  will continue to hurt the company s margins in the quarters ahead Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the industry are Graham Corporation   NYSE GHM    DXP Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ DXPE   and Roper Technologies  Inc    NYSE

1824,223339,DXPE,Here s Why It Is Worth Holding On To Ingersoll Rand Stock Now,opinion,We have issued an updated research report on Ingersoll Rand plc   NYSE IR   on Aug 9 This industrial machinery maker currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its market capitalization is approximately  28 8 billion Below we discussed why it will be prudent for investors to hold on to this stock for now  Factors Favoring Ingersoll Rand Share Price Performance  Earnings Projections  Market sentiments seem to be working in favor of the company over time  In the past six months  its share price has gained 14 2   higher than the  s growth of 4 7  We believe that impressive financial results helped in driving sentiments for the stock  The company recorded positive earnings surprise of 2  in the second quarter of 2019  On a year over year basis  earnings expanded 13  on solid revenue growth  margin expansion and lower taxes For 2019  Ingersoll Rand anticipates gaining from strengthening revenue performance  effective operating system and execution capabilities  Also  investments toward innovation  technology and footprint optimization initiatives to trim costs will be beneficial  It projects adjusted earnings per share of roughly  6 40 in 2019  higher from the previously stated  6 35 Further  the company s earnings estimates have been raised in the past 30 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings is pegged at  6 39 for 2019  reflecting 0 2  growth from the 30 day ago figure Ingersoll Rand PLC  Ireland  Price and Consensus    Top Line Strength  The company provides services through two business segments   Climate Solutions and Industrial Technologies  These segments have operations in various end markets  especially non residential HVAC  heating  ventilation and air conditioning   residential HVAC  electric vehicles   industrial products  and transport markets For 2019  Ingersoll Rand believes that healthy growth in non residential HVAC markets in China  North America and Europe will be beneficial  Also  solid backlog  orders rates and pipeline will likely support performance in the second half of 2019  The residential HVAC market will gain from business in North America  Small electric vehicle   industrial product markets will be advantageous too  Transport business will be healthy in North America but weakness might be seen in Europe For 2019  the company anticipates revenues to increase 5 5 6 5   higher than 4 5  mentioned earlier  Organic sales growth is maintained at 5 6  Capital Allocation Policies  The company effectively uses capital for making acquisitions and growth investments as well as rewarding shareholders handsomely through dividend payments For instance  the company acquired ICS Cool Energy in January 2018 while entered a joint venture with Mitsubishi Electric Corporation   with equal partnership in Mitsubishi Electric Trane HVAC   in May  In addition  Precision Flow Systems was acquired in May 2019  This particular buyout  predicted to support the company s existing fluid management business  is likely to boost sales by 1 5   or  250 million  in 2019 With regard to shareholders  reward  the company distributed  259 4 million as dividend payouts and repurchased shares worth  250 million in the first half of 2019  It is worth noting here that Ingersoll Rand announced an 18  hike in the quarterly dividend rate in June 2018  Also  it received approval for  1 5 billion worth share buyback program in October 2018  The company anticipates repurchasing shares worth  500 million in 2019 Factors Working Against Ingersoll RandOver Valued Stock  Ingersoll Rand s shares currently seem overvalued compared with the industry  using the EV EBITDA  TTM  valuation method  The stock s six month EV EBITDA multiple is 14 06x  higher than the industry s multiple of 12 28x  Also  the stock is currently trading higher than the industry s six month multiple of 12 97x  This makes us cautious about the stock Higher Costs and Expenses  Ingersoll Rand s cost of sales  and selling and administrative expenses grew 4 4  and 4   respectively  in the second quarter of 2019  Operating margin in the quarter suffered from adverse impacts of material inflation resulting from business investments  tariffs and other inflationary pressures For 2019  the company noted that tariff related headwinds  including the recent List 3 tariffs applied on China imports  and material related inflationary pressure will be concerning  However  effective pricing and productivity measures will be boon  Corporate expenses in the year are predicted to be  250 million Long Term Debt  Ingersoll Rand s long term debts were  4 920 6 million at the end of the second quarter of 2019  reflecting an increase of 31 5  from 2018 end  In March 2019  the company raised funds through the issuance of senior notes  With relation to this offering  it predicts interest expenses to be  60 million  with roughly  47 million likely to be incurred in 2019 We believe that the company s highly leveraged balance sheet might be detrimental as it increases financial obligations and hurt profitability Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the industry are Graham Corporation   NYSE GHM    DXP Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ DXPE   and Dover Corporation   NYSE DOV    All these stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  In the past 60 days  earnings estimates for these stocks improved for the current year  Further  earnings surprise for the last reported quarter was 100  for Graham

a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and has a market capitalization of approximately  24 7 billion Below we discussed why it will be prudent for investors to hold on to this stock for now  Factors Favoring CintasShare Price Performance  Earnings Projections  Market sentiments seem to be working in favor of Cintas over time  In the past six months  the company s share price has gained 41 8   higher than the  s growth of 38 4  We believe that impressive financial results helped in driving sentiments for the stock  In third quarter fiscal 2019  ended February 2019   Cintas recorded positive earnings surprise of 7 60   Its share has increased 13 6  since the results released on Mar 21  2019  Also  it pulled off average positive earnings surprise of 6 09  for the last four quarters For fiscal 2019  ended May 2019  results not yet released   the company anticipates gaining from solid customer base  focus on product portfolio enhancement  effective implementation of enterprise resource planning system and synergistic gains from buyouts will be advantageous  Earnings per share in the year is predicted to be  7 42  7 48  up from the previously announced  7 30  7 38 Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s earnings is pegged at  7 46 for fiscal 2019 and  8 30 for fiscal 2020  ending May 2020   On a year over year basis  these estimates reflect growth of 25 6  for fiscal 2019 and 11 2  for fiscal 2020 Cintas Corporation Price and Consensus    Shareholder Friendly Policies  The company effectively uses capital for rewarding shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks  It is worth mentioning here that it increased the annual dividend rate by 26 5  in October 2018 In the first nine months of fiscal 2019  ended February 2019   the company repurchased shares worth  608 2 million and paid dividends totaling  220 8 million Buyouts  Cintas seems to favor acquisitions to fortify its product portfolio  In fiscal 2018  ended May 2018   the company strengthened its Uniform Rental and Facility Services segments with five acquisitions while First Aid and Safety Services with three acquisitions  Also  it made six acquisitions under the All Other segment Further  the company added G K Services Inc  to its portfolio in March 2017  Since then  the buyout has been strengthening its Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment  This buyout has been a revenue driver and it is predicted to yield significant cost synergies going forward It is worth mentioning here that Cintas invested approximately  7 4 million in making acquisitions in the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 Factors Working Against CintasValuation  The company s shares currently seem overvalued compared with the industry it belongs to  In the past six months  its price earnings multiple of 32 38 has been higher than the industry s multiple of 30 67  Notably  this metric is trading higher than the industry s three month highest level of 30 67  This makes us cautious about the stock High Costs Trouble  The company has been suffering from higher costs and expenses  In the third quarter of fiscal 2019  its cost of sales increased 4 3  on a year over year basis  Costs related to hangers  rising wages and those related to effective implementation of enterprise resource planning system might be the main reasons behind higher costs The company believes that expenses related to enterprise resource planning system and integrations expenses of the G K Services buyout will be troublesome in the quarters ahead  G K Services integration costs are predicted to be  16 million in fiscal 2019 Highly Leveraged Balance Sheet  In the last five fiscal years  2014 2018   Cintas  long term debt grew 14 3   CAGR   The metric at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was approximately  2 5 million We believe that a highly leveraged balance sheet might be detrimental to the company  as it raises financial obligations and pressures margins

first quarter 2019 margin by 100 basis points while similar contributions are predicted for the full year  Shareholder Friendly Policies  The company effectively uses capital for making acquisitions  growing investments and rewarding shareholders handsomely  For rewards  it pays dividends and buys back shares  It is worth mentioning here that it increased the quarterly dividend rate by 28  and announced a  3 billion share buyback program in August 2018 In the first quarter of 2019  the company repurchased shares worth  375 million and paid dividends totaling  328 million  In 2019  it

likely to be  14 5  14 8 billion  down from  14 8  15 billion mentioned earlier  Forex   Cost Woes  Geographical diversification is reflective of a flourishing business of the company  However  this diversity exposed it to headwinds arising from geopolitical issues and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  In the first quarter of 2019  forex woes adversely impacted its sales growth by 3 4  and earnings by 7 cents per share The company predicts forex woes to adversely impact earnings by 6 cents per share in the second quarter of 2019 Also  it predicts that high tax rate will be troubling

1901,223416,DXPE,5 Industrial Stocks To Bet On Despite Trade War Jitters,opinion,The pace of growth in the U S manufacturing sector was the slowest in two and half years in May  primarily affected by the escalating trade war concerns between the United States and China  Per the Institute for Supply Management s latest report  Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  for May came down to 52 1  from 52 8  registered in April and also fell short of the market expectations of 53  The manufacturing index has plunged from the high of 60 8  in August 2018 and is currently languishing at its lowest levels over the past 12 months  The latest reading reflects weakest pace of expansion in the manufacturing sector since October 2016 as production growth slumped to its weakest since August 2016 and backlog of orders contracted for the first time since January 2017 The New Orders Index registered 52 7  in May  up from 51 7  in April  The sector has witnessed growth in new orders for the 41 straight months  Backlog of Orders Index was 47 2  in May  lower than the 53 9  reported in April   the lowest level of performance since October 2016  Production Index was 51 3  in the month  dropping from 52 3  in April but still continues to improve for 33 straight months  The employment index was pegged at 53 7   up from the April reading of 52 4  and sustaining growth for the 32nd consecutive month The implementation of tariffs on steel imports into the United States last year dealt a severe blow to the manufacturing stocks  Given that steel is a primary raw material  every company involved in manufacturing bore the brunt of rising steel prices owing to tariffs  Though this can be mitigated to some extent with price increases  it might not always be feasible to pass on the price increase to customers Recently  the Trump administration announced that it will impose a 5  tariff on all imported goods from Mexico beginning June 10  Trump plans to gradually increase that tax to 25  until the flow of undocumented immigrants across the border stops  This new concern regarding a U S  trade dispute with Mexico along with the ongoing U S  trade war with China have traders and investors on tenterhooks  Further  the industry has been plagued with shortage of skilled laborers  higher wage costs and flaring up transportation expenses for quite some time now Despite the dip in May  the PMI has averaged 57 7  over the last 12 months  Notably  a reading above 50  indicates expansion in manufacturing sector  This suggests that the sector is holding its own amid the headwinds Improvement in residential and non residential construction as well as infrastructure demand will fuel the sector s performance  Mining companies are also resuming their capital spending on the back of improvement in commodity prices  Further  the recently passed tax reform has been acting as a catalyst by expediting manufacturing investment in factories  new equipment and other capital goods  Moreover  the manufacturing companies will continue to combat cost inflation through pricing actions  cost control  increasing productivity and eliminating waste  which will sustain margins Sector PerformanceDespite the abovementioned headwinds  the Zacks  sector has rallied 13  year to date  while the S P 500 witnessed growth of 12 1  Earnings for the Industrial Products Sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  rose 1 2  in the first quarter of 2019 amid input cost inflation  Per the latest  report  the sector is expected to log a decline of 1 3  in earnings in the second quarter of 2019  However  the decline is not limited to this sector alone  In the June end quarter  nine of the 16 Zacks Sectors are expected to witness drop in earnings  In fact  the Industrial Sector s decline is

1914,223429,DXPE,Middleby  MIDD  Displays Bright Prospects  Risks Persist,opinion,"On Jun 13  we issued an updated research report on The Middleby Corporation   NASDAQ MIDD   
In the past six months  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has gained 21 9  compared with the  s increase of 18 1  

Existing Scenario
Middleby is well poised to gain from increased demand from the domestic restaurant chain customers  and strength in beverage end market  It will also benefit from strong demand for automated conveyor and ventless cooking equipment 
Further  a robust Viking business and solid demand for major branded products like AGA and Rangemaster will likely boost near term revenues of the Residential Kitchen Equipment segment  In addition  the company expects new product innovations to improve its top line 
Also  the acquisition of Standex International Corporation s Cooking Solutions Group  closed in April 2019  is predicted to solidify its existing product portfolio of cooking products  In addition  the buyout of Powerhouse Dynamics  closed in April 2019  will complement Middleby s Connect IoT platform  and will help in serving customers efficiently  Moreover  the M TEK Corporation buyout  closed in October 2018  has been strengthening the company s business footprint in the global industrial food processing market 
The company s continuous focus on supply chain  and investments in broadening its product portfolio  technologies and manufacturing capabilities are likely to further improve profitability and production efficiencies 
However  Middleby is currently dealing with rising costs of sales  In the first quarter of 2019  its cost of sales jumped 15 1  year over year while it increased 11 5   CAGR  in the last five years  2014 2018   Notably  material cost inflation  on account of tariffs  is escalating the company s aggregate costs of late  Rising costs  if unchecked  will likely dent the company s margins in the quarters ahead

approximately  14 1 billion market capitalization  Presently  it carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  A few growth drivers  as well as certain headwinds  which might influence Xylem  have been discussed below  Factors Favoring XylemSegmental Performance and Outlook  The company operates through three business segments   Water Infrastructure  Applied Water  and Measurement   Control Solutions  Its revenues increased 1 6  year over year in the first quarter of 2019 on the back of sales growth in all three segments  Organically  sales grew 7  for Water Infrastructure  driven by strength in transport and treatment businesses  expanded 7  for Applied Water  driven by growth in commercial  industrial water and residential businesses  and improved 5  for Measurement   Control Solutions  driven by growth in the water business For 2019  the company projects revenues to increase 2 4  year over year to  5 3  5 4 billion  Organic sales are predicted to increase 4 6   including 5 7  for Water Infrastructure  3 5  for Applied Water  and 4 6  for Measurement   Control Solutions Strengthening Business  Xylem serves a large number of customers in end markets  including utilities  industrial  commercial and residential  Business from utilities end markets generated the largest share of revenues for the company in 2018 Notably  Xylem performed in all the end markets in the first quarter of 2019  with organic sales increasing 6  in utilities  4  in industrial  12  in commercial and 4  in residential end markets  For 2019  the company anticipates organic sales to grow in a mid single digit in the utilities end market  in a mid single digit  higher than the previously stated low  to mid single digit  in commercial  low  to mid single digit in industrial and low single digit in residential Shareholder Friendly Policies  Xylem believes in rewarding its shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks  In 2018  dividend payments totaled  152 million

announced by Xylem in January 2019  Also  the company anticipates distributing dividends of  175 million and predicts share count to be approximately 181 million in 2019 Factors Working Against XylemShare Price Performance and Poor Valuation  Xylem reported weaker than expected results for the first quarter of 2019  with earnings and sales lagging respective estimates by 10 3  and 1   The company s share price has declined 3 5  since the earnings release on May 2 Notably  the stock price has increased 3 9  in the past three months versus the  s growth of 4  Also  the stock currently seems overvalued compared with the industry  considering the Price to Earnings  P E  multiple for the past three months  The stock s P E  TTM  multiple is 26 5x  above the industry s 20 6x and the industry s three month highest level of 20 6x  This overvaluation somewhat makes us cautious about the stock  Projections Lowered  Xylem s first quarter results suffered from adverse impacts of unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  rise in costs and operating expenses  and weak margins  Notably  the company stated that cost inflation adversely impacted adjusted operating margin by 3 2 percentage points while growth investments impacted margin by 80 bps  However  effective pricing actions were a relief For 2019  Xylem lowered its adjusted earnings per share guidance from  3 20  3 40 to  3 12  3 32  Also  adjusted operating margin is predicted to be 14 5 14 9   down from the previously mentioned 14 7 15 2   The downward revision was due mainly to weak first quarter results and forex woes We believe that poor first quarter performance and lowered guidance for 2019 created bearish sentiments for the stock  In the past 30 days  earnings estimates for the stock have been revised down by 2 7  to  3 24 for 2019 and by 2 1  to  3 74 for 2020 Xylem Inc  Price and Consensus    Huge Debts and Forex Woes  Xylem s highly leveraged balance sheet   with long term debt pegged at roughly  2 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2019   if unchecked  can inflate its financial obligations and prove detrimental to profitability  It predicts that it will incur interest expenses of  72 million in 2019 Also  geographical diversification exposed the company to headwinds  arising from geopolitical issues and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  Forex woes lowered first quarter 2019 earnings by 5 cents per share and sales by 4   For 2019  the company predicts that forex woes will dilute earnings by 4 cents Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in

Factors Favoring ColfaxFinancial Performance   Outlook  Results for the first quarter of 2019 surpassed estimates  with positive earnings beat of 8 2   Profitability gained from acquired assets  growth in existing businesses and margin improvement  Including the results  its average earnings surprise for the last four quarters was 9 16  In the first half of 2019  the company anticipates

Segmental Business  Colfax operates through three segments  namely Air and Gas Handling  Fabrication Technology  and Medical Technology  Through these platforms  the company serves a vast customer base in oil   gas  general industrial  mining  marine  and many other end markets In the first half of 2019  the company anticipates Air   Gas Handling  and Fabrication Technology segments to perform well  For the year  core sales of Air   Gas Handling are predicted to grow in a mid to high single digit and that of Fabrication Technology is expected to expand in a mid single digit Acquisitions  Colfax believes in making acquisitions for boosting the product portfolio and expanding operations in international arenas  Notably  acquisitions added 19 2  to sales growth in the first quarter of 2019 In 2018  the company acquired and added Sandvik Materials Technology s welding wire operations and Gas Control Equipment to its Fabrication Technology segment as well as made two buyouts for its Air   Gas Handling segment  In February 2019  the company completed the acquisition of DJO Global  which marked  Colfax s entry into the orthopedic solutions industry In the first half of 2019  the company predicts that DJO Global and other acquisitions will boost results Factors Working Against ColfaxShare Price Performance and Earnings Estimate Revision  Market sentiments are against Colfax for quite some time now  In the past three months  the company s shares have declined 1 5  against the  s growth of 4 5   It is worth noting that the decline of 3 9  was recorded in the share price after the release of earnings results for the first quarter of 2019 on May 8 In addition  it can be observed that analysts have become bearish on the company s growth prospects  In the past seven days  four downward revisions and one upward revision have been recorded for 2019 earnings estimates while two downward revisions and three upward revisions have been recorded for 2020 Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s earnings is pegged at  2 60 for 2019 and  2 92 for 2020  reflecting declines of 0 4  and 1  from the respective seven day ago numbers Colfax Corporation Price and

Higher debts also increased the company s interest expenses by 203 7  year over year in the quarter  Furthermore  its total debt total capital was 115 6  at the end of the first quarter of 2019 versus 34 5  at the end of fourth quarter 2018 We believe that such a highly leveraged balance sheet seems to be a concern for Colfax as it inflates financial obligations and hurts profitability Forex Woes  Geographical diversification  with presence in the United States  Europe  Asia  the Middle East and South America  is reflective of a flourishing business of the company  However  this diversity exposed it to headwinds arising from geopolitical issues and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  In the first quarter of 2019  forex woes adversely impacted sales growth by 6 4  The company

featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY    ANI Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ANIP    DXP Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ DXPE    Foot Locker  Inc    NYSE FL   and ACI Worldwide  Inc    NASDAQ ACIW   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  American Economy Hits the Gas  5 Top GainersThings are rather gloomy around the globe  South Korea s economy has shrunk and Japan s economy is not showing promising growth  Further  Germany is barely expanding  affecting an already ailing Eurozone  Amid all this  the U S  economy is standing tall  U S  economic growth was stronger than expected in the first quarter  mostly backed by inventory and trade components that offset slowdowns in consumer and business spending  This bolstered hopes that the economy is in sound shape after its recent soft patch  Let us  thus  look at stocks that can make the most of the strength in the U S  economy Boom Time for the U S  EconomyAccording to the Commerce Department  the U S  economy expanded at a 3 2  annual pace in the January March period  the best first quarter growth since 2015  The gain was well above analysts  expectations of a 2 3  increase in gross domestic product  GDP   Such encouraging growth followed a 2 2  advance in the prior three months  President Trump also cheered the GDP growth saying that the numbers were  far higher than the high expectations  Acceleration in GDP was primarily due to two typically volatile components   inventories and trade  The value of inventories jumped to  128 4 billion from  96 8 billion  while the trade sector added a little more than 1  to GDP s growth in the first quarter  Exports climbed nearly 4   but sluggish domestic demand dragged imports down by almost 3 7   leading to a smaller trade deficit  In fact  this was the first time since 2013 when inventories and trade together boosted GDP numbers At the same time  increase in both state and local government spending fueled GDP growth  Spending improved 3 9  after a decline of 1 3  in the prior three months Offsetting these gains to some extent  however  were consumer spending and business investment numbers  Consumer spending  which accounts for almost 70  of U S  economic activity  rose a meager 1 2  in the first quarter  down from 2 5  gain in the quarter before  Business fixed investments decelerated to a 2 7  gain from a 5 4  gain in the prior quarter  Investment in new housing was another weak spot Beyond the NumbersThe major factors behind the first quarter GDP growth may be temporary  This is because global trade collapsed in the three months to February  with world trade volume contracting 1 9   the sharpest plunge since May 2009  Thus  the United States can t rely on net exports to propel growth in the near term And when it comes to inventories  any increase does signal that companies expect demand to rise and also that unsold goods are piling up due to drop in demand  So  the inventory measure definitely doesn t tell us much about the underlying strength in business activity  Finally  when you ignore the volatile trade and inventories components  private sector spending gained a mere 1 3   the weakest quarterly growth since 2013 But  let s admit that the economy dispelled concerns of a slowdown on the horizon  It also shook off severe market volatility in recent times and recovered exceptionally well in the first quarter  It overcame headwinds including government shutdown in January and uncertainty about tax refunds  indicating that the economy is well poised to gain in the long run Some other recent reports have also pointed to signs of strength  March retail sales  surprise jump of 1 6  does indicate that consumer spending will eventually improve and a proxy for business investment has risen sharply  Headline durable goods orders expanded at 2 7  last month  easily surpassing estimates  In fact  durable goods orders grew at the fastest pace in seven months  Similarly  core orders gained 0 4  compared to a month earlier  And when it comes to housing  the sector is set to gain steam on the back of lower mortgage rates and more affordable properties 5 Top GainersWith the U S  economy showing enough signs of strength as well as poised to gain further  investing in fundamentally sound companies at this moment seems judicious  These companies are financially stable enough to gain from a healthy economy  We have zeroed

2024,223539,DXPE,American Economy Hits The Gas  5 Top Gainers,opinion,Things are rather gloomy around the globe  South Korea s economy has shrunk and Japan s economy is not showing promising growth  Further  Germany is barely expanding  affecting an already ailing Eurozone  Amid all this  the U S  economy is standing tall   U S  economic growth was stronger than expected in the first quarter  mostly backed by inventory and trade components that offset slowdowns in consumer and business spending  This bolstered hopes that the economy is in sound shape after its recent soft patch  Let us  thus  look at stocks that can make the most of the strength in the U S  economy  Boom Time for the U S  Economy According to the Commerce Department  the U S  economy expanded at a 3 2  annual pace in the January March period  the best first quarter growth since 2015  The gain was well above analysts  expectations of a 2 3  increase in gross domestic product  GDP    Such encouraging growth followed a 2 2  advance in the prior three months  President Trump also cheered the GDP growth saying that the numbers were  far higher than the high expectations    Acceleration in GDP was primarily due to two typically volatile components   inventories and trade  The value of inventories jumped to  128 4 billion from  96 8 billion  while the trade sector added a little more than 1  to GDP s growth in the first quarter   Exports climbed nearly 4   but sluggish domestic demand dragged imports down by almost 3 7   leading to a smaller trade deficit  In fact  this was the first time since 2013 when inventories and trade together boosted GDP numbers   At the same time  increase in both state and local government spending fueled GDP growth  Spending improved 3 9  after a decline of 1 3  in the prior three months  Offsetting these gains to some extent  however  were consumer spending and business investment numbers  Consumer spending  which accounts for almost 70  of U S  economic activity  rose a meager 1 2  in the first quarter  down from 2 5  gain in the quarter before  Business fixed investments decelerated to a 2 7  gain from a 5 4  gain in the prior quarter  Investment in new housing was another weak spot  Beyond the Numbers The major factors behind the first quarter GDP growth may be temporary  This is because global trade collapsed in the three months to February  with world trade volume contracting 1 9   the sharpest plunge since May 2009  Thus  the United States can t rely on net exports to propel growth in the near term  And when it comes to inventories  any increase does signal that companies expect demand to rise and also that unsold goods are piling up due to drop in demand  So  the inventory measure definitely doesn t tell us much about the underlying strength in business activity   Finally  when you ignore the volatile trade and inventories components  private sector spending gained a mere 1 3   the weakest quarterly growth since 2013  But  let s admit that the economy dispelled concerns of a slowdown on the horizon  It also shook off severe market volatility in recent times and recovered exceptionally well in the first quarter  It overcame headwinds including government shutdown in January and uncertainty about tax refunds  indicating that the economy is well poised to gain in the long run  Some other recent reports have also pointed to signs of strength  March retail sales  surprise jump of 1 6  does indicate that consumer spending will eventually improve and a proxy for business investment has risen sharply   Headline durable goods orders expanded at 2 7  last month  easily surpassing estimates  In fact  durable goods orders grew at the fastest pace in seven months  Similarly  core orders gained 0 4  compared to a month earlier  And when it comes to housing  the sector is setto gain steam on the back of lower mortgage rates and more affordable properties  5 Top Gainers With the U S  economy showing enough signs of strength as

consecutive quarter of an earnings beat  Average earnings surprise for the last four quarters was a positive 3 15  In the past three months  the company s shares have increased 13   above the  s growth of 10 9  The company anticipates gaining from initiatives  including growth  modernization and simplification  and strengthening end markets  For fiscal 2019  ending June 2019   adjusted

3 49 for fiscal 2020  reflecting year over year growth of 18 1  and 11 4   respectively Kennametal Inc  Price and Consensus    Tactical Initiatives  Kennametal has undertaken various restructuring initiatives over time  Its head count reduction and other miscellaneous programs  completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2018  ended September 2018   yielded roughly  3 million in pre tax savings in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and approximately  12 million in the first half of fiscal 2019 In addition  the company s three initiatives   including growth  modernization and simplification   are proving beneficial  While growth initiative is boosting sales through improvement in commercial execution  the simplification initiative helped in improving operational efficiency and lowering costs  The modernization initiative is currently in progress and is contributing to strong operating leverage  Notably  these initiatives boosted the company s bottom line by 10 cents in second quarter fiscal 2019 Long Term Prospects  Diversified customer base and solid footprint in various end markets   including aerospace  automotive  machine tool  farm machinery  highway construction  coal mining  quarrying  and oil and gas exploration industries   remain beneficial for Kennametal in the long run  Also  its above mentioned initiatives are boons By fiscal 2021  ending June 2021   the company

depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  will likely be  600  675 million and EBITDA margin will be 24 26   Adjusted operating margin is expected to be 19 21  Factors Working Against KennametalHigher Costs  Over time  higher costs of sales have been creating problems for Kennametal  On a year over year basis  the metric increased 4 3  and 1 8  in the fiscal first quarter and second quarter  respectively  The increase in costs was mainly due to rise in manufacturing costs  in some locations  and higher raw material costs For fiscal 2019  inflation in raw material costs remains a concern  In unchecked  higher costs and operating expenses will prove detrimental to the company s margins and profitability Long Term Debt  Kennametal s long term debt was at  591 7 million at the end of second quarter fiscal 2019  reflecting marginal increase over the previous quarter and fiscal 2018  Interest expenses in the reported quarter reflected 12 1  year over year growth We believe that fresh issuances of debt instruments will increase this balance and in turn  inflate the company s financial obligations  In unchecked  high debt levels can prove detrimental to its profitability in the quarters ahead Forex Woes  Geographical diversification is reflective of a flourishing business of Kennametal  However  this diversity exposed the company to headwinds arising from geopolitical issues and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  In second quarter fiscal 2019  forex woes adversely impacted sales by 3   Persistence of fluctuation in foreign currencies will continue to adversely impact Kennametal s financials Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the Zacks  sector are DXP Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ DXPE    Sun Hydraulics Corporation   NASDAQ SNHY   and

2105,223620,DXPE,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  CBRE  DXP  EZCORP  G III And Heidrick   Struggles,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  April 3  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  CBRE Group  Inc    NYSE CBRE    DXP Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ DXPE    EZCORP  Inc    NASDAQ EZPW    G III Apparel Group  Ltd    NASDAQ GIII   and Heidrick   Struggles International  Inc    NASDAQ HSII   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 5 Best Stocks to Own This AprilU S  stocks started off April on a strong note as better than expected manufacturing numbers from both the United States and China eased global growth concerns  The Fed s accommodative measures coupled with a rise in oil prices added to the positive sentiments  Needless to say  the month of April has time and again proved to be favorable for stocks Thus  it s time to invest in stocks that are likely to make the most of the favorable month April  Typically StrongApril  traditionally  has been a good month for stocks  especially  if the stocks gained in the first quarter  LPL Financial noted that since 1950  the broader S P 500 moved north in 15 out of 19 years during the month  especially when January  February and March were all positive  In fact  the average gain for April in all those years was 2 6  And this time around  we can well expect April to be a solid one for investors since Wall Street just posted its strongest quarterly rise in a decade  with the broader S P 500 index rising 13 1  in the first quarter and marking its best start to a year since 1998  The index also successfully notched its biggest one quarter gain since 2009 But  it s just not the S P 500 that started off well this year  Other major bourses  including the Dow Jones Industrial Average  Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks  rose more than 11  Marc Chaikin  founder of Chaikin Analytics  chipped in  April has been up 80  of the time over the past 20 years   The Stock Trader s Almanac also added that April has historically been a strong month for stocks  going back to World War II  The Dow Jones  the S P 500 and theNasdaq Composite gained an average of around 1 9   1 5  and 1 4   respectively Latest Manufacturing Figures are Heartening All three major U S  stock market indexes  by the way  are already off to a good start boosted by reassuring factory data from both the United States and China  American manufacturing rebounded in March after slipping to a two year low in the prior month  Per the Institute for Supply Management  the manufacturing index came in at 55 3  last month compared with 54 2  in February  An index number above 50 indicates expansion However  the latest reading can be termed as normal growth rather than unusually strong growth  After all  the 12 month average is still at the lowest since May 2017  Nonetheless  employment rebounded strongly  indicating that the manufacturing index s comeback has been primarily backed by domestically focused activities China s official Purchasing Managers Index also made a stellar comeback in March  rising to a six month high of 50 5 from 49 2 in February  Beijing took enough steps including cutting taxes to stimulate its manufacturing activities  China has already announced stimulus of about  250  120 billion  which will be mostly used in infrastructure spending  China s economic outlook is of utmost importance for global recovery  as the country has been responsible for weakness in global demand over the past three quarters Fed s Dramatic Policy Shift The Fed s dovish stance adopted in January has convinced market pundits that there won t be any rate hikes this year  Inflation has remained relatively contained  U S  consumer prices increased marginally in February  supporting the case for the Fed to hold off further rates  The consumer price index increased 1 5  from year ago levels  while core inflation that excludes volatile items like food and energy costs  rose 2 1   The Fed stated that the central bank will stick to its patient stance on monetary policy as long as core inflation continues to be near 2  Such views were widely considered as accommodative measures  at least for the time being  and have been soothing for investors  After all  the Fed s rate increase last year had taken a toll  This is because hike in rates increases the cost of lending money from financial institutions for small and medium business houses and in turn exerts more pressure on the U S  economy Oil s Epic RallyRise in oil prices  in the meantime  has eased worries about global economic growth  The U S  oil price benchmark  West Texas Intermediate  climbed 32  during the first quarter to nearly  60 a barrel after Saudi Arabia led OPEC cut supplies to prevent a glut Lest we forget  U S  oil price is still down nearly 20  from last October s high of more than  76 a barrel  This shows the extent of beating U S  oil price had taken at the end of last year  Nevertheless  oil prices are widely expected to gain traction as OPEC s output has again slipped in March for the fourth straight month  led by production cuts by Saudi Arabia 5 Solid ChoicesCourtesy of a positive historical trend  upbeat March figures on manufacturing from both the United States and China  Fed s patient stance for interest rates hikes and rise in oil prices  we are set for a strong April rally  The U S  economy  by the by  continues to expand at a steady pace with record low levels of unemployment Hence  it will be prudent to invest in five of the best stocks that can make the most of this promising

Earnings Estimate Revision  Stanley Black   Decker reported in line results for the fourth quarter of 2018  Its earnings in the quarter declined 3 2  year over year due to higher costs of sales

industrial activities  housing markets and overall economic growth of the United States  and foreign nations served For 2019  the company expects Industrial segment s organic sales growth to be flat

tariffs and commodity inflation offsetting the positive aspects  Higher Costs and Forex Woes  Stanley Black   Decker s cost of sales increased 105  in the fourth quarter of 2018  mainly due to commodity inflation  and unfavorable impacts of foreign currency movements and tariffs  Gross and operating margins were down 280 bps and 10 bps  respectively  from the year ago quarter  We believe

Black   Decker s long term debt balance at the end of the fourth quarter was  3 819 8 million  reflecting sequential increase of 34 9   We believe that further issuances of debt  to fund either buyout

2145,223660,DXPE,5 Best Stocks To Own This April,opinion,U S  stocks started off April on a strong note as better than expected manufacturing numbers from both the United States and China eased global growth concerns  The Fed s accommodative measures coupled with a rise in oil prices added to the positive sentiments  Needless to say  the month of April has time and again proved to be favorable for stocks Thus  it s time to invest in stocks that are likely to make the most of the favorable month April  Typically StrongApril  traditionally  has been a good month for stocks  especially  if the stocks gained in the first quarter  LPL Financial noted that since 1950  the broader S P 500 moved north in 15 out of 19 years during the month  especially when January  February and March were all positive  In fact  the average gain for April in all those years was 2 6  And this time around  we can well expect April to be a solid one for investors since Wall Street just posted its strongest quarterly rise in a decade  with the broader S P 500 index rising 13 1  in the first quarter and marking its best start to a year since 1998  The index also successfully notched its biggest one quarter gain since 2009 But  it s just not the S P 500 that started off well this year  Other major bourses  including the Dow Jones Industrial Average  Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks  rose more than 11  Marc Chaikin  founder of Chaikin Analytics  chipped in  April has been up 80  of the time over the past 20 years   The Stock Trader s Almanac also added that April has historically been a strong month for stocks  going back to World War II  The Dow Jones  the S P 500 and theNasdaq Composite gained an average of around 1 9   1 5  and 1 4   respectively Latest Manufacturing Figures are Heartening All three major U S  stock market indexes  by the way  are already off to a good start boosted by reassuring factory data from both the United States and China  American manufacturing rebounded in March after slipping to a two year low in the prior month  Per the Institute for Supply Management  the manufacturing index came in at 55 3  last month compared with 54 2  in February  An index number above 50 indicates expansion However  the latest reading can be termed as normal growth rather than unusually strong growth  After all  the 12 month average is still at the lowest since May 2017  Nonetheless  employment rebounded strongly  indicating that the manufacturing index s comeback has been primarily backed by domestically focused activities China s official Purchasing Managers Index also made a stellar comeback in March  rising to a six month high of 50 5 from 49 2 in February  Beijing took enough steps including cutting taxes to stimulate its manufacturing activities  China has already announced stimulus of about  250  120 billion  which will be mostly used in infrastructure spending  China s economic outlook is of utmost importance for global recovery  as the country has been responsible for weakness in global demand over the past three quarters Fed s Dramatic Policy Shift The Fed s dovish stance adopted in January has convinced market pundits that there won t be any rate hikes this year  Inflation has remained relatively contained  U S  consumer prices increased marginally in February  supporting the case for the Fed to hold off further rates  The consumer price index increased 1 5  from year ago levels  while core inflation that excludes volatile items like food and energy costs  rose 2 1   The Fed stated that the central bank will stick to its patient stance on monetary policy as long as core inflation continues to be near 2  Such views were widely considered as accommodative measures  at least for the time being  and have been soothing for investors  After all  the Fed s rate increase last year had taken a toll  This is because hike in rates increases the cost of lending money from financial institutions for small and medium business houses and in turn exerts more pressure on the U S  economy Oil s Epic RallyRise in oil prices  in the meantime  has eased worries about global economic growth  The U S  oil price benchmark  West Texas Intermediate  climbed 32  during the first quarter to nearly  60 a barrel after Saudi Arabia led OPEC cut supplies to prevent a glut Lest we forget  U S  oil price is still down nearly 20  from last October s high of more than  76 a barrel  This shows the extent of beating U S  oil price had taken at the end of last year  Nevertheless  oil prices are widely expected to gain traction as OPEC s output has again slipped in March for the fourth straight month  led by production cuts by Saudi Arabia 5 Solid ChoicesCourtesy of a positive historical trend  upbeat March figures on manufacturing from both the United States and China  Fed s patient stance for interest rates hikes and rise in oil prices  we are set for a strong April rally  The U S  economy  by the by  continues to expand at a steady pace with record low levels of unemployment Hence  it will be prudent to invest in five of the best stocks that can make the most of this promising

company  with a market capitalization of  11 2 billion  currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  A few growth drivers and certain headwinds  which might influence IDEX  have been discussed below  Factors Favoring IDEXFinancial Performance   Share Price Movements  IDEX has a history of delivering positive earnings surprises  with a beat of 3 15  registered in fourth quarter 2018  Average earnings beat for the last four quarters is a positive 5 42  It is worth mentioning here that the company s earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018 grew roughly 17  year over year on the back of increase in revenues and benefits from productivity initiatives  The company is hopeful of delivering impressive results in 2019  gaining from solid product portfolio  diversified business structure and execution abilities  It anticipates generating adjusted earnings of  5 60  5 80 per share for the year  reflecting increase of 4 7  from the previous year Post the earnings release on Jan 29  the company s share price gained 6 3   It has risen 17 9  in the past three months compared with the  s growth of 15 2   Top Line Performance and View  In the fourth quarter of 2018  strengthening businesses in industrial  water  energy  food and pharma end markets supported 5  growth in organic sales  Orders improved 2  organically on the back of growth in Fluid   Metering Technologies  and Health   Science Technologies segments For 2019  IDEX anticipates roughly 4 5  growth in organic sales  which in turn is expected to boost earnings by 30 50 cents per share  Total revenues for the year will likely be  2 560  2 585 million  reflecting year over year growth of 3 4   Efficient Use of Capital  Growth investments  acquisitions and rewarding shareholders are three prime ways through which IDEX deploys capital  To begin with  acquisitions helped it in business expansion in unexplored markets and broadening of the product portfolio  For instance  the Phantom Controls buyout in June 2018 strengthened the Fire   Safety Diversified Products segment while the Finger Lakes Instrumentation buyout in July 2018 added vigor to the Health   Science Technologies segment It is worth mentioning that acquisitions divestitures had a positive 1  impact on sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 Regarding rewards to shareholders  the company distributed  127 5 million as dividends in 2018 while repurchased  173 9 million worth of shares  For 2019  it anticipates share count reduction to boost earnings per share by 6 cents  Factors Working Against IDEXPoor Valuation   Earnings Estimate Revision  On a Price Earnings  P E  basis  IDEX s shares appear overvalued compared with the industry  The stock is currently trading at 27 3x  higher than the industry s 20x  Its highest and lowest levels in the past three months are 28x and 22 4x  respectively Further  the stock s current valuation multiple is above the industry s three month highest level of 20 1x Regarding earnings estimates  four negative revisions have been recorded for 2019 against two positives in the past 60 days  For 2020 estimates  three positive and one negative revisions were made  Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  5 73 for 2019 and  6 13 for 2020  reflecting declines of 0 5  and 0 2  from the respective tallies 60 days ago IDEX Corporation Price and Consensus    High Costs and Debts  Rising cost of sales and operating expenses have been issues for IDEX over time  In the last five years  2014 2018   its cost of sales increased 2 6   CAGR  while operating expenses grew 1 3   CAGR   For the fourth quarter of 2018  higher engineering costs were mainly responsible for 4 7  increase in cost of sales For 2019  IDEX predicts corporate expenses to be approximately  80  84 million  Also  earnings headwind of 5 cents per share is estimated from growth investments  Notwithstanding these  we believe that the trade dispute between the United States and other foreign nations might be

2192,223707,DXPE,Here s Why It Is Worth Holding On To MRC Global  MRC  Now,opinion,We have issued an updated research report on MRC Global Inc    NYSE MRC   on Jan 11 This leading distributor of pipes  valves and fittings  PVF  to the energy industry currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its market capitalization is approximately  1 4 billion A few growth drivers and certain headwinds  which might influence MRC Global  have been discussed below  Factors Favoring MRC Global Diversified Business Operations  MRC Global operates through three reporting segments   U S   Canada and International  The U S  segment was the largest revenue contributor in the third quarter of 2018  accounting for the quarter s 80 2  sales  Operations in various geographical locations have been a boon for the company over time It s worth mentioning here that MRC Global serves a vast customer base in the energy and other markets  Prime industries served include exploration  production  and extraction of underground oil and natural gas  natural gas utilities  crude oil refining  petrochemical processing  and general In the quarters ahead  MRC Global anticipates gaining from increased oil   gas production in the United States  which has spurred demand for facility expansion and pipeline infrastructure  Also  ease of installing new pipelines  stability in natural gas  low cost  supply and many other factors are favorable for MRC Global  Contracts  MRC Global stands to gain from lucrative contract wins  multi year  and projects  In this regard  work on ten major transmission projects to offset the productivity shortfall in the Permian basin will be a boon for the company  These activities are anticipated to generate  150  200 million revenues in 2018 2020  In addition  contracts secured from Statoil  OL EQNR  in July 2017 and from Exxon  NYSE XOM  Mobile in March 2017 are expected to boost the company s top line performances In the third quarter of 2018  the company s U S  segment gained from new contracts secured in the downstream sector  Shareholder Friendly Policies  MRC Global believes in rewarding its shareholders handsomely through share buybacks  In the first nine months of 2018  the company used  50 million for repurchasing roughly 2 87 million common shares  This spending was higher than  18 million used in the first nine months of 2017 In October 2018  the company s board of directors authorized a  150 million buyback program  This program expires in December 2019  Factors Working Against MRC GlobalShare Price Performances and Poor Valuation  Market sentiments have been against MRC Global for quite some time now  In the past six months  the company s shares have declined 29 8   This fall is lower than the  s decline of 33  but worse than the S P 500 s decrease of 7 7   In the third quarter of 2018  the company s earnings of 20 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 04   This was the third dismal performance by MRC Global in the past four quarters  which had an average negative earnings surprise of 31 17  The company s stock appears overvalued compared with the industry  On a Price Earnings  P E  basis  the stock is currently trading at 31 6x  higher compared with the industry s 16 9x  Further  the stock s current valuation multiple is above the industry s highest levels of 20 2x for the past six months  Midstream Business  Weakness in midstream business had an adverse impact on MRC Global s third quarter top line results  Revenues generated from the midstream business decreased roughly 3  year over year  due mainly to weakness in sales generated from gas utility as well as transmission and gathering customers  We believe that such weakness  if persists  can continue to hamper the company s top line performances For the fourth quarter of 2018  MRC Global expects revenues to decline 4 7  sequentially  Revenues are likely to be above  1 billion  High LIFO Expenses  Lower Earnings Estimates  In the third quarter of 2018  MRC Global recorded 100  surge in its LIFO related expenses  These  26 million expenses adversely impacted the company s margins and profits in the quarter  For 2018  the company predicts LIFO related expenses to total  64 million  higher than  50 million mentioned earlier In the past 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at  59 cents for 2018  results not yet released  and  1 04 for 2019  The estimates reflect decline of 1 7  for 2018 and 4 6  for 2019 from the respective tallies 60 days ago MRC Global Inc  Price and Consensus

2018  results not yet released   healthy demand in end markets served  realignment initiatives and lower tax rates  of 27 28  versus 30  in 2017  will be beneficial  and aid bottom line growth  The company anticipates adjusted earnings of  1 65  1 75 per share  higher than  1 50  1 70 mentioned earlier and roughly 25   at the mid point  year over year Solid results and outlook also lifted sentiments for Flowserve  which is evident from positive revision in bottom line estimates  In the past 60 days  the stock s earnings estimates for 2018 have been raised by six brokerage firms while

 from the respective tallies 60 days ago  Further  bottom line estimates represent year over year growth of 28 7  for 2018 and 25 3  for 2019 Flowserve Corporation Price and Consensus    Solid Business Opportunities  Flowserve operates in various end markets   including power generation  chemical  general  and oil   gas  Strengthening demand in these markets is anticipated to be a boon for the company s top line growth  It s worth mentioning here that Flowserve predicts 5 7  revenue growth year over year in 2018  higher than 3 6  mentioned earlier As noted by Flowserve  pickup in liquefied natural gas related activities in North America  expanding pre FEED and FEED pipeline  and growing demand for maintenance and upgrade activities at refineries will benefit its operations in the oil   gas market  Further  improving demand and spurring investments in ethylene  and derivative facilities will support business in the chemical market while the growing thermal solar market will strengthen operations in the power market  In general industries  the company anticipates gaining from higher distribution activities  fueled by growing global economy Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s revenues is pegged at approximately  3 9 billion for 2018 and  4 1 billion for 2019  Estimates for 2019 represents year over year growth of 4 6  Long Term Prospects  Flowserve s multi year program  Flowserve 2 0  is anticipated to drive significant long term value for its shareholders  Moreover  the program will enable the company to create a better workplace for its employees and effectively support its customers  Further  it intends on combining the operations of its Industrial Product Division and Engineered Product Division under one head  Flowserve Pumps Division  The new division will help the company better control its operations and serve its customers in the global pumps market For four years from 2019 to 2022  Flowserve anticipates revenue growth of roughly 200 basis points  above the industry s growth rate  Operating margin is predicted to be 15 17  in 2022 and free cash flow is likely to be more than 100  of net income Factors Working Against FlowserveShare Price Performances and Poor Valuation  Market sentiments have been against Flowserve for quite some time now  Its stock price has decreased roughly 26 9  in the past three

three months  High Realignment Expenses  Divestiture Issues  Through transformational realignment program  Flowserve intends on reducing backlog  improving on time delivery  leveraging supplier relationships and enhancing sales process  However  these benefits will be realized in the long run  Currently  the company is dealing with expenses related to the realignment program  amounting to roughly  43 3 million in the first nine months of 2018  We believe that these expenses weigh on profitability  In addition  the company predicts that asset divestment will result in an adverse 1  impact on sales in 2018  Long Term Debt  Flowserve s long term debts in the last five years  2013 2017  increased 5 9   CAGR   Though the debt of  1 437 million at the end of the third quarter of 2018 reflects 1 3  decline from the previous quarter  we believe that further issuances are bound to increase the balance  The company s total debt total equity stood at 92 2  at the end of the third quarter If unchecked  high debt levels can prove detrimental to the company s margins and profitability in the quarters ahead Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the industry are DXP

Employers added 2 6 million jobs in 2018  more than 2 2 million added in 2017  Hiring in October and November were also way more than earlier reported  with 58 000 new jobs added to the 2018 total  Such a feat was achieved despite questions about employers  ability to find skilled labor and headwinds associated with slowdown in cyclical part of the economy  including housing The jobless rate  in the meantime  ticked up to 3 9  from 3 7   However  it still continues to languish at historically low levels  The real unemployment rate  including those who are underemployed and discouraged  also

 from 3 1   matching a post recession high set earlier in the year Courtesy of record wage growth  the consumer discretionary sector is  thus  poised to benefit significantly  After all  higher wage growth plays a significant role in driving consumer discretionary spending  Needless to say  among the economic factors that primarily impacts demand for consumer discretionary goods is wage growth

2261,223776,DXPE,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Fortune Brands  FBHS  Now,opinion,We issued an updated research report on Fortune Brands Home   Security  Inc    NYSE FBHS   on Dec 26 This security and safety service provider currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its market capitalization is approximately  5 1 billion Let s delve deeper and discuss the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds  Factors Favoring Fortune BrandsGrowth Through Buyouts  Over time  Fortune Brands easily penetrated unexplored markets  added products to portfolio and expanded geographical footprints with the help of acquired assets  In this regard  the buyout of Fiberon  LLC  in August 2018  is worth mentioning  The acquired assets will complement the company s existing door brand   Therma Tru  Further  it will help in enhancing its growth potential in outdoor living space  Earnings accretions of 5 6 cents per share in 2019 and 9 10 cents per share in 2020 are anticipated from the Fiberon buyout  Shareholder Friendly Policy  Fortune Brands effectively uses its cash flow to augment growth opportunities as well as reward shareholders handsomely  The company rewards its shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks  In the first nine months of 2018  it used  87 1 million for paying dividends and approximately  603 million for repurchasing shares Recently  the company hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 10    this being its 6th consecutive year of a dividend rate increase in double digits  Moreover  the company has share repurchase authorization of  505 7 million left from its  150 million and  400 million buyback programs approved in April and July 2018  respectively  Long Term Targets  Fortune Brands anticipates its Plumbing segment to contribute roughly 60  of the company s revenues  in excess of  3 billion  by 2021  Its Cabinets  Doors and Security segments are predicted to contribute roughly 25   roughly  3 billion   10   roughly  0 7 billion  and 5   roughly  0 7 billion   respectively  Earnings per share are likely to grow to approximately  6 00 in 2021 from  3 08 in 2017  Factors Working Against Fortune BrandsWoes From Rising Costs  Fortune Brands has been suffering from headwinds  arising from rising costs and expenses  In the first nine months of 2018  the company s cost of sales increased 5 6  year over year and its operating expenses grew roughly 6   It is worth mentioning here that the company s costs escalated due to higher material costs  owing to import tariffs and increasing freight charges Fortune Brands expects tariffs to adversely impact its results by  2  3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018  Further  tariff of 25  will likely impact results in 2019 greatly  Weak Earnings Estimates   Price Performance  Fortune Brands  average earnings surprise is negative 4 54   This average includes the impact of negative 11 43  earnings surprise recorded in the third quarter of 2018 For 2018  the company revised down its earnings projection from  3 62  3 72 per share to  3 41  3 49 per share  It believes that inflation in commodity prices  rising freight costs  Fiberon buyout related integration costs  softness in the Security segment and impact of bond financing to impact its results Additionally  earnings estimates on the stock have been revised down in the past couple of months  Estimates for 2018 were lowered by two brokerage firms while that for 2019 decreased by two and increased by one  Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  3 43 for 2018 and  3 86 for 2019  reflecting declines of 1 4  and 1 8  from the respective tallies 60 days ago Fortune Brands Home   Security  Inc  Price and Consensus    Furthermore  the company s stock price has decreased roughly 32 4  in the past three months versus the  s decline of 24 4   Other Headwinds  Fortune Brands  businesses are highly susceptible to natural calamities  Earnings in third quarter 2018 were adversely impacted by 7 cents per share due to hurricane Florence that disrupted the company s North Carolina operations  Further  its Plumbing business might witness some adverse impacts due to this in the quarters ahead A highly leveraged balance sheet can be concerning for Fortune Brands  In the last five years  2013 2017   the company s long term debt increased 33 9   CAGR  while grew roughly 31 9  from the 2017 level to roughly  2 billion at the end of third quarter 2018  We believe  if unchecked  high debt levels can inflate the company s financial obligations and put pressure on margins Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the Zacks  sector are Ituran Location and Control Ltd    NASDAQ ITRN    DXP Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ DXPE    and EnPro Industries  Inc    NYSE NPO    All these stocks currently sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  In the past 60 days  earnings estimates for each of these stocks improved for the current year  Further  positive earnings

For 2018  pricing actions  restructuring initiatives  improved productivity and lower tax rates will help in boosting bottom line results  The company anticipates earnings of  2 20  2 30 per share  a revised view from  2 15  2 30 mentioned earlier  At the mid point  the latest projection reflects year over year growth of at least 26  Solid results and outlook also lifted sentiments for the sock  which is evident from positive revision in bottom line estimates  In the past 60 days  the stock s earnings estimates for 2018 have been raised by five brokerage firms and lowered by three  Likewise  estimates for 2019 have been raised by seven firms and lowered by two  Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  2 25 for 2018 and  2 55 for 2019  Earnings estimates for 2018 reflect no change and estimates for 2019 reflect growth of 2  from respective 60 day ago tallies  Further  bottom line estimates represent year over year growth of 29 3  for 2018 and 13 2  for 2019

model provides some idea about the stocks that are about to release results  Per the model  a stock needs a combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 for a likely earnings beat  Growth Through Acquisitions  Over time  Colfax easily penetrated unexplored markets  added products to portfolio and expanded geographical footprints  with the help of acquired assets  The company recently decided to acquire orthopedic solutions provider  DJO Global Inc  for  3 15 billion  In the 12 months after the completion of the acquisition  Colfax anticipates earnings per share  adjusted  accretion from DJO Global  Moreover  it seeks to enjoy tax benefits from DJO Global s  800 million operating loss carryforwards Prior to this  Colfax acquired TBi  HKS and Siemens AG  DE SIEGn  s Siemens Turbomachinery Equipment GmbH business in 2017  Additionally  ACH Equipos Ltda  and Advanced Combustion Inc  were added to the company s portfolio in the third quarter of 2018 while Gas Control Equipment s buyout was completed in October this year In the third quarter of 2018  acquired assets added 7 3  to sales growth  Solid Business Opportunities  Colfax works through two platforms   Fabrication Technology  and Air   Gas Handling  Through these platforms  the company serves a vast customer base in the oil   gas  general industrial  mining  marine  and many others end markets  In the fourth quarter of 2018  the company anticipates continued growth in business and margin improvement versus the prior quarter in the Fabrication Technology segment  For the Air   Gas Handling segment  the company believes that restructuring actions will be a boon and margins will improve In addition  the buyout of DJO Global   to be complete in the first three months of 2019   will diverse Colfax s business structure and mark its entry into the orthopedic solutions industry  It is worth mentioning here that the orthopedic solutions industry currently gains from tailwinds like changing demographics and rising need for preventive healthcare among others  Upon the completion  DJO Global s assets will form a segment within Colfax Factors Working Against ColfaxHigh Costs   Lower Margins  Poor Share Price Performance  Rising costs and expenses have been an issue for Colfax over some time  In the first nine months of 2018  the company s cost of sales increased 11 3  year over year  and its selling  general and administrative expenses expanded 12 5   Colfax s gross margin contracted 49 basis points  bps  year over year and adjusted operating margin fell 90 bps  Escalating costs are mainly due to tariffs and other factors  We believe that  if unchecked  unwarranted increase in costs and expenses will continue to adversely impact margins  and profitability Over the past three months  the company s shares have lost 41 5  compared with the  s decline of 15 7   Risks From Overseas Operations  Colfax has business operations in the United States  Europe  Asia  the Middle East and South America  Though geographical expansion reflects the company s prosperity  it also exposed it to headwinds arising from geopolitical issues and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies In the third quarter of 2018  unfavorable movements in foreign currencies had an adverse 4 2  impact on sales growth Weak Cash Position  Lately Colfax has been using its cash for funding U S  pension expenses and ongoing restructuring initiatives  These usages adversely impacted the company s cash positions   evident from 12 1  year over year decline in cash flow generated from operating activities in the first nine months of 2018 Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the industry are DXP Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ DXPE    EnPro Industries  Inc    NYSE NPO   and Luxfer Holdings PLC   NYSE LXFR    All these stocks currently sport a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  In the past 60 days  earnings estimates for all these three stocks improved for the current year  Further  positive earnings surprise for the last quarter was 17 95  for DXP Enterprises  23 64  for EnPro Industries and 60 61  for Luxfer  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8

2301,223816,DXPE,4 Manufacturing Stocks To Bet On Despite Trade War Jitters ,opinion,After witnessing a sharp rise on Dec 3  the stock markets plunged the next day as President Donald Trump s tweets refueled trade war apprehensions  A flattening yield curve also spooked equity markets  The much awaited dinner meeting between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Dec 1 resulted in a cease fire in the ongoing trade dispute between the world s two largest economies  Both the leaders agreed to a 90 day delay to make time for further negotiations  The United States agreed on refraining from imposing planned increase in tariffs from 10  to 25  on  200 billion which was supposed to come into effect from Jan 1  2019 on Chinese goods exports  Per the truce  China will buy a substantial amount of U S  agricultural  energy and industrial products  The two sides agreed to launch negotiations to reduce trade tensions further and discuss forced technology transfer  intellectual property protection  non tariff barriers  and cyber and agriculture issues  among other concerns over the next 90 days  This development sent the dollar reeling and sparked a rally in global stock markets and commodities  Consequently  the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1 1  or 287 97 points on Dec 3  while the S P 500 added 30 20 points or 1 1   The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1 5  or 110 98 points  Industrial companies like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   Deere  Terex and AGCO also gained as these companies as these were relieved of higher raw material costs due to the imposition of tariffs   Trump s  Tariff Man  Tweets Trigger Fear The euphoria seemed to be short lived  as President Trump s tweets on Dec 4 resulted in market apprehension as to whether the truce will materialize or the relations will still remain vulnerable  Though Trump s  fair deal  echoed optimism  the mention of him being the  Tariff man  and threats of  major tariffs  on Chinese imports if talks fail reignited trade war fears  This triggered concerns whether the two sides will be able to find amicable resolution during the 90 day agreed period  The markets soon reacted to this with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 799 36 points or 3 10   S P 500 index dipped 90 31 points or 3 24  and the Nasdaq Composite losing 283 09 points or 3 80   Industrial stocks like Caterpillar  Deere and Manitowoc  among others dipped 6 93   6 55  and 9 4   respectively on Dec 4  However  all is not over for industrial stocks and it is too early to write off industrial stocks as the recent manufacturing data indicate improved performance in the sector  Upbeat Manufacturing Data Instills Optimism The manufacturing sector which accounts for about 12  of the U S  economy is on a roll this year despite tariff concerns  Per the Institute for Supply Management   ISM   latest report  Purchasing Managers  Index   PMI   for November rose 59 3    exhibiting strong growth in manufacturing for the 27th consecutive month  The upbeat performance continues to be led by strong production output and continued strength in new orders  signaling strong economic momentum  The PMI has averaged 59 2  over the last 12 months ranging from a low of 57 3  in April 2018 to a high of 61 3  in August 2018  Notably  a reading above 50  indicates expansion in manufacturing economy  The PMI reading of 59 3  for November corresponds to an increase of 4 9  in real gross domestic product  GDP  on an annualized basis  New Orders Index registered 62 1  in September  indicating growth in new orders for the 35th consecutive month  Notably  the New Orders Index has remained at 60  or above for the 17th straight month  In spite of labor constraints throughout the supply chain and transportation difficulties  the Production Index registered growth of 60 6  in November  indicating improvement in production for the 27th consecutive month  Employment continued to expand  supporting production growth  The index was pegged at 58 4  in November  indicating growth for the 26th consecutive month  In addition  industrial production   a measure of the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors   rose 0 1  in November for its fifth consecutive monthly increase  The overall index is now reported to have advanced at an annual rate of 4 7  in the third quarter  above the gain of 3 3  reported earlier  Capacity utilization for the industrial sector climbed 78 4  in November  which is 1 4 percentage points lower than its long run  1972 2017  average  These above mentioned strong data numbers is an indication that the sector is on a firm footing  Further  the fact that capacity utilization remains below its long term average indicates that improvement can be expected from the metric  Ongoing momentum in new orders  strong housing and commercial construction markets  growth in job additions  positive consumer confidence  and recent tax reform bodes well for the sector  Moreover  the resolution of the hostilities will act as a major tailwind for manufacturing  which has been one of the biggest casualties of this trade war  Consequently  investing in the industrial space makes perfect sense at this point  We have zeroed in on five industrial stocks which have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a  of A or B  Here V stands for Value  G for

2307,223822,DXPE,Manufacturing Output Rises For Fifth Straight Month  5 Picks ,opinion,In October  manufacturing output increased for the fifth consecutive month  per data from the Federal Reserve  Last month s gains came despite a decline in vehicle production  offsetting the fall in utilities and mining output  This led to the headline industrial production number gaining over October At this point  robust domestic economic expansion is helping to boost the fortunes of the manufacturing sector  However  rising raw materials costs  labor shortfall and capacity constraints are threats to the sector s momentum Fortunately  manufacturers have turned to new strategies such as nearshoring and reshoring to battle such challenges  This is why it still makes sense to bet on select stocks from the sector at this stage Manufacturing Gains Offset Declines in Autos  Utilities  MiningIndustrial production increased by 0 1  in October  primarily because the increase in manufacturing output offset declines across several categories  Manufacturing output increased 0 3  last month  outweighing the decline in mining and utilities  The indexes for these sectors declined 0 3  and 0 5   respectively Additionally  the increase in manufacturing came despite a drastic fall in production of motor vehicles  Production of automobiles declined 2 8  after gaining 1 3  in September  However  manufacturing still increased 0 5  after excluding the impact of motor vehicles and parts  This metric had gained 0 2  in September The primary catalyst for these gains was a solid increase of 0 8  in output of business equipment  Additionally  capacity utilization  which measures to the extent to which companies are utilizing their resources  increased from 76 1 to 76 2 in October  the highest level in more than three years Sector Still Faces Several ChallengesDespite the sector s strong gains in October  manufacturing faces numerous challenges at this point  Labor shortages and capacity constraints make one set of concerns  But what has come to the forefront are the challenges produced by the Trump administration s confrontational stance on trade issues This stance has led to an increase in tariffs on aluminum and steel as well as a variety of tariffs on Chinese goods  Retaliatory duties have also had a detrimental impact  While manufacturers are gaining from tax cuts and have resorted to improving processes and response time  several new strategies have also come into play From Nearshoring to Reshoring The current trend for companies is to opt for nearshoring or even reshoring  Nearshoring takes into account political issues that manufacturing encounters on a regular basis  The idea behind this approach is to locate one s supply chain in Mexico  Canada and other areas in North America  Of course  when an Asian location complies with local content rules and provides a cost advantage  such a move is no longer viable Reshoring goes the whole hog and actually relocates a nearshore or offshore operation back onshore  Contrary to popular view  this has no political advantage  Instead  local tax cuts  strong demand and a better environment make the relocation of a process logical for the same reason that it was nearshored or offshored Our ChoicesThe steady growth in manufacturing output clearly underlines the latent strength in factory activity  This is particularly true for October s increase which has managed to negate the decline in mining and utilities output While  manufacturers continue to face a number of challenges  smarter processes and shorter response times are giving the sector a new edge  Strategies like nearshoring and reshoring are also coming into play  This is why it still makes sense to invest in manufacturing stocks  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a

 Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Wall Street Likely to Sustain Post Midterm Rally  Top PicksFollowing a jolt in October  Wall Street has been in recovery mode since the beginning of November  This recovery gained a boost on Nov 7  as U S  stocks rallied following the declaration of midterm Congressional election results  In fact  investors  optimism has been revived on risky assets like equities with a divided U S  Congress where Republicans have strengthened hold on the Senate while Democrats regained control of the House of Representatives after eight years Wall Street bull run is likely to continue in the rest of 2018 as holiday sales season is approaching  Consequently  it will be prudent to invest in stocks from industries like infrastructure  construction  healthcare and technologies with a favorable Zacks Rank Is Divided Congress Good for Investors Some analysts are also optimistic about Trump s earlier comment that he is willing to co operate with Democrats for some of the core Democratic issues like price control on pharmaceuticals  increased spending on infrastructure projects and middle class tax cut  Democrats are also likely to co operate with Trump administration regarding higher defense spending on 2019 However  much will depend on Trump s attitude as he already warned Democrats of a  warlike situation  if they choose to launch investigations into his administration Investors Welcome Midterm Election ResultsOn Nov 7  all three major stock indexes rallied as the picture of a divided U S  Congress became clear  The Dow jumped 545 29 points or 2 1  to 26 180 30  The S P 500 soared 58 44 points or 2 1  to 2 813 89  Meanwhile  Nasdaq Composite surged 194 79 points or 2 6  to

posted their largest after mid term election gain since 1982 Bull Run Likely to ContinueThe Wall Street bull run is likely to continue buoyed by a strong U S  economy  The U S  GDP s increased 3 3  in the first nine months of 2018  surpassing the target of 3  set by President Trump The U S  consumer confidence index for October was pegged at 137 9  the highest reading since September 2000  The future expectations index   reflecting what Americans think the economy will look like in the next six months   increased to 114 6 from 112 5  signaling strong growth at least up to first quarter of

currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   marking a downward revision from its earlier Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Its market capitalization is approximately  10 3 billion A few growth drivers and certain headwinds  which might influence IDEX  have been discussed below  Factors Favoring IDEX Financial Performance   Bottom Line Outlook  IDEX pulled off a positive average earnings surprise of 5 80  in the last four quarters  This includes impact of 7 63  earnings beat recorded in the third quarter of 2018  Further  in the reported quarter  the company s earnings grew 30 6  year over year on the back of sales growth and diligent execution of productivity initiatives For 2018  IDEX believes that robust sales growth  productivity initiatives and acquired assets will be advantageous  It raised its earnings per share guidance from  5 27  5 35 to  5 35  5 37 In the past 30 days  earnings estimates on the stock for 2018 have been increased by ten brokerage firms and lowered by one  Likewise  estimates for 2019 were increased by seven firms and lowered by one  Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  5 36 for 2018 and  5 77 for 2019  reflecting growth of 0 9  and 0 7  from respective 30 day ago tallies  Further  bottom line estimates represent year over year growth of 24 4  for 2018 and 7 6  for 2019 IDEX Corporation Price and Consensus    Further  the company s earnings in the next three to five years are projected to grow 10 30  Year to date  IDEX s shares have yielded 1 3  return against 8 4  decline recorded by the   Solid Business Opportunities  IDEX gained exposure in various end markets  including industrial  water  energy  food  pharma and many others  through its three segments   Fluid   Metering Technologies  Health   Science Technologies  and Fire   Safety Diversified Products In the third quarter of 2018  organic sales increased 9  and orders grew 7  year over year  For 2018  organic sales are projected to grow by 8  versus 7  predicted earlier  The revised guidance compares favorably with 6  organic growth registered in 2017  For the fourth quarter  organic sales growth is anticipated to be 5 6  Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues on the stock is pegged at approximately  2 5 billion for 2018 and  2 6 billion for 2019  reflecting year over year growth of 8 8  and 4 1   respectively Impressive Capital Allocation Strategy  IDEX effectively uses its cash flow to augment growth opportunities and reward shareholders handsomely  Notably  through acquisitions  IDEX easily penetrated unexplored markets  added products to portfolio and expanded geographical footprints  In the past few quarters  the company has acquired thinXXS Microtechnology AG  December 2017   intellectual property assets of Phantom Controls  June 2018  and Finger Lakes Instrumentation  July 2018  The company rewards its shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks  It used  33 million for paying dividends and  31 million for repurchasing shares in the third quarter of 2018  It s worth mentioning here that the quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 16  in April 2018 Factors Working Against IDEXRising Costs and Expenses  In the first nine months of 2018  IDEX recorded 9 6  increase in the cost of sales and 4  hike in operating expenses  In the last five years  2013 2017   the company s cost of sales increased 1 8   CAGR  and operating expenses grew 1 9   CAGR   We believe that unwarranted rise in costs and expenses will prove detrimental to the company s margins  and profitability For 2018  IDEX predicts that its corporate expenses will be approximately  78  80 million versus  76  80 million mentioned earlier Headwinds From Currency Translation  Geographical diversification is reflective of a flourishing business of IDEX  However  this diversity exposed it to headwinds  arising from geopolitical issues and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  The company anticipates that forex woes will have an adverse 1  impact on sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 Poor Valuation  We believe that IDEX is overvalued relative to the industry as suggested by its Price to Earnings Ratio  P E  metric  P E is a key metric that shows how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  For IDEX  the trailing 12 month P E ratio is pegged at 25 6

2361,223876,DXPE,U S  Manufacturing Sector Remains Strong  5 Top Ranked Picks,opinion,On Apr 2  the Institute for Supply Management  ISM  reported its manufacturing index for the month of March  Despite a decline compared with the previous month  the manufacturing sector as a whole remains robust supported by a healthy domestic economy and strong global markets Also  the U S  economy is currently in good shape  Notably  the demand for U S  products remains robust globally  Moreover  worldwide demand for manufacturing products is on the rise  Taking these factors into consideration  manufacturing stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are lucrative investment options at the moment March Reading Remains RobustThe ISM index for national factory activity was recorded at 59 3 in March compared with 60 8 in February  The reading also came in below the consensus estimate of 60 0  Notably  the February ISM manufacturing reading marked its highest level in 14 years However  a reading of more than 50 indicates that the sector is expanding  Although the reading for new orders  production and employment declined  all the metrics remained near recent highs  In fact  17 out of the total 18 manufacturing industries reported growth in March  This clearly indicates that the U S  heavy industrial sector is forging ahead with a strong momentum Moreover  the seasonally adjusted IHS Markit U S  Manufacturing Purchasing Managers  Index   PMI   recorded a reading of 55 6 in March compared with 55 3 in February  The average PMI reading for the first quarter of 2018 reflects the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2014 Four Driving FactorsThe U S  manufacturing and heavy industrial sector is anticipated to sustain momentum for the rest of 2018  Let s take a brief look at the four factors which will determine growthFirst  Trump administration s decision to cut tax rate from 35  to 21  has been a shot in the arm for the manufacturing sector  The U S  government has also decided to allow U S  companies to repatriate offshore profits at a one time low tax rate Second  the government has taken a decision to spend a whopping  1 5 trillion on several infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years  This decision is likely to create about 25 million new jobs over a decade Third  the U S  unemployment rate is around 4 1   which is a 17 year low  Currently  the U S  labor market is operating at near full employment level  which may result in wage increase spurring higher consumer spending  This in turn will fuel long term economic growth Fourth  spending on capital goods surged in February supported by solid business confidence  improvement in international economic growth and a weakening dollar  A cheap dollar makes U S  manufacturing sector competitive boosting the demand for indigenously produced goods Our Top PicksThe manufacturing sector accounts for nearly 12  of the U S  GDP  In fact  strong manufacturing goods orders are normally associated with stronger economic activity   At present  the U S  economy is firmly placed on growth trajectory barring minor corrections Considering these positives  investing in manufacturing stocks with high growth potential will be a wise decision  We narrowed down our choice to five stocks each of which carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  The chart below

Xylem s public utility sector s business has been gaining strength over time  This improvement is largely attributable to rise in demand for its wastewater and water infrastructure services  especially in the U S  Moreover  the company aims to drive its financials on the back of lucrative business acquisitions 
For instance  the Tideland Signal Corporation buyout in Feb 2016 is reinforcing the company s sales in the coastal and ocean markets  Also  the deal to purchase Sensus  signed in August  is expected to boost Xylem s aggregate earnings from 2017 onward 
Xylem constantly intends to grow its business on the back of increased backlogs  volumes  greater cost discipline and strategic initiatives for operational enhancement  Based on these positives  the company anticipates generating total revenues worth  3 7 billion in full year 2016  with an estimated year over year organic sales growth of 2 3  
Existing Issues
Weak prices of energy resources like oil are currently affecting the revenues generated by manufacturing and industrial companies such as Xylem  Choppy oil prices have been directly hurting the oil companies  sales and  hence  significantly reducing the extent of Greenfield investments made within the sector  As a result  lower investments made by oil companies have depressed the sales generated by producers of heavy equipment  machinery parts and steel Moreover  greater globalization exposes Xylem to several political  environmental  economic and legal headwinds  Even so  each business segment of the company faces stiff competition within the industry  Extensive business rivalry increases the bargaining power of customers  exposing the company to risks of market share loss  The appreciating U S  dollar is enhancing the competitive power of smaller companies operating in low cost nations  thus increasing revenue and margin loss risks for Xylem Stocks to ConsiderXylem currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks within the industry include DXP Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ DXPE    Gorman Rupp Co    NYSE GRC   and Nordson Corp    NASDAQ NDSN    All the three companies currently sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock holds enough credentials to secure investors  confidence but feeble energy market conditions hoists our worry 
Bullish   Bearish Factors to Play  
Increasing demand for wastewater and water infrastructure services is likely to boost Xylem s sales in the quarters ahead  Also  the Tideland Signal Corporation  Feb  2016  and Sensus  inked in Aug  2016  acquisitions are expected to improve the company s top and bottom line in the quarters ahead 
However  uncertain energy market conditions might limit near term growth of the stock  Sales and investments made within the energy sector are currently weakening due to the volatile prices of energy resources  This  in turn  is depressing the revenues generated by industrial product companies of the U S  like Xylem 
Henceforth  Xylem is encircled by both bullish and bearish aspects at present  Over the last 60 days  Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has moved south only by 0 5  for 2016  however  has not changed for 2017 XYLEM INC Price and Consensus

2426,223941,DXPE,5 Russell 2000 Stocks To Buy As Index Surges,opinion,Small cap stocks have been enjoying a great year up to now  The performance of the Russell 2000  the preeminent index of stocks with lower capitalization  is another indication of this trend  The index has outperformed the S P 500  Dow and Nasdaq by a significant margin to date  A lack of choice among other asset classes means that this trend is likely to continue Additionally  the economy remains stronger than others across the world despite the recent trend of disappointing data  Adding domestic small cap stocks from the Russell 2000 makes good sense at this point Economy Remains StableDisappointing ISM manufacturing and services indexes readings have led many to question whether the economy s recovery is faltering  Additionally  the U S  economy created a total of 151 000 jobs in August  considerably lower than the consensus estimate of 179 000 However  comments from a key Fed official on Tuesday belied such worries  San Francisco Fed President John Williams said that the economy is doing well  Additionally  he said that unemployment is likely to fall from the current level of 4 9  to 4 5  next year  Williams also believes that inflation will achieve the Fed s target of 2  within the next two years Market Gains ContinueMeanwhile  markets continue to mop up gains despite disappointing reports  Investors are ignoring any recent economic signals  choosing to focus on the fact that such reports are making a near term rate hike unlikely  Additionally  oil prices continue to move upward  leading to gains for energy sector companies Also  the dollar recorded its steepest daily drop in a month on the possible delay in a Fed rate hike  However  the performance of the dollar has been relatively stable this year  Taken together with the resurgence in oil  this has helped small cap domestic oil stocks Analysts at Fort Pitt Capital Group believe that this has helped the Russell 200 to notch up gains this year  The index is up 10 3  year to date  outperforming the S P 500  which has gained around 7  over the same period Our ChoicesAs investors continue to seek investments delivering high returns in an environment characterized by low interest rates  the popularity of small cap stocks continues to grow  A relatively stable economy and dollar as well as rebound in oil prices have also contributed to this phenomenon Against this backdrop  picking domestic small cap stocks from the Russell 2000 looks like a smart choice  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  We have narrowed down our search to

2427,223942,DXPE,5 Stocks That Brokers Love Right Now ,opinion,In the words of hedge fund manager Seth Klarman   Most investors are oriented toward return  how much they can make and pay little attention to risk  how much they can lose  One of the well accepted winning strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio that would lead to handsome returns at all times  braving market uncertainties  However  with stocks flooding the market  investors might well falter in their attempts to design an optimum portfolio of stocks aimed at generating handsome returns in the absence of proper expert advice  This guidance comes from brokers whose ratings on a stock are backed by well assessed logic Broker Ratings  Winning IndicatorsBrokers indulge in extensive research on the stocks in their coverage  scrutinizing the company s publicly available documents  attending conference calls and often communicating directly with the top management  Naturally  brokers  irrespective of their type  sell side  buy side or independent   are armed with more detailed information on companies compared to individual investors Thus  it is obvious that investors will pay heed to such well researched information to garner maximum returns from their portfolio  If investors notice an upgrade in broker recommendation on a particular stock  they are inclined to believe that there is a strong reason for it  For instance  a company might have raised its earnings guidance based on some positive factors that in turn prompted brokers  optimism on it Estimate Revisions  A Pointer to Price MovementWith brokers expected to impart expert knowledge  equipped with profound understanding of stocks  it is natural that rating actions by these specialists serve as a valuable piece of advice for investors Upward estimate revisions generally lead to a rise in prices  Notably  estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario  Similarly  a stock may fall out of analysts  favor due to adverse events like lackluster earnings performance or pipeline failure  for a biotech player   Trimming of earnings estimates by brokers often leads to stock price depreciation Designing a Winning PortfolioWe have designed a screener to arrive at stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks  However  considering only these factors does not make our strategy foolproof as the top line has not been accounted for Actually  according to many market watchers  a top line beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   To address top line concerns  we have included the price sales ratio in our screener which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric Screening Criteria   Up Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75  This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks   change in Q  1  est   4 weeks    Top  10  This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter Price to Sales   Bot 10

2460,223975,DXPE,Machinery Stocks Q2 Earnings Slated On Aug 8   HY  MTW  DXPE,opinion,The performance of machinery stocks last year was nothing worth writing home about  with adverse currency movements  weakening economic conditions  particularly in China  and multi year low commodity prices haunting the industry  The Machinery industry  which is broadly grouped under the Industrial Products sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors   suffered an unceremonious 22 2  drop in earnings in first quarter 2016 The second quarter 2016 does not paint an impressive picture either  In the sector  95 5  of the companies have reported a 1 2  decline in earnings for the quarter  Considering all the companies that are yet to report  the sector s earnings are expected to fall 4 9  in the quarter Looking at the projected estimates for the quarter  total S P 500 earnings are expected to be down 3 1  on a 0 4  dip in revenues  We are looking at negative earnings projections for the 5th quarter in a row  Growth will be in the red for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with the maximum drag from the Energy sector  read more  Meanwhile  weak industrial production numbers   comprising output of the manufacturing  mining and utility sectors   add to the woes  Per the latest Federal Reserve report  industrial production inched up 0 6  in June  after edging down 0 3  in May  In the second quarter  industrial production suffered its third consecutive quarterly decline  falling at an annual rate of 1   Industrial demand remained challenged in the quarter  hurt by weak global oil   gas markets  Capacity utilization has been decreasing  reflecting slow industrial capex spending While residential and commercial construction continue to be sources of strength  key markets for the machinery industry   such oil and gas  agriculture  and mining   are pulling the industry down  with no possibility of an improvement any time soon  The U S  rig count currently stands at 414  down 47 3  from a year ago and is likely to dwindle even further  in tandem with plunging oil prices  Moreover  the U S  Department of Agriculture estimates farm income to decline further this year  Persistent economic weakness in China has sucked the mining machinery industry into its vortex Keeping these headwinds in mind  it will be interesting to see how some of the machinery stocks fare in their upcoming releases on Aug 8  2016  Apart from beats and misses  focus will also be on steps taken to overcome the headwinds as well as their outlook Hyster Yale Materials Handling  Inc    NYSE HY   designs  engineers  manufactures  sells  and services a line of lift trucks and aftermarket parts in the United States and internationally  The company will report second quarter results before market open on Aug 8  HYSTER YALE MAT Price and EPS Surprise   In the last quarter  Hyster Yale delivered a negative earnings surprise of 10 29   Nevertheless  the stock has a positive average surprise of 5 71  over the trailing 4 quarters The overall global market is predicted to decline modestly in 2016   Market growth in EMEA is expected to be more than offset by declines in the Americas and JAPIC  operations in the Asia and Pacific regions  including China  markets   Despite these market conditions  unit shipments  revenues and parts sales are expected to increase in the remainder of 2016 compared with 2015   However  a strong U S  dollar will continue to affect revenues and results Hyster Yale has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an  of 0 00  which makes surprise prediction difficult The Manitowoc Company  Inc    NYSE MTW     a leading global manufacturer of cranes and lift solutions   will also report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 8  after market close  MANITOWOC INC Price and EPS Surprise   In the prior quarter  Manitowoc posted a negative surprise of 33 33   However  the stock has delivered an average positive surprise of 20 89  in the trailing 4 quarters Manitowoc continues to be hurt by weak demand  particularly in mobile cranes  and low oil prices  Even though the company will benefit from product innovation and launches and cost reduction initiatives  reduced backlog remains a headwind Manitowoc has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which along with a 0 00  ESP  makes an earnings beat unlikely this season DXP Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ DXPE    which engages

Enterprises faced headwinds from lower capital spending by its customers in the oil   gas industry due to choppy oil prices  Also  unfavorable foreign currency movements and its effect on export

2478,223993,DXPE,Machinery Stock Outlook For January 2015,opinion,"As we stand nearly midway through Jan 2015  things look a bit uncertain for the global economy  The year started with major stock indexes across the globe experiencing falls due to dangerously plunging crude oil prices  coupled with decelerating economic activities in Japan and China  Eurozone is not an exception  as political uncertainties cloud its growth prospects 
If this situation persists  the global economy will suffer a setback on its recovery path  Last October  the World Economic Outlook  published by the International Monetary Fund   IMF    highlighted the worsening of operating conditions in some developed and emerging nations  This  consequently  will hurt industrial activities  thus posing a major headwind for the machinery industry  The IMF revised down its global Gross Domestic Product   GDP   forecast by 20 basis points  bps  to 3 8  for 2015  Growth projection for advanced economies was lowered by 10 bps to 2 3   while that for emerging nations was predicted at 5   down 20 bps from the previous estimation  Across nations  the level of industrial activities is measured in terms of industrial production    output of the manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors  A brief discussion on the prospects of the machinery industry in different nations has been provided below 
Prospects in the United States
Let us first take a look at the performance of the U S  toward the end of 2014  As per the latest Federal Reserve report  industrial production increased 5 2  from the year ago month level and 1 3  from the previous month in Nov 2014  The growth was driven by strengthening wood products  machinery  petroleum and coal products  and apparel and leather  food  and plastics and rubber industries  The job market showed signs of recovery  As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  report  252 000 new jobs were added in December  while the unemployment rate fell to 5 6   Also  export demands for the U S  machinery were quite impressive  According to the U S  Census Bureau report published in Jan 2015  machinery shipments increased by 5 8  in the eleven months ended Nov 2014  Shipments for industrial and metalworking machinery rose 37 2  and 6 1   respectively  while the same for farm machinery was down 22 1   New machinery orders were up 6 9   while order backlog grew 9 6   Presently  market sentiments are shaky in the U S  as fluctuating currency movements and damper global growth are likely to hurt the country s export businesses  Falling oil prices add to the woes  Persistent decline in oil price may force oil producing companies to curtail their drilling activities  This may trigger employee lay offs as well as lower capital spending on purchase of machinery and equipments  However  amid all these  the Fed s recent decision to not hike rates in the near term came as a breather  According to the IMF  the U S  economy is projected to grow by 3 1  in 2015 
Japan
 The latest report by Japan s Cabinet Office shows that total machinery orders in Oct 2014 declined 2 9  over the previous month and came way below 8  growth recorded in September  Private sector machinery orders  excluding volatile orders from ships and electric power companies  or core machinery orders were down 6 4   raising concerns over the future of capital investments by companies  Orders from overseas clients fell 4 6   while that from the government clients increased 4 8    Moreover  the country s GDP contracted 0 5  in third quarter 2014  or 1 9  on an annualized basis  versus 0 6  growth recorded in the year ago quarter  Consumption demand was weak due to a 3  increase in sales tax in Apr 2014  The shrinking economy in the quarter compelled the government to delay its second sales tax hike of 2   by 18 months  Also  the Bank of Japan is likely to opt for another reduction in its GDP forecast for fiscal 2014  ending Mar 2015   The IMF predicts the economy to grow by a meager 0 8  in 2015 
Emerging Nations
China  The country s industrial production growth rate slowed down to 7 2  in November versus 7 7  recorded in October and 8  in August  The weakness was due to weaker domestic demands as well as factory shutdowns during the period  Gross Domestic Product growth rate also decelerated to 6 78  in November from 6 91  in October  Exports growth fell to 4 7  while imports shrank 6 7   To boost growth  the central bank of China slashed its interest rates in November apart from easing loan restrictions   The country s economic growth in 2014 is anticipated to lag the government target of 7 5   Also  the overall economic scenario points toward weak growth in 2015 as well  The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow by 7 1  in 2015  India  The country s industrial production in Oct 2014 decreased 4 2  from the year ago month  The decline was due to a 7 6  fall in the manufacturing rate  more than offsetting the respective growth rates of 5 2  and 13 3  recorded in mining and electricity sectors  GDP growth in the September ending quarter slowed down to 5 3  as compared with 5 7  recorded in the June ending quarter  However  expectations of strong demand  policy improvements and better monsoon conditions will act as the primary growth drivers for the country  going forward  The newly formed government has already taken certain measures to successfully boost the country s foreign capital inflow  According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow by 6 4  in 2015 Brazil  The country s industrial production in Nov 2014 declined 5 8  from the year ago quarter  The fall was worse than the 3 6  decline in October  Also  the country recorded negligible GDP growth of 0 1  for third quarter 2014  For 2015  the country projects a gloomy outlook as a result of low private investments  inadequate infrastructure and high labor costs  The IMF has lowered its growth forecast on the country by 60 bps to 1 4   However  the country s efforts to attract more foreign direct investments and expand industries like tourism  steel and electricity  might provide some strength  rekindling the hopes for growth  Also  the Brazilian government s growth acceleration program will garner capital investments for the development of ports  railroads  airports  wind farms and roads 
Eurozone
 The eurozone s industrial production  excluding construction  in Oct  2014 managed a 0 1  rise over the previous month while increasing 0 7  year over year  as per Eurostat s data released in Dec 2014  According to the VDMA Machine Makers  Association  German machine tool orders in the Oct  Dec  period fell 3   Domestic orders were down 4   while international orders declined 2   The IMF projects the euro area to grow by 1 3  in 2015  The estimate has been revised down by 20 bps from its previous projection  The outlook is quite gloomy  owing to the steep fall of the region s currency Euro  as a result of the plunging oil prices as well as domestic issues  In Sep  2014  the European Central Bank  ECB  stunned the global market by announcing fresh cuts in all interest rates and negative rates on bank deposits  In addition  a stimulus plan  infusing money in the market through purchase of covered bank bonds and asset backed securities  was also announced  These initiatives are aimed at combating the ill effects of low inflation in the region
