99861,321376,AVGO,CalTech wins  1 1 billion jury verdict in patent case against Apple  Broadcom,news,"By Jan Wolfe and Stephen Nellis WASHINGTON SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The California Institute of Technology said on Wednesday that it won a  1 1 billion jury verdict in a patent case against Apple  O AAPL  and Broadcom  O AVGO   In a case filed in federal court in Los Angeles in 2016  the Pasadena  California based research university alleged that Broadcom wi fi chips used in hundreds of millions of Apple iPhones infringed patents relating to data transmission technology   While we thank the members of the jury for their service  we disagree with the factual and legal bases for the verdict and intend to appeal   Broadcom said in a statement  Apple said it plans to appeal the verdict  but declined further comment  The company had said in court filings that it believed all of the university s claims against it resulted from its using Broadcom s chips in its devices  calling itself  merely an indirect downstream party   Broadcom is a major Apple supplier  deriving about a fifth of its sales from the iPhone maker in its fiscal 2019  Last week Broadcom said it had signed deals to sell as much as  15 billion worth of chips to Apple  The verdict awarded CalTech  837 8 million from Apple and  270 2 million from Broadcom  
 We are pleased the jury found that Apple and Broadcom infringed Caltech patents   CalTech said in a statement   As a non profit institution of higher education  Caltech is committed to protecting its intellectual property in furtherance of its mission to expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education  ",2020-01-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/caltech-wins-11-billion-jury-verdict-in-patent-case-against-apple-broadcom-source-2071177,2071177
99862,321377,AVGO,Better Buy  Skyworks Solutions vs  Broadcom,news,"Skyworks Solutions  NASDAQ SWKS  and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  both produce chips for an increasingly connected world  Skyworks sells radio frequency  RF  chips for the mobile  automotive  broadband  wireless infrastructure  home automation  industrial  and military markets 
Broadcom sells myriad semiconductors for the data center  networking  storage solutions  broadband  wireless  and industrial markets  It also expanded its infrastructure software business by acquiring CA Technologies in 2018 and Symantec s enterprise security business in 2019 
Both companies rely heavily on Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   which accounted for 51  and 20  of Skyworks  and Broadcom s revenue  respectively  in fiscal 2019  Skyworks supplies power amplifier modules  PAM  and diversity receive front end  DRx  modules for iPhones and iPads  while Broadcom supplies Wi Fi  Bluetooth  and RF front end chips for the iPhone  iPad  and Apple Watch 

Skyworks  stock rallied nearly 30  over the past three years  while shares of Broadcom rose more than 50   Let s look back at why Broadcom outperformed Skyworks  and whether or not that trend will continue in 2020 
Which company is growing faster 
Skyworks reports its revenue by region instead of product category  Last year  55  of its revenue came from the United States  21  came from China  11  came from South Korea  8  came from Taiwan  and the rest came from other countries 
Skyworks  revenue fell 13  to  3 38 billion in 2019  mainly due to slower smartphone sales and the government mandated suspension of shipments to Chinese tech giant Huawei  Its earnings  buoyed by buybacks  only dipped 2  
Broadcom  which was formerly known as Avago before its takeover of Broadcom in 2016  reports it revenue by both product category and region  It generated 77  of its revenue from semiconductor solutions and 23  from infrastructure software solutions last year  67  of its sales came from the Asia Pacific region  followed by 23  from the Americas and 10  from other markets 
Broadcom s revenue rose 8  to  22 6 billion in 2019  fueled by higher demand for its data center chips and the growth of infrastructure software business  However  its acquisitions of CA and Symantec s enterprise security unit reduced its earnings by 78  
2019 was an unusual year for both Skyworks and Broadcom  but both chipmakers should generate more stable growth in fiscal 2020  Based on Wall Street s consensus estimates  Broadcom looks cheaper relative to its projected growth 

Source  Yahoo Finance  Jan  28 
Furthermore  Broadcom s forward dividend yield of 4  is significantly higher than Skyworks  1 4  yield  Broadcom hiked its dividend annually for ten straight years  while Skyworks did the same for five straight years 
The tailwinds and headwinds
Apple s launch of 5G iPhones in late 2020 will be a major boon for both chipmakers  Broadcom also recently signed a new deal with Apple to provide  15 billion in wireless components over the next three years  so it won t lose its top customer anytime soon 

Both companies should also benefit from the deescalation of trade tensions between the U S  and China that followed the  phase one  trade deal in January  Skyworks could start shipping more chips to Huawei and other Chinese OEMs again 
Broadcom    which lost its bid for Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  due to  national security  concerns regarding its deals with Chinese companies    might be allowed to buy American chipmakers again  since it redomiciled from Singapore to Delaware in 2018 to avoid further scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  
The ramp up of 5G networks should also boost demand for Skyworks  and Broadcom s chips across multiple industries  including data center operators and communications infrastructure providers 
Yet several unpredictable headwinds remain on the horizon  The Chinese economy is growing at its slowest rate in three decades  and the coronavirus crisis could throttle spending in the enterprise and consumer electronics markets  The trade war between the U S  and China remains unresolved  and the outcome of the U S  presidential election remains a wild card for global trade 
The winner  Broadcom
Skyworks and Broadcom face similar issues  but Broadcom is clearly the better all around investment  It isn t as dependent on Apple  has a better diversified portfolio of chips and software  pays a higher dividend  and trades at a lower valuation ",2020-02-01,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppt36,2073728

To start  stick with the essentials of long term growth investing  Build a diversified portfolio of stocks with exposure to various styles  sizes  sectors  and regions

99864,321379,AVGO,How Trading Your Own Retirement Can Fleece Your Financial Future   January 30  2020,opinion,"You have a substantial retirement portfolio  You re an accomplished investor  You ve done truly well selecting stocks  You probably already own a couple of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO   OceanFirst Financial  OCFC  and Brookline Bancorp  BRKL  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
It could be a good idea   that is  if you are one of the very few investors who understands your own risk tolerance and can keep your emotions in check during chaotic market swings  However  if you re like the rest of us  there are likely more prudent ways to reach your retirement investing goals 
That s because the risk   reward scenario and investing approach is completely different for long term wealth building and active stock trading 
Managing Retirement Investments  Stock Picking vs  Diversification
While stock picking can potentially generate outsized returns  its excessive concentrated risk can present huge perils for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets spanning nine decades revealed that only 4  of the best performing U S stocks produced all the market s increases  The rest were flat   the gains of the following 38  were offset by the losses of the bottom 58  
Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is it Possible to Invest  Rationally  
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
The Key Takeaway for Retirement Investors
When it comes to managing your assets for retirement  you must look at performance over the course of years and decades   not weeks or months  Because most traders generally tend to focus on the short term  they may not have the right mindset to achieve successful long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should give up trading  Not necessarily  One solution is to take 10  of your investable assets and trade to generate alpha and seek outsized returns 
However  the major part of your wealth   those assets reserved for retirement   ought to be invested utilizing a more careful  conservative  risk management strategy to produce steady  compounded returns so you can securely achieve your retirement objectives

Active stock trading requires a very different investing approach and risk   reward mindset than investing for retirement 
How Diversification Differs from Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially generate outsized returns  its excessive concentrated risk can present huge perils for retirement investors

For even the most expert stock pickers  the chances for long term achievement are thin 
Is Investing Success All In Your Mind 
Most people think they can make rational investment decisions  but research indicates the opposite is often true  Investors followed in a DALBAR study performed significantly worse than the S P 500  For the 30 years between 1986 to 2015  the average investor earned just 3 66   whereas the S P 500 produced a 10 35  return 
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
The Bottom Line for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio ought to be dealt with a technique of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self coordinated investors will in general miss the mark with regards to long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should give up trading  Not necessarily  One solution is to take 10  of your investable assets and trade to generate alpha and seek outsized returns 
But the point we re making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative  long term approach designed to produce reliable returns  so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals

1  Radio silence from Beijing
China kept an awkward silence as it digested the reported offer by the U S  to roll back some tariffs and cancel those due to come into force at the weekend  in return for guaranteed annual purchases of U S  farm goods 
 Chinese authorities and official media so far haven t given any information on China and the U S  are close to a deal   Hu Xijin  editor of the English language Chinese publication Global Times  said via Twitter   As the U S  side released optimistic information through various channels  the Chinese side has basically kept silent  This is a delicate situation  
Analysts argue that the offer by the White House may be perceived as a trap  saying that Beijing will resist being drawn into an agreement where its compliance can be easily and reliably measured 
2  U K  assets surge on Conservative triumph
U K  assets surged after an emphatic victory for Boris Johnson s Conservatives lifted the political uncertainty over Brexit and banished the threat of a radical left wing government 
The pound consolidated against the dollar and euro after its biggest one day gain in over two years  U K  stocks also rose sharply  with homebuilders  banks  utilities and consumer stocks all figuring prominently 
Yields on U K  government bonds hit their highest since the spring as risk appetite returned and the prospect of a big boost to public spending next year militated against any further interest rate cuts by the Bank of England 
3   Stocks set to open higher  retail sales data eyed
U S  stocks are set to open higher on Friday  on a combination of trade hopes  greater clarity over Brexit in the wake of the U K  election   and the commitment of the Federal Reserve to flood the market with liquidity over the year end to ensure that last year s bout of volatility isn t repeated

4  House committee to vote on articles of impeachment
The House Judiciary Committee will likely vote on two articles of impeachment  seeking to remove President Donald Trump for abuse of office and for obstructing the work of Congress 
The vote is shaping up to proceed on partisan lines  with GOP representatives still refusing to accept allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine  a U S  ally  into investigating the son of Joe Biden in order to help his own re election campaign  Trump allegedly withheld military aid approved by Congress for Ukraine  hoping to extract an announcement from President Volodymyr Zelensky that Hunter Biden was being investigated for corruption 
If the vote passes the full House  Trump will be tried in the GOP controlled Senate

99932,321447,AVGO,How Trading Your Own Retirement Can Fleece Your Financial Future   January 06  2020,opinion,"Maybe you re a seasoned investor and have a good track record with stock picking  And you may have a robust retirement portfolio   perhaps including some Zacks Top Retirement stock selections such as 
AbbVie  ABBV   NexPoint Residential Trust Inc   NXRT  and Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
Maybe   if you re an exceptional investor who can expertly manage risk and keep up perfectly resolute emotional control in the face of market volatility  Be that as it may  for most investors  there might be better ways to accomplish long term retirement investing objectives 
That s because the risk   reward scenario and investing approach is completely different for long term wealth building and active stock trading 
How Diversification Differs from Stock Picking
Picking individual stocks has the potential for huge returns   but also carries a lot of risk  which is particularly hazardous when investing for retirement 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets over nine decades found that just 4  of the best performing U S stocks generated all the market s gains  The rest were flat   the gains of the next 38  were wiped out by the bottom 58   which lost money 
For even the most talented stock pickers  the odds for long term success are slim 
Is Investing Success All In Your Mind 
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
The Bottom Line for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio ought to be dealt with a technique of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self coordinated investors will in general miss the mark with regards to long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns 
However  the major part of your wealth   those assets reserved for retirement   ought to be invested utilizing a more careful  conservative  risk management strategy to produce steady  compounded returns so you can securely achieve your retirement objectives

99933,321448,AVGO,Powerful Proof Anyone Can Invest For An Early Retirement   January 08  2020,opinion,"Accomplishing the financial cushion to retire early is a fantasy for most  Bringing the fantasy to reality is not as difficult as it sounds  The key is straightforward  Save significantly more every month  Sounds simple  correct  One moment 
Typically  advisors peg 15  to 20  of total income saved each month as a goal   but if you want to retire earlier  you probably have to ratchet that number up to 40  or 50  of your income  Not a feat easily accomplished when you review your take into account that a good portion of your paycheck goes to essential  non negotiable lifestyle items  However  if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle changes and sacrifices  it s possible 
A generally new development called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been created around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  idea  FIRE supporters create exacting savings plans  up to 75  of income  and make related compromises like living in small homes  walking to work every day  prohibitive weight control plans  etc  This way might be unreasonably prohibitive for many  yet the mentality offers a few takeaways that may merit consideration 
First  stick with the fundamentals of long term growth investing  Choose a diversified portfolio of stocks with exposure to different styles  sizes  sectors  and regions 
To speed up the retirement investment cycle  you can build a portfolio structured with more risk   and the potential for higher returns  It should in any case be adequately diversified to safeguard against sharper than normal market downturns that can be hard to recuperate from and that can ruin any opportunity to achieve your early retirement goal  There are various strategies to diversify a portfolio  and how you do so should be guided by your age  your risk appetite  your growth and income needs  and your long term objectives 
Once you have accelerated your savings and put an ongoing plan in place  invest your savings into your portfolio as soon as possible  Don t try to time the market  Leave your portfolio alone  and let the compounding nature of the markets do its magic to help grow your retirement nest egg exponentially over time 
Growth stocks with low beta  strong earnings estimates  positive sales growth  and expected future growth are an excellent way to determine investable growth stocks for your retirement 
The Zacks Rank routinely recognizes lower risk growth retirement portfolio picks  and here are a few that may be worth considering  Brinker International  EAT   Pembina Pipeline  PBA  and Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO   These growth stocks have strong Zacks Ranks and a beta of 1 or lower  with earnings and sales growth of at least 5  over the past 5 years

99968,321483,AVGO,Buyout firm Thoma Bravo adds Sophos to its cybersecurity chest with  3 8 billion deal,news,"By Yadarisa Shabong
 Reuters    U S  private equity firm Thoma Bravo is adding Sophos Group  L SOPH  to its cybersecurity stable  announcing on Monday a buyout deal that values the British maker of antivirus and encryption products at about  3 8 billion 
The takeover price of 583 pence per share represented a 37  premium from Sophos s closing price on Friday and Sophos shares surged nearly 38  on news of the deal 
Sophos  whose customers include  Under Armour  Inc  N UAA    Ford Motor Co   N F  and Toshiba Corp  T 6502   listed in 2015 at 225 pence per share and has seen its market value double since then  despite a tough 2018 
Thoma Bravo s move for Sophos trails several other buyout deals by U S  funds drawn toward the UK as the pound weakened ahead of Brexit 
Sophos Group shareholders will get  7 40 per share in cash  which is 583 pence per share 
Shares of rival Avast  L AVST  also rose after the Sophos deal was announced 
Sophos CEO Kris Hagerman told Reuters that his company had first been approached by Thoma Bravo in June 
 The  Sophos  board ultimately concluded that this offer and the acquisition can accelerate Sophos  progress in next generation cybersecurity   Hagerman said 
CYBERSECURITY MARKET EVOLVING
Private equity funds are increasingly targeting listed companies in Britain  Advent recently offered to buy engineering firm  Cobham   L COB  while an investment consortium led by Blackstone  NYSE BX  looks to take control of Madame Tussaud s owner Merlin  L MERL  
Thoma Bravo  which raised billions for its latest private equity fund this year  had been targeting the cyber security sector  Late last year  it bought Imperva and another cyber security firm called Veracode from Broadcom Inc  O AVGO  
In 2017  it purchased Sophos  close competitor Barracuda Networks  which manages data security over the cloud 
 The global cybersecurity market is evolving rapidly  driven by significant technological innovation  as cyber threats to business increase in scope and complexity   Seth Boro  managing partner  at Thoma Bravo said in a statement on Monday 
Analyst Neil Campling of Mirabaud Securities said Sophos could be  valuably merged with Barracuda to focus on the SMB  small and medium businesses  opportunities  
Sophos s Hagerman said there was a transition to next generation security products such as machine learning and APIs  with the cloud at the heart of that transition for products to actively communicate with each other and manage threat responses 
Hagerman noted that Sophos  growth in recent years has fundamentally been due to its security solutions that can be deployed to any size organization 
Analysts at  Hargreaves  Lansdown  LON HRGV  cautioned investors about Thoma Bravo s dollar denominated deal for Sophos  saying  but should a Brexit deal be agreed  a rally in sterling could leave investors out of pocket

Within the past 24 hours  a Brexit deal has seemed exasperatingly within touching distance  only for a series of conflicting messages  denials and clarifications to muddy the waters  But with hours to go before a critical summit of European leaders  the signs point to an  unstoppable political will to finally put an end to a divorce saga that has dragged on for years  The big question is  of course  whether any potential deal will secure the backing of an unruly British Parliament and what the implications would be if it doesn t   
What s Happening
Turkish Trouble   Another hot potato on EU leaders  plate during their two day meeting is Turkey s  incursion into Syria   a move that prompted the bloc s foreign ministers to  curb arms exports to the country  and Donald Trump  to write this legendary letter  That and Turkey s controversial energy exploration off Cyprus have exacerbated tensions already heightened by the Turkish President s crackdown on domestic political opponents  
Money Talks   Discussions on the EU s  seven year budget were always going to be tricky as Britain s  probably  imminent departure from the bloc leaves a hole that must somehow be plugged  During their summit  leaders will discuss the  volume  and the conditions attached to the disbursement of the trillion euro funds  but with the latest compromise proposal being shot down by EU countries earlier this week  the aim of coming up with figures by December appears ambitious   
Ursula s Plans   This could get slightly awkward  Leaders will hear about the European Commission s priorities for the next five years from President elect Ursula von der Leyen  Problem is  her team  won t start on time after a debacle involving France s pick  which dealt an embarrassing blow to Emmanuel Macron 
Italy s Budget   Italy s government is counting on  the goodwill of EU partners to start delivering on promises to voters  but the coalition already is paring down its ambitions  It has made promises that will widen the country s structural deficit slightly in 2020  That will require flexibility from the Commission  which must sign off on the plan 
In Case You Missed It
Spanish Turmoil   Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is  under pressure to restore order in Catalonia after a  night of violence in cities across the region in the wake of jail sentences handed down to separatist leaders  This is all playing out against the backdrop of a campaign ahead of an election in November  raising the stakes for the Spanish premier as he comes under fire from political rivals to respond 
Major Shift   The German political class is preparing itself to deliver bold fiscal stimulus if the economy needs it  With Europe s largest economy potentially facing a major hit if the Brexit negotiations unravel or the conflict in Syria spirals out of control   here s what is focusing minds in Berlin and why  Meanwhile  Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said stepping up spending is  completely disconnected  from reality 
Chip Control   EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager ordered Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  to drop allegedly  unfair clauses that may compel set top box makers to use its chips  deploying a rarely used weapon meant to prevent victims from suffering while probes drag on for years  The move follows criticism that probes into Google and Intel took so long that by the time fines were levied  victims were thwarted  
Dirty Money   After finding itself at the epicenter of a money laundering scandal   involving transfers from Russia to the West   Estonia is staking a claim on the fines imposed on the nation s banks as a result  Its finance minister thinks this could actually raise a lot  he took to Facebook  NASDAQ FB  to say this could bring in hundreds of millions and  possibly about billions

99974,321489,AVGO,Easy Investing Secrets To An Early Retirement   December 31  2019,opinion,"Achieving the financial freedom to retire early a dream for most  Making that dream a reality isn t as tricky as it sounds  The secret is simple  Save a lot more each month  Sounds easy  right  Not so fast 
Usually  advisors advise 15  to 20  of total income saved every month as an objective   yet in the event that you want to retire earlier  you likely need to tighten that number up to 40  or half of your pay  Not a discipline easily practiced when you review or consider that a substantial segment of your paycheck goes to basic  non  negotiable lifestyle needs  But if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle adjustments and trade offs  it s achievable 
A relatively new movement called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been developed around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  concept  FIRE followers develop strict savings programs  up to 75  of income  and make associated sacrifices like living in small apartments  walking to work every day  restrictive diets  and so on  This path may be too restrictive for many  but the mindset offers some takeaways that might be worth considering 
First  stick with the fundamentals of long term growth investing  Choose a diversified portfolio of stocks with exposure to different styles  sizes  sectors  and regions 
To speed up the retirement investment cycle  you can build a portfolio structured with more risk   and the potential for higher returns  It should in any case be adequately diversified to safeguard against sharper than normal market downturns that can be hard to recuperate from and that can ruin any opportunity to achieve your early retirement goal  There are various strategies to diversify a portfolio  and how you do so should be guided by your age  your risk appetite  your growth and income needs  and your long term objectives 
Once you ve begun saving at a higher rate and you have an investment plan  put that money to work in your plan as quickly as you can  Don t worry about finding the  perfect time  to invest   simply put the money in and keep it in  Let compounding work to help you grow your retirement savings at an exponential rate 
Growth stocks with low beta  strong earnings estimates  positive sales growth  and expected future growth are an excellent way to determine investable growth stocks for your retirement 
The Zacks Rank routinely recognizes lower risk growth retirement portfolio picks  and here are a few that may be worth considering  Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO   EPR Properties  EPR  and Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   These growth stocks have strong Zacks Ranks and a beta of 1 or lower  with earnings and sales growth of at least 5  over the past 5 years

 Reuters    U S  stock indexes were set to open flat on Wednesday as a move to launch an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump unnerved investors  but a jump in shares of  Nike  and tobacco companies helped dispel some gloom 
The news on probe  which pushed the S P 500  SPX  to post its biggest percentage drop in a month on Tuesday  worsened an already fragile sentiment after Trump took a harsh tone about China s trade practices  saying he would not accept a  bad deal  
 At the end  we closed off the day s lows  which tells me that there isn t any panic in the market that would cause an accelerated decline   said Peter Cardillo  chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York

1  Whistleblower s attorneys have new client  or clients 
Attorneys representing the CIA official whose report led to impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump now say they are working on behalf of  multiple  whistleblowers with first hand knowledge of Trump s efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Hunter Biden  the son of former vice president Joe 
The prospect of corroboration of the initial claims by other staff will intensify the scrutiny on the administration  even though Trump has publicly admitted that he wants Ukraine and China to investigate the Biden family ahead of next year s elections   something that appears at face value to be a direct call for foreign powers to help him in next year s election campaign 
2  Report hits trade hopes 
The chance of a major breakthrough between China and the U S  in their trade dispute has reportedly ebbed 
Trade talks between the two countries  top negotiators are due to resume on Thursday  but Bloomberg reported that China has dug its heels in and no longer wants to make concessions regarding its industrial policy  an area that covers the extensive subsidies enjoyed by Chinese businesses 
It s not clear how serious Beijing ever was about making such concessions  but the report suggested that Beijing will drive a harder bargain  seeing that Trump s own need for a deal is becoming more urgent in view of the economic slowdown and the impeachment proceedings  The offshore yuan rate fell slightly against the dollar 
3  Stocks set to give up Friday gains
U S  stock markets are set to open the week lower after rallying into the close on Friday on the hope for an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve later this month 
Trade pessimism and forebodings about the upcoming earnings season are weighing on expectations  Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect S P 500 companies to report an average 4  year on year decline in earnings in the third quarter  according to The Wall Street Journal

4  GM strike drags on

Terry Dittes  the U A W  s lead negotiator with GM  was quoted as telling members that the union  could not be more disappointed with General Motors  NYSE GM    adding that   These negotiations have taken a turn for the worse  
GM stock has fallen over 10  since the strike began  sharply underperforming the Dow Jones Autos index 
5  Europe struggles with Brexit  German slowdown
Europe s markets continued to struggle after another disappointing set of factory orders from Germany  Orders fell 0 6  on the month in August  keeping the region s largest economy on track to enter recession in the third quarter 
While the headline number was worse than expected  it was offset by an upward revision to July s figures  which fell only 2 1   rather than the 2 7  initially reported 
Also weighing on sentiment is the ever more real prospect of a disorderly Brexit  Reports over the weekend suggested that there is little chance of the EU and U K  bridging their differences on a revised withdrawal agreement by the summit due next week   Prime Minister Boris Johnson is required by law to ask for an extension to the Oct  31 deadline if there is no deal by then

Talks between the two sides  top trade negotiators are due to resume on Thursday  but Bloomberg cast doubt on any major progress  saying that the Chinese position had hardened and that it is no longer minded to make concessions on key issues such as subsidies to state owned enterprises  It s unclear however  how serious Beijing had ever been about making such concessions  
By 7 10 AM ET  1110 GMT   Dow futures were down 44 points  or 0 2   while S P 500 Futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down in parallel 
Tech stocks in general  and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  in particular  were set to face fresh pressure after a report that the EU s antitrust authorities are set to step up their clampdown on what they see as abuse of market power by U S  tech giants  
The Financial Times reported that the EU is set to issue  interim  measures forcing Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  to suspend sales practises it suspects of being anti competitive  even before the European Commission s investigation into the issue has run its course  In Broadcom s case  this refers to contractual requirements which stop Broadcom s customers from buying chips elsewhere 
Elsewhere  GM stock is also likely to be in focus after battle lines hardened in the company s strike  which is now entering a fourth week  United Auto Workers representatives said negotiations between the two sides had  taken a turn for the worse   with GM refusing to make assurances of job security for its U S  workforce as it divvies up future production between the U S  and Mexico

100012,321527,AVGO,The Extreme Risks Of Trading Your Own Retirement Assets   December 19  2019,opinion,"You have a substantial retirement portfolio  You re an accomplished investor  You ve done truly well selecting stocks  You probably already own a couple of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
Armada Hoffler Properties  AHH   Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO  and Banner  BANR  
If you did something similar  would it be advisable for you to trade your own retirement nest egg 
Perhaps   if you re the  one in a million  investor who can expertly manage risk and maintain unflinching emotional control in volatile markets  But for most  there may be better strategies to achieve long term retirement investing goals 
That s because the risk   reward scenario and investing approach is completely different for long term wealth building and active stock trading 
Diversification vs  Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially generate outsized returns  its excessive concentrated risk can present huge perils for retirement investors 
In fact  a study done by Hendrik Bessembinder revealed that only 4  of equities produced all of the stock market s gains over the last 90 years  All other stocks  broke even  with the increases of 38  canceled out by the losses of the bottom 58  
Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is Investing Success All In Your Mind 
Most people think they can make rational investment decisions  but research indicates the opposite is often true  Investors followed in a DALBAR study performed significantly worse than the S P 500  For the 30 years between 1986 to 2015  the average investor earned just 3 66   whereas the S P 500 produced a 10 35  return 
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio ought to be dealt with a technique of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self coordinated investors will in general miss the mark with regards to long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should give up trading  Not necessarily  One solution is to take 10  of your investable assets and trade to generate alpha and seek outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals

100047,321562,AVGO,Broadcom Inc   AVGO  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,"Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO  came out with quarterly earnings of  5 39 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 36 per share  This compares to earnings of  5 85 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0 56   A quarter ago  it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of  5 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 16  delivering a surprise of 0 98  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Broadcom Inc Which belongs to the Zacks Electronics   Semiconductors industry  posted revenues of  5 78 billion for the quarter ended October 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 38   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 44 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Broadcom Inc  Shares have added about 25 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 25 3  
What s Next for Broadcom Inc 
While Broadcom Inc  Has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Broadcom Inc  Was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  5 48 on  5 74 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  23 27 on  24 05 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Electronics   Semiconductors is currently in the top 14  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-12-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/broadcom-inc-avgo-q4-earnings-and-revenues-beat-estimates-200492307,200492307

100049,321564,AVGO,3 Safe Dividends   Up To 15    For A Toppy Stock Market,opinion,"The way to protect your portfolio isn t large caps it s large yields  And the very best ones often come in small packages  such as the three  underappreciated dividends  yielding up to 15  that I m about to show you 
I m talking about funds that pay big  secure dividends  When pullbacks happen  these funds  prices don t move thanks to their yields  After all  a 15  annual payout  like the one we re going to discuss shortly  buffers your portfolio against plenty of market volatility 
Here s an example  Let s consider Wall Street s temper tantrum from late 2015 to early 2016  which greeted our launch of the  service focused on dividends that are big enough to retire on 
During this stock market correction the S P 500 lost more than 10  in six months  And the Dividend Aristocrats  blue chip stock that have raised their payouts every year for the last 25  provided far less protection than you might have expected 
Not Much Pullback Help Here 






But while tried and true Aristocrats such as W W  Grainger  GWW  and Stanley Black   Decker  SWK  were submerged  our more generous dividends had their heads above water  Indeed  if our subscribers had simply paid attention to their portfolio returns and somehow skipped the daily news  they might have missed the market s fit altogether 
  But Our Big Dividend Payers Barely Blinked  






Check out the green  pink and blue lines above  These rarely covered bond holdings not only kept churning out their 7  annual dividends but generated 5  plus returns in six months while stocks were busy correcting 
I ve never seen a single one of these funds touted on CNBC or Fox Business  but these sneaky super yielders have delivered 10 6  annual gains to subscribers since inception  most of which has been in the form of cold  hard cash 
Let s dive into a trio of massive yields that come in small  hidden packages  These relatively secretive income picks dish out between 9 3  to 15 0  annually like clockwork  making them powerful  potentially pullback proof plays 
AllianzGI Convertible   Income Fund II  NCZ 
Dividend Yield  10 8 
AllianzGI Convertible   Income Fund II  NCZ  is a fixed income fund that aims to invest at least half its portfolio in domestic convertible securities  with the rest in good  old fashioned high yield bonds 
How much ultimately goes into convertibles typically corporate bonds or preferred stocks that can be converted into common stock depends on various market factors  That decision falls upon an experienced management team  with every member on board for at least a decade 
The portfolio currently is split 60 40 between convertibles and high yield bonds  At the moment  top holdings include the likes of a 7 5  preferred series from  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   a 6  preferred from  Sempra Energy   NYSE SRE  and an 8  preferred from chipmaker Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  
Clearly  AllianzGI Convertible   Income Fund II s portfolio has a high yield base as it is  But as a closed end fund  CEF   NCZ s management can crank up its distribution into the 11  realm by applying a hefty 30  in leverage to boot 
That hasn t helped in recent years  unfortunately  While the fund s longer term performance is admirable  the past five years or so have been less than stellar  with NCZ struggling to keep up with basic ETF bond and preferred stock benchmarks 
AllianzGI Convertible   Income II Looks Clunky Lately






The CEF does trade at a thin  but rare  discount to its net asset value  NAV  at the moment  But I want to see if NCZ s management can right the ship again first 
Let s move on 
Templeton Dragon Fund  TDF 
Dividend Yield  15 0 
The Templeton Dragon Fund  TDF   as the name alludes to  is a rare China focused fund in the CEF space  Most of the portfolio  83   is invested in mainland Chinese stocks  with another 8  in Hong Kong equities and the rest in companies HQ d in Taiwan 
A quick look at the innards reveals a pretty standard Chinese portfolio  albeit a concentrated one  E commerce giant  Alibaba  Group  NYSE BABA   tech conglomerate Tencent Holdings  TCEHY  and chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor  TSM  alone make up a quarter of TDF s weight  That said  financials  such as AIA Group  AAGIY   make up the largest part of the fund at 25  of assets 






There s nothing novel here  Just strong management  Yes    but TDF has done it better than most  Not only does it beat most China focused ETFs handily  but at 1 33  in annual expenses  it s decidedly on the inexpensive side for a CEF  It trades at a steep 12  discount to NAV  though that s a pretty typical discount for Templeton Dragon 






The only fault to find with TDF and it s not a small one is that the sky high distribution is extremely uneven  with no real pattern to when it pays  In other words  while it s a fantastic fund  this isn t the kind of holding that will keep you in dependable income on a regular schedule 
This is too erratic for a retirement portfolio 
 Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Multi Sector Income Fund  ERC 
Dividend Yield  9 3 
The  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Multi Sector Income Fund  ERC  is a bit misleading  That is  you re not going to be invested in  say  utilities  tech stocks and health care companies  The multi sector moniker refers to the three fixed income  sleeves  it invests in  30  70  high yield corporate debt  10  40  foreign debt and 10  30  adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities  MBSes  and investment grade corporates 
Right now  more than half the fund is in corporates  with most of that allocated to junk  The rest is dispersed across foreign government bonds  17    loans  14     Yankee  corporates and notes  6   and a peppering of other debt 
This fund is a strong fixed income candidate  It s never going to beat the market when it s in full bull mode  but it s able to crush most standard fixed income benchmarks 






And  unlike TDF  it s much more a model of what you want from a retirement fund  monthly distributions  and uber high yield to boot 
Just exercise patience  ERC has averaged a nearly 10  discount to NAV over the past five years  and has traded as cheaply as 83 cents on the dollar within the past year  But it s relatively expensive now  at just a 4  discount 
I would wait for a wider discount window before considering this fund 
Never Fear a Pullback Again   2008 Proof  Stocks With 7 5   Yields  10   Upside
This is no time for  but  funds 
You know   It s a great fund  but   
We re in the back half of a bull market that s too long in the tooth for comfort  and global risks are piling onto still climbing but still fragile stocks 
So even mammoth yields like the ones above aren t really worth all that much if they don t provide every last thing you need to protect  and grow  your hard earned nest egg  rain or shine 
That s precisely the inspiration behind   which I m going to GIVE you today 
These 5 income wonders deliver two things most  blue chip pretenders  don t 
Rock solid  and growing  7 5  average cash dividends  more than my portfolio s average  A share price that doesn t crumble beneath your feet while you re collecting these massive payouts  In fact  you can bank on 7  to 15  yearly price upside from these five  steady Eddie  picks With the Dow regularly lurching a stomach churning 1 000 points  or more  in a single day during pullbacks  I m sure a safe and growing 7 5  every single year would have a lot of appeal 
And remember  7 5  is just the average  One of these titans pays a SAFE 8 5  
Think about that for a second  buy this incredible stock now and every single year  nearly 9  of your original buy boomerangs straight back to you in CASH 
If that s not the very definition of safety  I don t know what is 
These five stout stocks have sailed through meltdown after meltdown with their share prices intact  doling out huge cash dividends the entire time  Owners of these amazing  2008 proof  plays might have wondered what all the fuss was about 
These five  2008 proof  wonders give you the best of both worlds  a 7 5  CASH dividend that jumps year in and year out  with your feet firmly planted on a share price that holds steady in a market inferno and floats higher when stocks go Zen

100077,321592,AVGO,Huawei s Android Alternative Debuts,news," Bloomberg     Huawei Technologies Co  took the wraps off its   HarmonyOS  operating system Friday  offering the first glimpses of in house software that may someday replace Google s  NASDAQ GOOGL  Android and reduce its reliance on American technology 
To begin with  the open source software will skip smartphones and instead find its way into everything from cars and watches to personal computers by 2020  said Richard Yu  chief executive of the consumer business  Earbuds and virtual reality goggles will follow 
 Because we support Google s Android ecosystem  we will prioritize Android for smartphones  If we can t use Android  we can install HarmonyOS quickly   Yu told reporters at Huawei s developers conference in Dongguan   We had a great chance to become the world s biggest vendor by shipment    if not for the trade war  
HarmonyOS  previously code named  Hongmeng  or  Ark   is an important part of Huawei s effort to develop alternatives in response to sanctions on American technology it needs to make its gear  Underscoring the unpredictability of supply  Bloomberg News reported the White House is delaying a decision about licenses for U S  companies to resume selling to Huawei 
China s largest technology company has found itself at the center of sensitive trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington  with the latter accusing its geopolitical rival of stealing technology and posing a risk to U S  national security  Irrespective of how the talks play out  Trump administration curbs have all but smothered Huawei s goal of overtaking Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co  to become the world s largest maker of smartphones 
 Our HarmonyOS is more powerful and secure than Android  and it has greater distributed capability and is future facing   Yu said    Can HarmonyOS be installed on smartphones  Of course  
The efficacy of HarmonyOS is something Huawei still has to prove  Yu went into back end technical details but refrained from describing consumer facing features  suggesting it may not yet be ready for prime time 
For HarmonyOS to work  Huawei will need developers to build apps for its ecosystem    a major question mark around its fledgling software  To help with app migration  HarmonyOS will be built on the Linux and Huawei s own LiteOS kernels for now  Yu said  which will change in future generations of the OS 
Two months into a Trump administration ban that cut off Huawei from American suppliers  Huawei is starting to feel the pinch  It warned of a tougher performance in the second half of 2019 and has been internally preparing for a drop in overseas smartphone shipments of a staggering 60 million units  Yu said Friday that sanctions imposed in May had already reduced smartphone shipments by more than 10 million units in the second quarter 
It has looked to its home turf to offset international headwinds  The company has assigned as many as 10 000 engineers  working across three shifts a day  to develop alternatives to American software and components  Huawei already designs its own HiSilicon Kirin processors  though it retains a reliance on U S  firms such as Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Inc  for additional wireless chips 
And it s focusing on domestic sales  the company commanded 37  of the Chinese smartphone market in the second quarter  according to IDC  giving it roughly the same share as the second and third largest vendors combined  Strong home market sales boosted Huawei s shipments by 24  to 118 million units in the first half  the company said earlier

100079,321594,AVGO,The Extreme Risks Of Trading Your Own Retirement Assets   December 11  2019,opinion,"Maybe you re a seasoned investor and have a good track record with stock picking  And you may have a robust retirement portfolio   perhaps including some Zacks Top Retirement stock selections such as 
Armada Hoffler Properties  AHH   Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO  and Banner  BANR  
If you did something similar  would it be advisable for you to trade your own retirement nest egg 
Perhaps   if you re the  one in a million  investor who can expertly manage risk and maintain unflinching emotional control in volatile markets  But for most  there may be better strategies to achieve long term retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires an altogether different investing philosophy and risk   reward understanding than building wealth for retirement 
How Diversification Differs from Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially generate outsized returns  its excessive concentrated risk can present huge perils for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets over nine decades found that just 4  of the best performing U S stocks generated all the market s gains  The rest were flat   the gains of the next 38  were wiped out by the bottom 58   which lost money 
For even the most expert stock pickers  the chances for long term achievement are thin 
Is it Possible to Invest  Rationally  
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
The Key Takeaway for Retirement Investors
When it comes to managing your assets for retirement  you must look at performance over the course of years and decades   not weeks or months  Because most traders generally tend to focus on the short term  they may not have the right mindset to achieve successful long term outcomes 
We re not saying you should not trade at all   far from it  If you enjoy trading  perhaps you should put 10  of your investable assets to work in short term investments to seek alpha and outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Broadcom Inc  and Impinj are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that AVGO likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PI has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
AVGO currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 54  while PI has a forward P E of 2 311 50  We also note that AVGO has a PEG ratio of 1 26  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  PI currently has a PEG ratio of 115 57 
Another notable valuation metric for AVGO is its P B ratio of 5 81  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  PI has a P B of 6 65 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to AVGO s Value grade of B and PI s Value grade of F

Maybe   if you re an exceptional investor who can expertly manage risk and keep up perfectly resolute emotional control in the face of market volatility  Be that as it may  for most investors  there might be better ways to accomplish long term retirement investing objectives 
That s because the risk   reward scenario and investing approach is completely different for long term wealth building and active stock trading 
Diversification vs  Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
In fact  a study done by Hendrik Bessembinder revealed that only 4  of equities produced all of the stock market s gains over the last 90 years  All other stocks  broke even  with the increases of 38  canceled out by the losses of the bottom 58  
For even the most expert stock pickers  the chances for long term achievement are thin 
Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Most people think they can make rational investment decisions  but research indicates the opposite is often true  Investors followed in a DALBAR study performed significantly worse than the S P 500  For the 30 years between 1986 to 2015  the average investor earned just 3 66   whereas the S P 500 produced a 10 35  return 
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
The Key Takeaway for Retirement Investors
When it comes to managing your assets for retirement  you must look at performance over the course of years and decades   not weeks or months  Because most traders generally tend to focus on the short term  they may not have the right mindset to achieve successful long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns

100109,321624,AVGO,Earnings Preview  Broadcom Inc   AVGO  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 12  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  5 37 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 2  
Revenues are expected to be  5 76 billion  up 5 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Broadcom Inc 
For Broadcom Inc The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 38  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Broadcom Inc  Will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Broadcom Inc  Would post earnings of  5 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 16  delivering a surprise of  0 98  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Broadcom Inc  Doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-12-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-broadcom-inc-avgo-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200490449,200490449

100142,321657,AVGO,Trump says China trade talks  back on track   new tariffs on hold,news,"By Roberta Rampton and Michael Martina OSAKA  Reuters    The United States and China agreed on Saturday to restart trade talks after President Donald Trump offered concessions including no new tariffs and an easing of restrictions on tech company Huawei in order to reduce tensions with Beijing  China agreed to make unspecified new purchases of U S  farm products and return to the negotiating table  No deadline was set for progress on a deal  and the world s two largest economies remain at odds over significant parts of an agreement  The last major round of talks collapsed in May   Financial markets  which have been rattled by the nearly year long trade war  are likely to cheer the truce  Washington and Beijing have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars of each other s imports  threatening to put the brakes on an already slowing global economy  Those tariffs remain in place while negotiations resume   We re right back on track   Trump told reporters after an 80 minute meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit of leaders of the Group of 20  G20  major economies in Osaka  Japan   We re holding back on tariffs and they re going to buy farm products   Trump said  without giving details about the purchases  The U S  president had threatened to slap new levies on roughly  300 billion of additional Chinese goods  including popular consumer products  if the meeting in Japan proved unsuccessful  Such a move would have extended existing tariffs to almost all Chinese imports into the United States  In a lengthy statement on the two way talks  China s foreign ministry quoted Xi as telling Trump he hoped the United States could treat Chinese companies fairly   China is sincere about continuing negotiations with the United States     but negotiations should be equal and show mutual respect   the foreign ministry quoted Xi as saying  Trump offered an olive branch to Xi on Huawei  the world s biggest telecom network gear maker  The Trump administration has said the Chinese firm is too close to China s government and poses a national security risk  and has lobbied U S  allies to keep Huawei out of next generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure  Trump s Commerce Department has put Huawei on its  entity list   effectively banning the company from buying parts and components from U S  companies without U S  government approval  But Trump said on Saturday he did not think that was fair to U S  suppliers  who were upset by the move   We re allowing that  because that wasn t national security   he said  CHEERS FROM CHIP MAKERS Trump said the U S  Commerce Department would study in the next few days whether to take Huawei off the list of firms banned from buying components and technology from U S  companies without government approval  China welcomed the step    If the U S  does what it says  then of course  we welcome it   said Wang Xiaolong  the Chinese foreign ministry s envoy for G20 affairs  U S  microchip makers also applauded the move   We are encouraged the talks are restarting and additional tariffs are on hold and we look forward to getting more detail on the president s remarks on Huawei   John Neuffer  president of the U S  Semiconductor Association  said in a statement  Trump said he and Xi did not discuss the extradition proceedings against Meng Wanzhou  Huawei s chief financial officer  who was arrested in Canada in December on charges alleging she misled global banks about Huawei s relationship with a company in Iran  Huawei has come under mounting scrutiny for over a year  led by U S  allegations that  back doors  in its routers  switches and other gear could allow China to spy on U S  communications  The company has denied its products pose a security threat  It declined to comment on the developments on Saturday  The problems at Huawei have filtered across to the broader chip industry  with Broadcom Inc  O AVGO  warning of a broad slowdown in demand and cutting its revenue forecast  RELIEF AND SCEPTICISM Financial markets and businesses worldwide were eager to get relief from the U S  China trade war   Returning to negotiations is good news for the business community and breathes some much needed certainty into a slowly deteriorating relationship   said Jacob Parker  a vice president of China operations at the U S  China Business Council   Now comes the hard work of finding consensus on the most difficult issues in the relationship  but with a commitment from the top we re hopeful this will put the two sides on a sustained path to resolution   he said  Some  however  warned the pause might not last    Even if a truce happens this weekend  a subsequent breakdown of talks followed by further escalation still seems likely   Capital Economics said in a commentary on Friday  The United States says China has been stealing American intellectual property for years  forces U S  firms to share trade secrets as a condition for doing business in China  and subsidizes state owned firms to dominate industries  China has said the United States is making unreasonable demands and must also make concessions  The negotiations hit an impasse in May after Washington accused Beijing of reneging on reform pledges made during months of talks  Trump raised tariffs to 25  from 10  on  200 billion of Chinese goods  and China retaliated by raising levies on a list of U S  imports  There are other irritants in the relationship  Trump said Xi raised the treatment of Chinese students and the president  bucking many of his fellow Republicans  said he did not think there should be restrictions on them entering the United States  Some lawmakers have urged new rules on the subject for national security reasons  The U S  China feud cast a pall over the two day G20 gathering  with leaders pointing to the threat to global growth   In their communique  the leaders warned of growing risks to the world economy but stopped short of denouncing protectionism  calling instead for a free  fair trade environment after talks some members described as difficult

100143,321658,AVGO,The Extreme Risks Of Trading Your Own Retirement Assets   November 07  2019,opinion,"Maybe you re a seasoned investor and have a good track record with stock picking  And you may have a robust retirement portfolio   perhaps including some Zacks Top Retirement stock selections such as 
Horizon Bancorp  HBNC   CVS Health  NYSE CVS  and Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
Maybe   if you re an exceptional investor who can expertly manage risk and keep up perfectly resolute emotional control in the face of market volatility  Be that as it may  for most investors  there might be better ways to accomplish long term retirement investing objectives 
Active stock trading requires a very different investing approach and risk   reward mindset than investing for retirement 
Diversification vs  Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially generate outsized returns  its excessive concentrated risk can present huge perils for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets spanning nine decades revealed that only 4  of the best performing U S stocks produced all the market s increases  The rest were flat   the gains of the following 38  were offset by the losses of the bottom 58  
Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is it Possible to Invest  Rationally  
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
When it comes to managing your assets for retirement  you must look at performance over the course of years and decades   not weeks or months  Because most traders generally tend to focus on the short term  they may not have the right mindset to achieve successful long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should give up trading  Not necessarily  One solution is to take 10  of your investable assets and trade to generate alpha and seek outsized returns 
But the point we re making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative  long term approach designed to produce reliable returns  so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals

100145,321660,AVGO,Powerful Proof Anyone Can Invest For An Early Retirement   November 08  2019,opinion,"Accomplishing the financial cushion to retire early is a fantasy for most  Bringing the fantasy to reality is not as difficult as it sounds  The key is straightforward  Save significantly more every month  Sounds simple  correct  One moment 
Typically  advisors peg 15  to 20  of total income saved each month as a goal   but if you want to retire earlier  you probably have to ratchet that number up to 40  or 50  of your income  Not a feat easily accomplished when you review your take into account that a good portion of your paycheck goes to essential  non negotiable lifestyle items  However  if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle changes and sacrifices  it s possible 
A relatively new movement called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been developed around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  concept  FIRE followers develop strict savings programs  up to 75  of income  and make associated sacrifices like living in small apartments  walking to work every day  restrictive diets  and so on  This path may be too restrictive for many  but the mindset offers some takeaways that might be worth considering 
To start  stick with the essentials of long term growth investing  Build a diversified portfolio of stocks with exposure to various styles  sizes  sectors  and regions 
To accelerate the retirement investment cycle  you can construct a portfolio designed with more risk   and the potential for higher returns   but it should still be appropriately diversified to protect against larger than average market drawdowns that can be difficult to recover from and ruin any chance to accomplish your early retirement goal  There are numerous ways to diversify a portfolio  and how you do so should depend on your age  your risk tolerance  your growth and income needs  and your long term goals 
Once you have accelerated your savings and put an ongoing plan in place  invest your savings into your portfolio as soon as possible  Don t try to time the market  Leave your portfolio alone  and let the compounding nature of the markets do its magic to help grow your retirement nest egg exponentially over time 
Growth stocks with low beta  strong earnings estimates  positive sales growth  and expected future growth are an excellent way to determine investable growth stocks for your retirement 
The Zacks Rank regularly identifies attractive growth stocks ideal for retirement investing  Here are just a few that might be worth consideration  Cedar Fair  L P   FUN   Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO  and EPR Properties  EPR   These are top ranked stocks  with at least 5  earnings and sales growth over the past five years  and boast beta equal to or lower than 1

Most people think they can make rational investment decisions  but research indicates the opposite is often true  Investors followed in a DALBAR study performed significantly worse than the S P 500  For the 30 years between 1986 to 2015  the average investor earned just 3 66   whereas the S P 500 produced a 10 35  return 
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio ought to be dealt with a technique of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self coordinated investors will in general miss the mark with regards to long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns 
But the point we re making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative  long term approach designed to produce reliable returns  so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals

100216,321731,AVGO,StockBeat  UBS Feels China s Wrath After Swine Fever Comments,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    UBS Group AG  NYSE UBS  is feeling the heat of Chinese wrath Friday  its stock down 2  by 6 30 AM ET  1030 GMT   amid fears that it may lose precious business as the result of a flippant remark by one of its economists about the swine flu epidemic that has ravaged China s pork industry this year 
That puts it at the bottom of a Swiss market that is down 0 5  overall  although Switzerland is faring better than most European bourses on a day when a gloomy outlook by U S  chipmaker Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  revived fears of a global economic downturn  Germany s Dax is down 0 9  while the U K  FTSE is down 0 7   The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 is down 0 7  at 377 58 
Paul Donovan  chief economist at UBS s Global Wealth Management unit  was accused of racism after a podcast in which he discussed the impact of an epidemic that led to pork prices rising 18  last month  a big enough rise to drive overall Chinese inflation to a 15 month high of 2 7  
In an attempt to put that into the broader economic context  Donovan asked rhetorically in the UBS Morning Audio Comment whether that mattered  answering his own question 
 It matters if you are a Chinese pig  It matters if you like eating pork in China  It does not really matter to the rest of the world  
His point was that the outbreak was likely to have little longer lasting impact that could affect the price of Chinese or global assets  However  he was quickly accused of racism  not least by an economist at one of UBS s competitors in Hong Kong 
Hao Hong  head of research at Bank of Communications International  the state run Chinese bank s Hong Kong unit  accused Donovan in a Twitter post of  distasteful and racist language  according to the Financial Times  The Global Times  an English language mouthpiece for the Communist Party  took up the theme   a storm of outrage on Chinese social media 
Despite apologies from UBS and from Donovan personally  the Hong Kong Securities Association said it  urges UBS to terminate the employment of the staff involved  and report the result to the Chinese public  
It also demanded  the management of UBS make an open and formal apology  and to ensure that such incidents will not occur again  
The incident puts UBS in an awkward position  Since slashing its once freewheeling investment bank  it has come to rely more and more on the fees it generates from Donovan s division  which manages the wealth of the world s ultra rich  The biggest single growth market for that division is  of course  China  not least since its U S  business has been crimped for years by the after effects of a brush with U S  authorities over abetting tax evasion   Asia accounted for nearly 80  of the division s  22 billion in net new assets under management in the first quarter of the year
But if UBS fires Donovan  it risks getting a reputation for becoming the sort of bank that bows to political pressure  That will damage its reputation in the rest of the world  even if putting a price on that damage is hard 
The incident underlines the risks of business models   especially models that revolve around the exchange of ideas such as giving investment advice   that depend on China  where public discourse is tightly controlled  The country s image abroad has suffered this week from coverage of demonstrations in Hong Kong  which showed police firing rubber bullets and pepper spray at protesters objecting to a new law that allows citizens to be extradited to the Chinese mainland for trial

100218,321733,AVGO,Easy Investing Secrets To An Early Retirement   October 07  2019,opinion,"Achieving the financial freedom to retire early a dream for most  Making that dream a reality isn t as tricky as it sounds  The secret is simple  Save a lot more each month  Sounds easy  right  Not so fast 
Usually  advisors advise 15  to 20  of total income saved every month as an objective   yet in the event that you want to retire earlier  you likely need to tighten that number up to 40  or half of your pay  Not a discipline easily practiced when you review or consider that a substantial segment of your paycheck goes to basic  non  negotiable lifestyle needs  But if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle adjustments and trade offs  it s achievable 
A generally new development called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been created around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  idea  FIRE supporters create exacting savings plans  up to 75  of income  and make related compromises like living in small homes  walking to work every day  prohibitive weight control plans  etc  This way might be unreasonably prohibitive for many  yet the mentality offers a few takeaways that may merit consideration 
The first point is to adhere to the key principles of long term investing  including developing a diversified portfolio that includes stocks with various styles  sizes  sectors and regions 
To accelerate the retirement investment cycle  you can construct a portfolio designed with more risk   and the potential for higher returns   but it should still be appropriately diversified to protect against larger than average market drawdowns that can be difficult to recover from and ruin any chance to accomplish your early retirement goal  There are numerous ways to diversify a portfolio  and how you do so should depend on your age  your risk tolerance  your growth and income needs  and your long term goals 
Once you have accelerated your savings and put an ongoing plan in place  invest your savings into your portfolio as soon as possible  Don t try to time the market  Leave your portfolio alone  and let the compounding nature of the markets do its magic to help grow your retirement nest egg exponentially over time 
You may want to look at growth stocks with attributes acceptable for retirement investing like low beta  strong earnings estimates  positive sales growth  and expected future growth 
The Zacks Rank routinely recognizes lower risk growth retirement portfolio picks  and here are a few that may be worth considering  Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO  and Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO   These growth stocks have strong Zacks Ranks and a beta of 1 or lower  with earnings and sales growth of at least 5  over the past 5 years

100219,321734,AVGO,The Extreme Risks Of Trading Your Own Retirement Assets   October 08  2019,opinion,"You have a significant retirement portfolio  You re an experienced investor  You ve done pretty well at picking stocks  You probably even own a few of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
Heritage Commerce  HTBK   Preferred Apartment Communities  APTS  and Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
It could be a good idea   that is  if you are one of the very few investors who understands your own risk tolerance and can keep your emotions in check during chaotic market swings  However  if you re like the rest of us  there are likely more prudent ways to reach your retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires an altogether different investing philosophy and risk   reward understanding than building wealth for retirement 
Managing Retirement Investments  Stock Picking vs  Diversification
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets spanning nine decades revealed that only 4  of the best performing U S stocks produced all the market s increases  The rest were flat   the gains of the following 38  were offset by the losses of the bottom 58  
For even the most expert stock pickers  the chances for long term achievement are thin 
Is Investing Success All In Your Mind 
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
This study suggests that one key reason for investor underperformance is trying to time volatile markets   and that irrational behavior biases tend to compound investor mistakes 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
The Bottom Line for Retirement Investors
When it comes to managing your assets for retirement  you must look at performance over the course of years and decades   not weeks or months  Because most traders generally tend to focus on the short term  they may not have the right mindset to achieve successful long term outcomes 
We re not saying you should not trade at all   far from it  If you enjoy trading  perhaps you should put 10  of your investable assets to work in short term investments to seek alpha and outsized returns 
However  the major part of your wealth   those assets reserved for retirement   ought to be invested utilizing a more careful  conservative  risk management strategy to produce steady  compounded returns so you can securely achieve your retirement objectives

100224,321739,AVGO,Easy Investing Secrets To An Early Retirement   October 15  2019,opinion,"Building sufficient financial resources to retire early may sound like a dream  but making that dream come true is not as hard as it may sound  The main thing is simply to save more money each month  No big deal  right  Well   
Usually  advisors advise 15  to 20  of total income saved every month as an objective   yet in the event that you want to retire earlier  you likely need to tighten that number up to 40  or half of your pay  Not a discipline easily practiced when you review or consider that a substantial segment of your paycheck goes to basic  non  negotiable lifestyle needs  But if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle adjustments and trade offs  it s achievable 
A relatively new movement called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been developed around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  concept  FIRE followers develop strict savings programs  up to 75  of income  and make associated sacrifices like living in small apartments  walking to work every day  restrictive diets  and so on  This path may be too restrictive for many  but the mindset offers some takeaways that might be worth considering 
To start  stick with the essentials of long term growth investing  Build a diversified portfolio of stocks with exposure to various styles  sizes  sectors  and regions 
To accelerate the retirement investment cycle  you can construct a portfolio designed with more risk   and the potential for higher returns   but it should still be appropriately diversified to protect against larger than average market drawdowns that can be difficult to recover from and ruin any chance to accomplish your early retirement goal  There are numerous ways to diversify a portfolio  and how you do so should depend on your age  your risk tolerance  your growth and income needs  and your long term goals 
Once you have accelerated your savings and put an ongoing plan in place  invest your savings into your portfolio as soon as possible  Don t try to time the market  Leave your portfolio alone  and let the compounding nature of the markets do its magic to help grow your retirement nest egg exponentially over time 
You may want to look at growth stocks with attributes acceptable for retirement investing like low beta  strong earnings estimates  positive sales growth  and expected future growth 
Zacks offers investors useful rankings for lower risk growth stocks for retirement portfolios  The following are a few selections that merit a closer look  Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO   American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO  and Preferred Apartment Communities  APTS   Earnings and revenue has seen growth of at least 5  or higher over the last five years  with a beta of 1 or lower

100283,321798,AVGO,StockBeat   Infineon  STMicro Fall as Huawei Ban Roils Chip Market,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    When the elephants fight  it s the ants that get trampled 
Europe s biggest chipmakers Infineon Technologies  DE IFXGn  and STMicroelectronics  PA STM    elephants in their own backyard   are getting a taste of life as an ant this morning as the trade dispute between China and the U S  threatens to spiral out of control 
The two companies have been put in an awkward place by last week s executive order from the U S  effectively banning U S  companies dealing directly with telecoms giant Huawei without a government license  Reports over the weekend suggested that companies from Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  to Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  had already stopped selling to the Chinese giant 
According to a report by Japan s Nikkei Asian Review  Germany s Infineon has suspended sales to Huawei for fear of causing itself legal trouble in the U S   while French based STMicro  PA STM  has scheduled meetings with the Chinese company for later this week to clarify its situation 
As of 4 AM ET  0800 GMT   Infineon was down 3 1   while STMicro was down 3 8   both at the bottom of their respective indexes  Germany s Dax and the CAC 40 were both down a little less than 0 1   while the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 opened the week effectively flat at 381 60 
According to Nikkei  Infineon s direct sales to Huawei are minimal   less than  100 million a year  compared to annual revenue of  7 94 billion euros  For STMicro  the direct impact would be larger as Huawei is one of its 10 biggest clients  according to regulatory filings cited by Reuters 
However  it isn t just the direct effects that the two companies need to worry about  Restrictions on sales to China  the world s biggest market for semiconductors  will create yet more overcapacity headaches for the industry outside China  putting more pressure on prices and margins 
It s less than two months since Infineon was forced to cut its outlook for both revenue and profit this year due to  continued sluggishness in end markets   while STMicro kept its guidance  but trimmed its planned capital expenditure 
Even if demand does pick up  the German company said it would only slowly feed through to the bottom line because global inventories are already at high levels  Huawei has been stockpiling for months to protect itself against being cut off from western suppliers  according to various reports ",2019-05-20,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat--infineon-stmicro-fall-as-huawei-ban-roils-chip-market-1872994,1872994

Irrespective of the result  the presidency of the powerful European Commission is likely to remain in the hands of either the center right European People s Party  which includes German Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats  or one of its centrist or center left rivals  However  a big gain in seats for the fringe parties could make it harder for the EU to adopt any major legislation for the next five years  given the now extensive powers of the EU parliament

100312,321827,AVGO,Trump administration hits China s Huawei with one two punch,news,"By David Shepardson and Karen Freifeld WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    The Trump administration on Wednesday took aim at China s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  banning the firm from buying vital U S  technology without special approval and effectively barring its equipment from U S  telecom networks on national security grounds  Taken together  the two moves threaten Huawei s ability to continue to sell many products because of its reliance on American suppliers  and represents a significant escalation in the U S  government s worldwide campaign against the company  The steps also come at a delicate time in relations between China and the United States as the world s two largest economies ratchet up tariffs in a battle over what U S  officials call China s unfair trade practices   Washington believes the handsets and network equipment for telecommunications companies made by Huawei could be used by the Chinese state to spy on Americans   Huawei  which has repeatedly denied the allegations  said in a statement that  restricting Huawei from doing business in the U S  will not make the U S  more secure or stronger  instead  this will only serve to limit the U S  to inferior yet more expensive alternatives  leaving the U S  lagging behind in 5G deployment     In addition  unreasonable restrictions will infringe upon Huawei s rights and raise other serious legal issues   The ban on U S  suppliers  which appears similar to one on Huawei rival ZTE Corp  HK 0763   last year  could hit the shares of Huawei s biggest U S  suppliers  including chipmakers Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Inc   In the first action taken on Wednesday  President Donald Trump signed a long awaited executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U S  companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing a national security risk  The order invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act  which gives the president the authority to regulate commerce in response to a national emergency that threatens the United States  It directs the Commerce Department  working with other government agencies  to draw up an enforcement plan by October  Members of Congress said Trump s order was squarely aimed at Chinese companies like Huawei  which generated  93 billion in revenue last year and is seen as a national champion in China   China s main export is espionage  and the distinction between the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese  private sector  businesses like Huawei is imaginary   Republican Senator Ben Sasse said  ENTITY LIST Soon after the White House announced the order had been signed  the Commerce Department said it had added Huawei and 70 affiliates to its so called Entity List   a move that bans the telecom giant from buying parts and components from U S  companies without U S  government approval  U S  officials told Reuters the decision would make it difficult  if not impossible  for Huawei  the largest telecommunications equipment producer in the world  to sell some products because of its reliance on U S  suppliers  It will take effect in the coming days  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Trump backed the decision that will  prevent American technology from being used by foreign owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U S  national security or foreign policy interests   With Huawei on the Entity List  U S  suppliers will need to apply for licenses to provide the Chinese company with anything subject to U S  export control regulations  Obtaining such licenses will be difficult because they will have to show the transfer of items will not harm U S  national security  said John Larkin  a former export control officer in Beijing for the Commerce Department   The United States in January unsealed a 13 count indictment against Huawei accusing the company and its chief financial officer of conspiring to defraud global financial institutions by misrepresenting Huawei s relationship with a suspected front company that operated in Iran  The indictment was unsealed a month after CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada on a U S  warrant for her role in the alleged fraud  Meng  who maintains her innocence  is fighting extradition  5G NETWORKS Reuters reported on Tuesday that Trump was expected to sign his long awaited executive order this week  The order does not specifically name any country or company  but U S  officials have previously labeled Huawei a  threat   The United States has been actively pushing other countries not to use the Chinese company s equipment in next generation 5G networks that it calls  untrustworthy   In August  Trump signed a bill that barred the U S  government from using equipment from Huawei and another Chinese provider  ZTE Corp  ZTE was added to the Commerce Department s Entity List in March 2016 over allegations it organized an elaborate scheme to hide its re export of U S  items to sanctioned countries in violation of U S  law  The restrictions prevented suppliers from providing ZTE with U S  equipment  potentially freezing the company s supply chain  but the restrictions were suspended in a series of temporary reprieves  allowing the company to maintain ties to U S  suppliers until it agreed to a plea deal a year later  The status of Huawei and ZTE has taken on new urgency as U S  wireless carriers rollout 5G networks  
While the big wireless companies have already cut ties with Huawei  small rural carriers continue to rely on both Huawei and ZTE switches and other equipment because they tend to be cheaper  Trump s order applies to future purchases and does not address existing hardware  officials said Wednesday ",2019-05-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-administration-hits-chinas-huawei-with-onetwo-punch-1869596,1869596

Many are expecting lawmakers in Brussels to grant the U K  a short delay to Brexit  but remain wary the EU could attached strings to an extension

100349,321864,AVGO,These Huge Dividends Are Perfect For The Next 6 Months,opinion,"The trade war panic is in full retreat and it s left us three ridiculously cheap funds set to soar even higher than the market in the coming months 
Best of all  we ll bag some very nice dividends from this trio  I m talking outsized yields up to 7 4  
Before I show them to you  let s talk about why the market looks set to head higher 
Right now  the SPDR S P 500 ETF  SPY  NYSE SPY   is up 18 3  for 2019  This sounds too good to last  but keep in mind that this jump started near the depths of the late 2018 correction a low level 
That makes the year to date number misleading  a longer term view shows signs of consistent and slow recovery from 2018 s major volatility 
A Steadying Market
There are a lot of reasons for this  but the two most important ones are good signs for stocks 
For one  US GDP growth is strong  up 3 1  in the first quarter  and second quarter growth is forecast at a still robust 1 9   according to the Federal Reserve  That means the recession fears that were priced into stocks in 2018 were wrong and stocks still need to rise to fully price in this current growth clip 
Speaking of the Fed  the market now expects the central bank to cut interest rates  and the Fed itself has said as much  Why  Because even with strong growth  inflation is stubbornly low  so there s no reason to keep raising rates  as the Fed has already done over the last five years 
So if America s economy is growing and interest rates are about to fall again  we should expect American stocks to benefit the most  But which will be the biggest winners 
Instead of picking them one by one  let s look at three funds that not only choose stocks well  thanks to smart strategies  but also pay out above average dividends to investors from the capital each fund earns

The first fund playing this economic growth right is Source Capital  SOR   which has put a quarter of its assets in companies like Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   United Technologies  NYSE UTX  and American International Group  NYSE AIG  three stocks that alone account for 10  of SOR s assets  Those holdings are up 24 5  since the start of the year  but we ve only seen tech and financials begin to recover from their 2018 weakness setting us up for more gains ahead 
Monster Gains for Source s Wise Picks
More importantly  SOR trades cheap  which means you get these stocks at a discount  That s because SOR is a closed end fund  CEF   a type of fund that often trades at market prices below their net asset value  or NAV   another name for the liquidation value of a CEF s portfolio 
And right now  SOR s market price is 13 7  lower than its liquidation value  so you re getting these stocks cheaper than if you got them through an index fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust  NASDAQ QQQ   or if you bought them one by one 
Dividend Fund  2  A 6  Dividend From a CEF All Star Team
There is a downside  SOR s dividend yield is just 2 8   which is low for a tech heavy CEF  If you want more income and top performing tech stocks  the BlackRock  NYSE BLK  Science and Technology Trust  BST  might be for you  It yields 5 7  
I ve written about BST before including last Thursday when I named it my favorite of the tech focused CEFs  Just look at its total return versus QQQ 
Outperforming the Market With Income
BST has a dividend yield over five times higher than that of QQQ and it s still able to outperform the index fund by a huge and growing margin 
How does it do it 
The answer may surprise you  management  BST s managers have consistently picked winning stocks that outrun the well known stalwarts of the tech world 
What this means is that  beyond the FAANG stocks you d expect  those account for 25  of BST s portfolio   the fund s managers have shrewdly picked and timed purchases in breakout names like top holdings Alibaba  NYSE BABA   Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  and Tencent  0070  
That strong record usually comes at a price  though  thanks to its market beating returns  BST has attracted a high valuation in the past and recently traded at a 9  premium to NAV  But today it s trading at a rare 1 5  discount  which means the premium could very easily return in the coming months 
Dividend Fund  3  Greater Income  Greater Safety
If 5 7  still isn t enough of a dividend yield  I have just the fund for you  the Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance Tax Advantaged Dividend Income Fund  EVT   which trades at its NAV and pays a huge 7 4  dividend yield 
EVT has given investors a monster 29  total return over the last year  versus just 19  for the S P 500  making it yet another market outperformer 
That s not surprising  EVT s biggest holdings are popular S P 500 names like JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   This fund is very balanced  with about 10  or less of its assets in sectors such as tech  industrials  healthcare  energy  utilities and real estate 
Its biggest exposure is to the financial sector  which is up 15 4  in 2019 and set to keep going higher thanks to the booming economy

100409,321924,AVGO,Huawei Clash Shows Deeper U S  China Battle for Global Influence,news," Bloomberg     The Trump administration has insisted the arrest of a top Huawei  SZ 002502  executive has nothing to do with trade talks  In Beijing  it s just the latest U S  move to contain China s rise as a global power 
Bail hearings proceeded this week after Meng Wanzhou  the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co   was arrested in Canada on Dec  1 because of alleged violations of U S  sanctions against Iran  The case threatens to derail a trade truce struck the same day between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping 
Even if the two leaders manage to strike a broader deal  the arrest shows that the U S  China conflict goes far beyond trade  The world s biggest economies are now engaged in a battle for global influence that will ultimately determine whether the U S  remains the globe s predominant superpower  or China rises as a viable counterweight 
 The sentiment in Washington now is not just a Trumpian mercantilism    the desire to bring back factory jobs to Wisconsin or wherever   said Nick Bisley  a professor of international relations at La Trobe University in Melbourne who has written books on great power politics   It is a desire to significantly cut ties with China because of that larger perception it presents a strategic risk  
A bipartisan consensus has emerged in Washington that China s entry into the World Trade Organization hollowed out U S  manufacturing and allowed it to grow rich  That increased economic power is now at a point where it risks eroding key American military advantages around the globe 
China insists it plays by the rules  and doesn t challenge U S  dominance  Even so  three areas in particular worry American strategic planners  Technology  the dollar and the ability to project military power overseas 
Technological Prowess
A year ago  the White House identified China s growing technological prowess as a threat to U S  economic and military might  American companies have long argued that China forces them to transfer intellectual property and sometimes steals trade secrets    all of which Beijing denies 
In justifying tariffs  Trump s team has cited Beijing s  Made in China 2025  strategy to become a global leader in state of the art technologies from aerospace to robotics  So far  China has resisted those demands  arguing that doing so would crush its economic potential 
Huawei in particular epitomizes the threat  Earlier this year  Trump blocked Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Inc  s  117 billion hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  over concerns that Huawei would end up dominating the market for computer chips and wireless technologies 
The fear is that wireless carriers may be forced to turn to Huawei or other Chinese companies for 5G technology  potentially giving Beijing access to critical communications  Those concerns have prompted the U S  to ban Huawei s products for government procurement  and Australia  Japan and New Zealand have reportedly followed 
China has fought back  with foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang saying this week that Huawei doesn t  force any enterprise to install forced backdoors  
 The competition is really focused in the areas where future strategic and economic dominance come from   said Michael Shoebridge  director of the defense and strategy program at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute   The Huawei arrest is right in the middle of this because both America and China see their future global power as coming from the high tech sector  
Almighty Dollar
The dominance of the dollar has allowed the U S  to effectively control the world s financial system  underpinning its superpower status  Yet Trump s increased use of sanctions to assert its foreign policy goals has prompted a wide range of nations    from China to Russia to the European Union    to look for an alternative 
The Trump administration added nearly 1 000 entities and individuals to its sanctions list in its first year  almost 30 percent more than the Obama administration s last year in office  according to law firm Gibson Dunn  The complete list now runs to more than 1 200 pages 
Sanctions are a key tool for the U S  to subdue potential adversaries like North Korea  but they also can affect friends and allies  The EU  which objected to reimposing sanctions on Iran  this month unveiled plans to mitigate the so called  exorbitant privilege  of the dollar 
During a visit to China last month  Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the two nations were looking at ways to boost the use of their currencies through allowing the use of China s UnionPay credit card in Russia and Russia s Mir card in China   No one currency should dominate the market   he said 
 We are potentially at the beginning of a systemic shift that may take some time to play out   said Gregory Chin  associate professor at York University in Toronto  and a political economy specialist   The political will is building and coalescing  
Belt and Road
Last year  Xi called his Belt and Road Initiative to finance infrastructure and development projects across the globe the  project of the century   Morgan Stanley says as much as  1 3 trillion may be lent out under the policy by 2027 
Now  with a backlash growing across Asia from Malaysia to the Maldives  Xi is playing defense  Last month he told the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that it was  not a trap as some people have labeled it  
The U S  has grown increasingly concerned that poorer countries may become economically dependent on China  The Pentagon warned earlier this year that China could use ports around the globe to support naval deployments 
Sri Lanka is a prime example of what could go wrong  It borrowed heavily to build a port on the Indian Ocean  couldn t repay the loans and then gave China a 99 year lease for debt relief 
Vice President Mike Pence attacked the Belt and Road at APEC shortly after Xi spoke  saying the U S  wouldn t  drown our partners in a sea of debt   He also outlined plans to finance  60 billion of infrastructure to support private investment 
 For the U S   the BRI is a direct challenge to its preeminence in the Asia Pacific region and beyond   said Brahma Chellaney  a professor of strategic studies at the New Delhi based Center for Policy Research   They realized that countries that are looking to BRI need an alternative  That s why they are developing a counter to it  ",2018-12-11,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/huawei-clash-shows-deeper-uschina-battle-for-global-influence-1717668,1717668
100410,321925,AVGO,Stocks   Dow Drops as Government Shutdown Threat Offsets Trade Optimism,news,"Investing com   The Dow closed lower Tuesday as President Donald Trump s threat to shut down the government if Congress doesn t fund his proposed border wall offset optimism on trade

Energy stocks  meanwhile  struggled for gains  even as oil prices pared losses from a day earlier  underpinned by an production outage in Libya 
In a sign of skittish sentiment  traders took shelter in defensive corners of the market like consumer staples  which rose 1  
Financials were abandoned for the second straight day  falling more than 1  on the back of ongoing weakness in bank stocks amid concerns over slowing economic growth and expectations for a slowdown in Fed rate hikes

100470,321985,AVGO,Stocks Enjoy Second Straight Week Of Gains ,opinion,"The market just completed a second straight week in the green  but more importantly it also held onto all of the gains made in last week s epic rally 
	Stocks slipped late in the session and ended slightly on negative ground by the close  However  the NASDAQ still advanced 0 7  over the past five days  while the S P and Dow each gained about a half percent 
	The tech heavy index had to deal with chipmaker Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  cutting its guidance for 2019  which took the air out of chipmakers and ultimately the whole market   
	The company blamed a good part of its troubles on the trade conflict with China  The stock plunged more than 5 5  on the day 
	Investors are concerned that Broadcom s problems are a signal that the ongoing trade impasse will be taking an increasingly bigger bite out of the market s growth potential  especially with the chipmakers 
	The NASDAQ had the worst performance on Friday by slipping 0 52   or 40 points  to 7796 66  but it had the best run for the week 
	The S P continues to loiter right under 2900 after a decline of 0 16  to 2886 98  The Dow was in positive territory until the last few minutes  It eventually dipped 0 07   or around 17 points  but stayed above 26 000 at 26 089 61   
	A sluggish end to a sluggish week as we move through low summer volume in front of a Fed meeting and the G 20  But there s nothing wrong with a little sluggishness right after the best rally of the year  so far  
	Recall that the Dow jumped 4 7  last week  while the S P was up 4 4  and the NASDAQ gained 3 9   The market managed to hold onto ALL of those gains and even add a little bit to them 
	Next week will be all about the Fed meeting on the 18th and 19th  The Committee has been the market s friend in 2019 and investors are expecting that to continue  A rate cut isn t predicted for Wednesday  but we will be watching the language of the Fed Chairman very closely 
	If the market likes what he has to say  then we could be talking about a third straight week of gains next Friday Today s Portfolio Highlights  Technology Innovators  It s never a good thing when a company guides below the consensus as Altair Engineering  ALTR  recently did  but Brian was impressed that the stock kept its status as a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Apparently  analysts see a lot of long term potential for this simulation technology company  The editor agrees  In addition to the durability of its earnings estimates  Brian also appreciates its solid earnings history with beats in three of the past four quarters  The most recent surprise was nearly 24   Read the complete commentary for more on the new addition of ALTR ETF Investor  Two of the more compelling investment themes right now is the rollout of 5G technology and real estate in this lower rate environment  Neena found a fund that incorporates both of these hot spaces  The Pacer Benchmark Data   Infrastructure Real Estate ETF  SRVR  is a unique name that holds real estate firms related to data and infrastructure  The index provider states that SRVR is  the sophisticated backbone of data centers  wireless towers and fiber optic networks that moves the economy s critical data and analytics   The fund also has a nice dividend yield of 2 12   The editor suggests a limit order for this trade  Learn more about this new addition in the full write up Value Investor   I listened to the Broadcom conference call this week and in the semiconductor industry  the trade war and the Huawei restrictions are both having a brutal impact on business  That slowdown  in revenue and earnings  is real 
	 Additionally  we know that many of the retailers are struggling too  It will get worse if the next traunch of  300 billion in tariffs goes on 
	 No one is saying a recession is imminent  but the economy has clearly slowed  There is a risk  however  that the Fed will appear to be panicking  so to speak  if they start cutting as soon as July 
	 But the Fed is also usually behind the curve so they may be a bit more pro active this time 
	 We ll know more after the press conference on June 19      Tracey Ryniec
	Have a Great Weekend

100471,321986,AVGO,Stocks To Dip To Support Zone Before Rising As New Market Cycle Begins ,opinion,"Summary 
The S P 500  SPX  rose 14 points last week to 2887  an increase of 0 5  
Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  fell 5  on mixed  earnings and a dim outlook based in part on the trade war concerns 
Our projection this week is for stocks to dip to support zone between 2800 2838 before rising again once a new market cycle begins 
The stock market posted modest gains last week as it focused on the possibility that central banks around the world would cut interest rates again  as I pointed out in the latest Market Week show 
This occurred despite the poor economic data that continues to emerge  While Japanese GDP exceed market expectations  the UK data disappointed including negative prints for GDP and manufacturing production  Meanwhile  US job openings  CPI  and retail sales all missed expectations  as Chinese industrial production also missed 

Our approach to technical analysis uses market cycles to project price action  Our analysis for the S P 500 is that based on this strong rally  the cycle has shifted out  This means that we are now only expecting a shallow declining phase before the new cycle begins with a new rally  Our expectation is for a down and then up the week  with our support zone at 2800 2838 
Amongst the individual stocks that moved significantly last week was Broadcom  AVGO   which fell 5  on Friday on mixed earnings  The company reported earnings per share of  5 21 and revenue of  5 5 billion  compared to analyst estimates of  5 19 and  5 7 billion  Management also lowered its guidance for the fiscal year to  22 5 billion  which was below the  24 3 consensus 
CEO Hock Tan explained that  We currently see a broad based slowdown in demand  which we believe is driven by continued geopolitical uncertainties  as well as the effects of export restrictions on one of our largest customers   That  of course  is Chinese telecom  Huawei  

Based on the market cycles for AVGO  we believe it may be entering the declining phase of its current cycle  After all  it hit our intermediate resistance zone and failed  While it is relatively early in this cycle  we believe this is a bearish indicator and are watching closely to see if it breaks the cycle low at  250  which is the point from which it started the rising phase of this cycle  While the stock may hold up for a few weeks  this overall trading pattern suggests that breakdown may not be far off

The company  whose clients include chipmakers such as Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  Inc  Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Inc and STMicroelectronics  said it would indefinitely put on hold research on the smaller  faster 7 nanometer technology 
Earlier on Monday  AMD said that it would move all of its 7 nanometer production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co  the market leader in the foundry  or contract market for making chips for firms without plants of their own

GlobalFoundries  share stood at about 10 percent last year  with United Microelectronics at 8 percent and Samsung  KS 005930  at 7 4 percent

100496,322011,AVGO,Top 5 Things to Know in The Market on Thursday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  September 6 
1  Markets Brace for More U S  Tariffs on China
Investors continued to monitor the threat of fresh U S  tariffs on another  200 billion worth of Chinese goods  which could come as soon as a public comment period ends at midnight in Washington on Thursday 
China s commerce ministry warned that Beijing will be forced to retaliate if Washington implements new tariff measures 
The world s two largest economies have already applied tariffs to  50 billion of each other s goods  Talks aimed at easing tensions ended last month without major breakthroughs 
Washington is demanding Beijing improve market access and intellectual property protections for U S  companies  cut industrial subsidies and slash a  375 billion trade gap 
Investors are also watching for developments as the U S  and Canada resume talks about revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   Canada insisted there was room to salvage the pact despite few signs a deal was imminent 
2  Labor Market Data Ahead
On the data front  the market s attention will shift to the U S  labor market with the ADP s report on private payroll growth  which is often seen as a warmup act for the big Friday government nonfarm payrolls report  and the weekly report on initial jobless claims both set for release in the morning 
Economists expect the ADP report to show that private payroll growth totaled 188 000 during August 
Elsewhere on the economic calendar on Thursday  the August read on service sector activity from Markit Economics as well as the Institute for Supply Management s gauge on non manufacturing economic activity will also be released 
Factory orders for July are also set to be published 
Economists reckon the data will do little to alter expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates two more times this year  with the next move higher coming at its September 25 26 meeting 
The dollar was steady against a currency basket 
3  U S  Stocks Futures Point to Higher Open
U S  stock index futures pointed to a slightly higher open on Wall Street  although fresh losses in emerging markets and worries Washington will follow through on plans to levy an extra  200 billion of Chinese imports kept investors on the edge 
At 5 45AM ET  the blue chip Dow futures were up 60 points  or 0 25   the S P 500 futures tacked on 4 points  or 0 15   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 9 points  or roughly 0 1  
A sharp sell off in tech pushed the Nasdaq Composite and S P 500 lower on Wednesday 
On the earnings front  the week s lone report from the S P 500 will come after the market close when Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  reports results  Other companies reporting results Thursday include Barnes   Noble  NYSE BKS   GameStop  NYSE GME   and Five Below  NASDAQ FIVE  
Elsewhere  in Europe  the pan regional STOXX 600 benchmark hit its lowest level since early April in early trading but later turned slightly positive to trade up 0 2   supported by gains among utility stocks 
Earlier  in Asia  markets in the region skidded for a sixth straight session with investor confidence shaken by turmoil in emerging markets and jitters over a potentially severe escalation in the U S  China trade war 
4  EIA s Weekly Oil Supply Report
In commodities  the U S  Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended August 31 at 11 00AM ET 
The data comes out one day later than usual due to Monday s Labor Day holiday 
After markets closed Wednesday  the American Petroleum Institute said that U S  oil inventories fell by 1 17 million barrels last week 
U S  West Texas Intermediate WTI crude futures were at  68 83 per barrel  up 11 cents  or 0 2   from their last settlement 
International Brent crude oil futures were at  77 64 per barrel  36 cents  or 0 5   higher from their last close 
5  Bitcoin Taking It on The Chin Again
Bitcoin prices continued to take a hit  plunging for the second day in a row following a report that Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  was dropping its plans for opening a trading desk for cryptocurrencies 
The world s most valuable digital currency was last down around 13   or  960  at  6 422 30 on the Bitfinex exchange  after falling to as low as  6 302 20  a level last seen on August 22 
Beyond Bitcoin  the price of the other major cryptocurrencies also continued to drop 
Ethereum  the world s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap  was down 20  at  227 00  its worst level since September 2017 
Meanwhile  XRP was trading at  0 28689  down roughly 9  for the day  while Litecoin was down 15  at  55 33 ",2018-09-06,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-thursday-1599917,1599917

100498,322013,AVGO,Lacking Catalysts  Stocks Tread Water As Profit Taking Surfaces,opinion," Wednesday Market Open  Wall Street seems a bit out of breath after its fast climb over the last week  There s a heavy feeling in the air early Wednesday following Tuesday s lower session 
We re arguably at a crossroads  Many investors are suffering from FOMO  Fear Of Missing Out  syndrome  meaning they re afraid of missing possible gains if the trade battle with China is settled  So there s a hesitancy to sell 
On the other hand  the market is near the top of its recent range between roughly 2750 and 2950 for the S P 500 index  SPX   so new buying interest could be hard to find  and a bit of profit taking appears to be creeping in  All this means stocks might continue to be range bound  characterized by back and forth  directionless trading  Especially on a day like Wednesday where it s hard to find any new catalysts 
One possible economic warning sign emerged early this week as crude prices dipped again following a recent rebound  U S  crude traded back under  52 a barrel early Wednesday as an industry report revealed growing U S  supplies and the U S  government lowered its world demand growth forecast  Sometimes softness in the energy market can point toward softness in the overall economy  Weekly U S  government crude stockpile data come out later Wednesday 
Speaking of data  the May consumer price index  CPI  came out early Wednesday and looked relatively benign  kind of like producer prices the previous day  May CPI rose 0 1   in line with Wall Street s expectations 
Core CPI  which strips out food and energy  also rose 0 1   a bit below the average analyst estimate  Neither of these data points would appear likely to stand in the way of a potential Fed rate cut  if that s what the Fed wants to do  The takeaway from this week s inflation data is that the price environment still isn t looking like something to worry about 
Volatility Hanging Around
It s a headline focused market  with the latest tweet or statement on tariffs likely to move stocks  That explains in part why volatility continues to hang in here  The CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  stayed above 16 early Wednesday  not too far off recent highs despite the market s comeback over the last week 
The 2900 mark continues to be a barrier for the S P 500 Index  SPX   An early run above that level on Tuesday met resistance  and stocks fell back  just as we saw on Monday  Meanwhile  10 year Treasury bond yields slipped slightly on Wednesday  pulling back to around 2 11  from highs of around 2 15  earlier this week 
It wouldn t be too surprising to see a little consolidation here  when you think about how the market s acted over the last week  Basically  stocks fell for six weeks  and then recovered about 70  of those losses in six days  It might be getting to the point where it s tough for some investors to commit capital when the market is within 1  or 2  of all time highs and a large piece of news  tariffs  continues to hang over everyone s head for longer than most had expected 
That could be making it difficult for some investors to say   Hey  I have to buy the market here   Maybe people are buying individual stocks  but perhaps not full sectors  Contrast that with a week ago  when 10 of 11 sectors were rising on the first two days of the rally 
Sector Picking Not So Simple
Compounding matters might be the fact that sectors themselves seem a bit more differentiated now than they were  say  a year ago  Back then many investors thought they could just buy FAANGs and be OK  but now the FAANGs have all gone off in different directions amid conflicting fundamental factors 
Or there was a time about a year and a half ago when the market was rising and the word on the Street was to just  Buy Tech   Now you re hearing analysts who say   Buy Tech  but we re not sure about the chip makers  
All this is can be a way to measure the strength of a rally  Are people buying sectors  or does it seem like just two or three individual stocks in a sector are doing well  It s an interesting distinction on rally days 
Another factor potentially helping keep things range bound is the Fed s meeting next week  As we get closer  volume might look a bit thin  with some traders holding back ahead of the Fed s decision  Most traders don t expect the Fed to lower rates next week  with a less than one in five chance of that  according to the futures market  Still  the Fed s statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell s press conference next Wednesday after the meeting are likely to get a very close look  We ll talk more about that in the coming days 
Banks Start Warning
Speaking of sectors that aren t performing in sync  consider Financials  Two of the biggest banks Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  and JP Morgan  NYSE JPM  were having good days Tuesday  even while Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  was flat and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  was struggling with issues of its own regarding CEO replacement 
MS was up despite its CFO saying at an industry conference Tuesday that he d be  surprised  if the company beat its Q1 numbers  Bloomberg reported  The last two weeks have been  very hard   MS s CFO said  There were warnings from MS and Citigroup  NYSE C  at the conference that trading has slowed down  according to Bloomberg 
What we might be seeing here is companies that know most of Wall Street expects them to have a bad quarter simply getting out the news ahead of time  It s no secret that falling interest rates have been tough on the Financial sector  so maybe we re seeing some gamesmanship  Banks could be saying   We know you don t expect much from us this quarter anyway  so let s put everything on the table  
It s pretty impressive how many bank CEOs are managing these tough times with expense cuts and new revenue sources  However  the interest rate situation could be a big blow to smaller regional banks  That s something we ll probably get a better picture of once earnings start 
Weakness in regional banks is one reason why the small cap Russell 2000  RUT  continues to lag its SPX and Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  cousins 
From a sector viewpoint  it was mostly a flat Tuesday  though Industrials fell nearly 1  after a Wall Street Journal article implied that Pentagon spending could fall 
It s been quiet on the earnings front this week  but athletic wear company Lululemon  NASDAQ LULU  reports after the close today and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  reports Thursday  LULU s stock has been on a run over the last 12 months  climbing about 40   Shares got a boost after the company s Q4 earnings report back in March  Still  it s been tough for many retailers lately  so LULU s earnings and call might help provide more insight into that market 
Looking ahead to data later this week  investors are gearing up for Friday morning s report on May retail sales  Analysts expect a solid 0 7  rise  according to Briefing com  compared with a 0 2  drop in April 
FIGURE 1  Figure 1  RATES DOWN  NO PROBLEM  Despite 10 year yields  purple line  dropping dramatically over the last month  the Financial sector  candlestick  has performed pretty well  That s especially true in the last week  Data Source  Cboe  S P Dow Jones Indices  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Could Yields Be Looking Up  It s probably too early to talk seriously about any sort of  bottom  in Treasury yields  especially with the benchmark 10 year yield still near 20 month lows at around 2 11   However  one analyst speaking on CNBC Tuesday pointed out what appears to be a  double bottom  in the 10 year yield chart earlier this month when yields fell to 2 07  one day and then 2 05  a few days later  They ve since bounced nearly 10 basis points from the low  This rise in yields might be one reason some of the so called  defensive  sectors  including Utilities  have come under pressure this week  Typically  Utilities do better when yields are low because investors often flock to dividend paying sectors at such times  Yields might also have already built in chances for a near term Fed rate cut  which have grown significantly over the last few weeks according to Fed funds futures 
Fed Funds Futures Say  Speaking of rate cut chances  they diminished slightly for next week s meeting after President Trump announced he d suspend plans to immediately slap tariffs on Mexico  Chances for a rate cut at next week s Fed meeting recently stood at 19   according to CME futures trading  down from highs above 25  at times last week  Chances for a 25 basis point cut in July are steady near 66   but the odds for two rate cuts between now and July something one analyst surprised many on Wall Street by predicting recently are only 14   according to the futures market  Last week s soft jobs number might give the Fed some additional cover if it wants to cut rates  and producer prices released Tuesday for May also looked mostly benign  Whatever the case  the futures market as it stands now is predicting a better than 75  chance that rates will be lower by the end of July than they are now 
Dollar Eases As Rate Cut Odds Increase  Recent weakness in the dollar index might reflect increased rate cut chances  with the dollar consistently trading under 97 lately after spending most of April and May above that level and even climbing to nearly two year highs north of 98 at times  Lower rates often weigh on the dollar because they tend to increase the risk of inflation  Another weight on the dollar right now could be the euro  which hit three month highs vs  the dollar earlier this month and remains near those levels at 1 13  That s still down from highs above 1 24 early last year  but shows a renewed energy in the euro  The euro seemed to perk up a little after the European Central Bank s  ECB  recent meeting where ECB President Mario Draghi said the ECB would consider lowering rates and renewing stimulus if the European economy continues to stumble  Hopes of a stimulus improving Europe s economy could be helping the euro  and that in turn might be weighing on the dollar 
While the dollar looks softer  its relative weakness might come too late to really give U S  multinationals much assistance during the three weeks left of Q2  The greenback s pop earlier this quarter potentially made U S  goods more expensive for overseas customers  which might hurt companies in the Industrial  Materials and Info Tech sectors that depend on exports for big chunks of revenue  Many U S  companies expressed concern about the strong dollar s impact in their Q1 conference calls  and it wouldn t be all that surprising to hear more of the same in Q2 earnings calls

What s Next for Broadcom Inc 
While Broadcom Inc  Has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

100523,322038,AVGO,ZTE stock surges as U S  supplier ban lifted though outlook remains uncertain,news,By Sijia Jiang HONG KONG  Reuters    Investors on Monday cheered the lifting of a U S  supplier ban on China s ZTE Corp  HK 0763   pushing its shares up 17 percent  though analysts cautioned the telecommunications equipment maker still faced many challenges as it works to revive its business  The U S  Commerce Department on Friday lifted a crippling ban on American firms selling parts to ZTE   imposed in relation to a U S  sanctions case   after the Chinese company deposited  400 million in escrow as part of a settlement reached last month  The settlement also included a  1 billion penalty paid to the U S  Treasury in June   It s a long way back for ZTE  Not just to win back customer confidence and assure them  but also work hard to find substitutes to U S  suppliers such as Avnet  Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  etc  to reduce reliance    said Nikhil Batra  senior research manager at consultancy IDC   Essentially  this would mean going back to the drawing board and rethinking its overall design strategy   ZTE s Hong Kong listed stock opened up 5 5 percent on Monday  rising over 17 percent to HK 16 12 by noon  That was still 37 percent lower than its last price in April when trading of the stock was suspended for two months following the ban  ZTE s Shenzhen shares jumped by their 10 percent daily limit early on Monday  as investors brushed off ZTE s forecast on Friday a net loss of up to 9 billion yuan   1 35 billion  for the first half of 2018 due to the fine  Jefferies analyst Edison Lee estimated ZTE had an operating loss of up to 4 billion yuan for April June due to suspending business when the ban was imposed  Lee said he expected ZTE to go to each of its non Chinese telecommunications customers  and offer incentives of varying degrees to compensate for their hardship and reward their patience and loyalty   People familiar with the matter told Reuters that ZTE started reaching out to clients over the weekend with a letter promising to ramp up operations as quickly as possible  Many U S  lawmakers see ZTE as a national security threat and  on Thursday  a group of Republican and Democratic U S  senators urged ZTE s penalties be reinstated  The U S  Senate paved the way for a showdown with U S  President Donald Trump over the issue last month  when it passed an annual defense policy bill with an amendment that could reverse ZTE s settlement  The fate of the amendment remains unclear as the Senate and House have yet to reconcile their different versions  There is bipartisan support for the measure among members of Congress  but Republicans control both the Senate and House and party leaders rarely break from Trump s policies   The political nature of the issue and the fact that members of the U S  Senate are not on board this decision makes it very tricky  Anything could happen   said Batra  Others agreed the prospect of ZTE continuing as before was unlikely    In terms of carrier business  we think ZTE is still a competitive telecom equipment supplier  especially in the 5G era  and its return to business may help China s 5G development to be back on track   Nomura analysts wrote in a note to clients on Monday   However  we think it remains uncertain as to what extent ZTE can win back the existing customers and explore new businesses   The ban had been a source of friction between the U S  and Chinese governments at a time of escalating trade tension  The ban was imposed in April after Commerce Department officials said ZTE made false statements about disciplining 35 employees after it pleaded guilty last year to violating U S  sanctions by illegally shipping U S  goods and technology to Iran  Uncertainty over the ban battered ZTE shares  wiping nearly  11 billion from the company s market valuation  As part of the deal to lift the ban  ZTE agreed to remove all members of its leadership at or above senior vice president level  along with any executives associated with the wrongdoing within 30 days ,2018-07-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ztes-hk-shares-set-to-open-up-55-percent-after-us-lifts-supplier-ban-1530427,1530427
100524,322039,AVGO,U S  Scrutinizes China s HNA Over Building Near Trump Tower,news," Bloomberg     China s HNA Group Co   HK 0521  said it s been questioned by the U S  government s investment review panel over its ownership of a building in Manhattan near Trump Tower 
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U S   which assesses deals posing potential national security risks  raised concerns about some  unique facts and circumstances  regarding the location of the building  a representative for the Chinese company said in a statement  Those issues didn t exist when HNA bought the 850 Third Avenue property  according to the statement 
The 21 story building houses one of only two police precincts that are within a mile of Trump Tower  the president s base when he s in New York  HNA said it s taking steps to address concerns voiced by the committee  without providing further detail 
HNA also denied a New York Post report that President Donald Trump s administration is poised to seize a majority stake in the building  which the debt saddled company has been looking to unload   There is no seizure or forced sale of 850 Third Avenue underway or pending  and it is grossly inaccurate and misleading to suggest otherwise   it said 
Trade War
The scrutiny comes amid rising tensions between the U S  and China s government  which is said to have decided to help HNA pull itself out of recent liquidity challenges  The Chinese conglomerate  which has sold more than  17 billion in assets to reduce its massive debt load  has been marketing the Manhattan building among several properties it is considering selling 
Trump has been zeroing in on Chinese investment in the U S  amid his escalating trade war with the world s second largest economy 
The increased attention has seen some high profile deals scuppered  such as Chinese billionaire Jack Ma s attempt to buy Dallas based payment provider MoneyGram International  Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Ltd  s  117 billion attempt to buy California s Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc     which would have been the largest tech deal in history    was shot down on concerns the merger would benefit China s emerging telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co 
Plans to bolster CFIUS s powers may mean more deals get into trouble  The body s reach may be expanded under a bill that Congress is expected to pass in August 
This isn t the first time HNA has crossed CFIUS s radar  In late April  it abandoned plans to buy SkyBridge Capital from former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci after waiting months for approval from the body  The group has also faced heightened scrutiny across its holdings worldwide  partly because of questions about its ownership 
HNA agreed to buy the 850 Third Avenue building before Trump was elected  The company has become a poster child for a swathe of Chinese acquirers that sought out high profile deals around the world before the government started reining them in last year amid concern about unsustainable corporate debt levels

automotive and industrial verticals Notably  Infineon stock has declined 8 1  year to date  against the  s rally of 6 3  Acquisition Facets in DetailInfineon is a Germany based company  while Cypress is headquartered in San Jose  CA  The semiconductor stocks in general are bearing the brunt of ongoing U S  China trade war and weakness in macroeconomic conditions Although  relationship metrics between the United States and China differ from that of the United States and Europe  uncertainty prevails over the approval of the deal given growing U S  protectionism Denial of Broadcom s   NASDAQ AVGO   Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   is noteworthy in this regard  Notably  the now U S  based Broadcom was headquartered in Singapore  The acquisition is subject to Cypress  shareholders nod and other customary regulatory approvals  Nevertheless  after fulfilling the regulatory approvals  Infineon anticipates closure by end of 2019 or early 2020 Analyzing Cash   Debt PositionInfineon ended the  quarter of fiscal 2019 with  809 million in cash   cash equivalents  Total debt  including current portion  as on Mar 31  2019  was  1 549 billion Meanwhile  Cypress reported cash and cash equivalents of  285 1 million and long term debt  including current portion  of  904 3 million at the end of first quarter 2019 It is important to note that Cypress will fulfill its quarterly dividend payment commitments up to the closure of the deal  The company will pay 11 cents per share as dividends on Jul 18  2019 to shareholders as on Jun 27  2019 Markedly  both the acquirer and the to be acquired companies are in a net debt position  which is not financially favorable  at least in the near term  However  given the long term growth prospects  we anticipate the deal to yield higher returns for shareholders on bottom line expansion Infineon notes that the financial backing for the deal is completely  underwritten by a consortium of banks   In a bid to sustain liquidity  the company will fund the acquisition through 30  of total contract value by equity  and remaining via debt and cash on hand Complementary Business Lines to Alleviate Macro WoesInfineon is expected to accentuate its growth prospects of its Automotive  ATV  Industrial Power Control  IPC  and Power Management   Multimarket  PMM  operating segments with the acquisition Cypress  expertise in connectivity components and microcontrollers is expected to complement Infineon s proficiency in power semiconductors  security solutions and sensors Moreover  Infineon expects to explore new IoT applications pertaining to consumer and industrial verticals on the back of Cypress  domain expertise in software The aforementioned factors are expected to aid Infineon in expanding TAM effectively  Following the buyout  the German chipmaker envisions the acquisition to be accretive to earnings as early as its  first full fiscal year  The company anticipates the economies of scale from the buyout to  create cost synergies of  180 million per annum by 2022  Infineon estimates the top line to increase by approximately  1 5 billion per annum over the long term  In terms of revenues  Infineon anticipates the deal to position it as the eighth largest chip manufacturing company globally  Per its target operating model  Infineon envisions revenues to grow by 9  and now aims segment result margin of 19   prior estimate of 17   Interestingly  trade war has made it difficult for U S  based semiconductor companies to do business with companies based in China  We believe that if the deal finalizes  it will somewhat cushion Cypress  business from the ongoing tariff scenario Moreover  Cypress  products will have a broader reach  This way  the deal presents a win win situation for both the companies Wrapping UpWe anticipate Cypress  addition to Infineon s portfolio to aid the acquirer improve fortunes amid ongoing macroeconomic weakness Further  the deal marks prevalent consolidation in

100527,322042,AVGO,Broadcom Inc   AVGO  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on June 13  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  5 17 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 9  
Revenues are expected to be  5 66 billion  up 13  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Broadcom Inc 
For Broadcom Inc The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Broadcom Inc  Will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Broadcom Inc  Would post earnings of  5 19 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 55  delivering a surprise of  6 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Broadcom Inc  Doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-06-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/broadcom-inc-avgo-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200429181,200429181
100528,322043,AVGO,3 Stocks To Watch This Week  Broadcom  Lululemon  United Technologies,opinion,"Bulls appear to be winning again  The U S  stock market  after coming under pressure from the U S  China trade standoff  is regaining some momentum on hopes that the U S  Federal Reserve is readying a possible rate cut to help avoid a recession if the trade war lingers and starts hurting the economy 
That positive development  coupled with the U S  and Mexico agreeing to an immigration deal  may also add to the positive sentiment this week  President Trump announced late Friday that he wouldn t impose tariffs on goods from Mexico   rising incrementally from 5  to 25  over time   after the country agreed to take a tougher stance on immigration 
For investors who want to focus on company specific developments  here are our top three stocks 
1  Broadcom
The last chipmaker to report during this earnings season  Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  is worth watching amid the China trade uncertainties  The company reports Q2 2019 numbers on Thursday  June 13  after the close  Consensus calls for  5 21 EPS on  5 69B in revenue 
With the majority of semiconductor companies exposed to the U S  China trade war  there s s a good chance that Broadcom will cut its earnings forecast for the remaining part of the year  Analysts are warning that the latest downturn in the industry will be prolonged and more painful 
The combination of 25  tariffs on Chinese goods  the U S  blacklisting Huawei Technologies and China s consequent retaliation  may freeze the industry supply chain  hurting companies like Broadcom  But despite the latest downturn in the semiconductor industry  Broadcom is one chip stock we like due to its diversified product lines and its highly attractive dividend yield of 4 1  

These two strengths will help Broadcom weather the storm and rebound quickly if the U S  and China reach a deal on trade  Its shares  which closed on Friday at  274 87  are up about 4  over the past three months 
2  Lululemon
The athletic apparel retailer  Lululemon Athletica  NASDAQ LULU  reports its quarterly earnings Wednesday  June 12  after the bell  The market consensus is for  0 7 a share profit and  756 million in revenue 
There is hardly anything about this the maker of upscale yoga wear that investors can complain about this year  It s got a great product mix which is resonating well with customers  improving store visits and same store sales  Lululemon s investments to improve its e commerce channels are also paying off  as its online penetration reached 26   with some analysts  including Cowen  Inc   calling management s execution  near flawless  and Morgan Stanley which said the company was  firing on all cylinders  

Shares also reflect this upbeat outlook  rising 43  this year  massively outperforming the S P 500  They closed at  172 49 on Friday  near the 52 week high  The stock had surged 16  when the company topped the Q4 earnings forecasts in March 
3  United Technologies
United Technologies  NYSE UTX  and Raytheon  NYSE RTN  are in talks about merging their operations in a deal that would create an aerospace and defense industry giant  according to media reports over the weekend 
The all stock transaction could be announced in the coming days  according to the Wall Street Journal  United Technologies has a market valuation of about  114 billion  while Raytheon is valued at about  52 billion 
A deal with Raytheon would extend the transformation of United Technologies under Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes  who is already planning to spin off the company s Carrier climate controls and Otis elevator operations  Said Douglas Rothacker  an aerospace autos analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence 

 Combining United Technologies  aerospace business  which is expected to generate  50 billion in revenue in 2020  and Raytheon s  30 billion would create the second biggest western aerospace defense company  

It s not clear  however  how the market will absorb this news and the challenges that will come with the combined entities  especially when there is so much on the plate for Hayes who is in the middle of the company restructuring

Prior to today s trading  shares of the chipmaker had lost 20 08  over the past month  This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector s loss of 7 49  and the S P 500 s loss of 4 53  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from AVGO as it approaches its next earnings report date  This is expected to be June 13  2019  On that day  AVGO is projected to report earnings of  5 17 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 5 94   Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  5 66 billion  up 12 95  from the year ago period 
AVGO s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  23 11 per share and revenue of  24 40 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  11  and  17 06   respectively 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for AVGO  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system

The United States in recent years has blocked many proposed Chinese investments in American companies in an effort to stop China from acquiring important technologies  making this approval a rare win 
The deal had been stalled over concerns by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  about Chinese access to sensitive U S  personal data  CFIUS has become increasingly skeptical of high tech deals involving China in particular and has blocked transactions that would have given it access to sophisticated semiconductors or data of American citizens 
CFIUS has gone from virtually unknown several years ago to front page news in March as one of its probes resulted in Trump forbidding chipmaker Broadcom Inc  O AVGO   which was in the process of moving back to the United States  from buying rival  Qualcomm Inc   O QCOM  
Oceanwide agreed in October 2016 to pay  2 7 billion in cash  or  5 43 per share  to acquire Genworth  Genworth currently trades at  3 81 per share

Treasury yields pare last week s gains  potentially bottoming out   but later reverse on risk off shift
WTI climbs on OPEC signals of continued supply cuts
Key Events
Europe s STOXX 600 and futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 took a beating this morning as weekend reports that Alphabet s Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  halted business with Huawei including transfer of hardware  software and key technical services finally took hold of the market  crushing tech shares 
U S  contracts had initially pared losses after last week s sharp decline  helped by the beneficial price effect of the White House s move to lift metal tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports 
However  the rebound proved short lived compared with the ramifications of last week s ban on Chinese telecom company Huawei  as other U S  tech companies such as Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  joined Alphabet in stopping all shipping from the Chinese smart phone giant 
Earlier  in the Asian session  regional indices closed well off their lows  as investors registered the likely election wins of conservative incumbent parties in Australia and India  India s Nifty 50 leaped 3 60   only a few inches away from its record closing price posted on April 16 
Hong Kong s Hang Seng underperformed  dropping 0 57  to the lowest level since Jan  30  nearing its 200 DMA 

China s Shanghai Composite closed 0 41  lower  limiting the damage of a 1 51  intraday plunge  Technically  however  Chinese bulls are expected to get slaughtered as the price develops a rising  bearish flag  after topping out  Today s rebound was favored by the dual support of the 100 DMA on the bottom of the flag  Below lies in wait the 200 DMA  If prices fall below that  as the current pattern suggests  investors can expected to experience more pain 

Meanwhile  the yield on 10 year Treasurys climbed for the third session out of four since touching the 2 350  level  We can call a bottom if it scaled above the 2 62  level  completing a double bottom 
Overall  if yields bottom out  they will also complete a massive falling  bullish wedge demonstrating that all Treasury buyers have been pushed out  driving yields higher  and that the long term uptrend since mid 2016 will resume after a medium term interruption this year  However  until that happens  we remain bullish on bonds and defensive on equities 
Meanwhile  the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development slashed its economic forecasts  warning against the visible effects of a protracted U S  China trade dispute 
A slew of U S  data this week  from home sales to manufacturing may offer clues on the economy s robustness against these trade headwinds  No doubt the Fed  which releases minutes from its last monetary policy meeting on Wednesday  will monitor the next batch of data closely to fine tune its interest rate approach 
The Dollar Index pared gains after climbing every single day last week  Technically  the slide marks a pullback after the greenback completed an ascending triangle  demonstrating demand is progressively absorbing supply 

The euro managed to crawl into the green after edging lower  remaining under pressure ahead of European Parliament elections  which are expected to hand more power to Eurosceptic populist parties  The common currency is hovering only 0 2  above the lowest level since June 2017  Meanwhile  it trades within a descending channel of a pair of parallel trendlines demarking the respective territories of bears and bulls 
China s offshore yuan strengthened to the highest level since Nov  20  posting some relief after trade turmoil dragged down the currency to a five month low 

Conversely  the yen slipped as economic data showing unexpected growth in Japan came with reasons for caution  masking a drop in imports  Technically  the price is forming an intraday shooting star below the 50 DMA  suggesting the price might fall again below the neckline of a potential double top 

Elsewhere  crude climbed after Saudi Arabia and other key OPEC producers signaled their intention to keep oil supplies constrained for the rest of the year  while pledging to prevent any risk of shortage  Technically  the WTI price gave up its intraday highs  forming a shooting star which would only be confirmed by a closing price and pointing at the resistance of its prior uptrend line since the December bottom  For now  the May 13 highs are providing a support  The black gold provided a positive signal last week when it triggered a golden cross  when the 50 DMA crossed over the 200 DMA

100612,322127,AVGO,Qualcomm to refile China antitrust application for  44 billion NXP takeover  sources,news,"By Matthew Miller
BEIJING  Reuters    U S  chipmaker Qualcomm  O QCOM  will refile as early as Monday an application with the Chinese government to clear its  44 billion takeover of  NXP Semiconductors   O NXPI   sources said  giving regulators more time to decide on the deal and averting a collapse 
The San Diego based firm withdrew its earlier antitrust application on Saturday at the request of China s commerce ministry  just days before the regulator s April 17 deadline to decide on the transaction expires  the sources said 
Clinching the NXP takeover  the world s biggest in the semiconductor sector  is crucial to Qualcomm  which is seeking to diversify its customer base and become the leading chip supplier to the fast growing automotive market 
The U S  chipmaker has already received approval from eight of nine required global regulators to finalize the acquisition  with Chinese clearance the only one pending 
By refiling  Qualcomm will provide the Ministry of Commerce  Mofcom  potentially with another six month window to review its application  It will be the second time Qualcomm would be refiling its antitrust application with Mofcom 
Analysts  however  said a decision by Mofcom on the deal is unlikely to come before trade and investment tensions between China and the United States are resolved 
 Qualcomm is going to have to wait for Washington and Beijing to resolve their differences before this deal is going to move forward   said Erick Robinson  director of patent litigation and licensing at Beijing East IP 
Earlier this month  the administration of U S  President Donald Trump proposed  50 billion worth of tariffs on some 1 300 industrial  technology  transport and medical products to force changes in Beijing s intellectual property practices 
Beijing immediately responded with a list of proposed duties of  50 billion on key American imports 
China s isn t blocking the deal   but they are holding it hostage   said Andrew Gilholm  director of analysis for China and North Asia at risk consultancy Control Risks  adding he had heard about Qualcomm s application withdrawal and planned refiling 
Qualcomm was facing the  perfect storm  for a U S  company in China  he added   It s at the heart of everything  there s a national security angle  there s a competitive and Chinese industrial policy angle   so it s caught up in all the trade war stuff  
Qualcomm declined to comment  Mofcom didn t immediately respond to a request for comment 
Antitrust concerns were believed to have been raised during the most recent round of discussions  but Qualcomm s position was these were unfounded and not related to the deal  the sources said 
Qualcomm is understood to have offered a series of guarantees to Mofcom to assure that NXP customers wouldn t need to also purchase Qualcomm licenses 
The U S  chipmaker  which initially announced its bid for the Dutch semiconductor company in October 2016  said in February that it was raising its bid to  127 50 per share  valuing NXP at  44 billion 
That sweetener came weeks before Trump  citing national security  ordered rival Broadcom Ltd  O AVGO  to halt its proposed  117 billion buyout of Qualcomm

100616,322131,AVGO,Optimism growing that U S  foreign investment bill will pass  official,news,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Negotiators working to revise a bill before Congress that would tighten scrutiny of foreign investment in order to limit Chinese efforts to acquire sophisticated U S  technology are optimistic the measure will be signed into law by the end of the year  a senior U S  Treasury official said on Thursday 
The bill in the Senate and a companion measure in the U S  House of Representatives would broaden the reach of the inter agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   which currently looks at foreign acquisitions of U S  companies or stock transactions that may hurt national security 
 I m optimistic that it will be completed during this year if not by August   the official said  The bipartisan legislation has the support of President Donald Trump s administration 
CFIUS has gone from virtually unknown several years ago to front page news this year as one of its probes resulted in President Donald Trump s forbidding Singapore based chipmaker Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Inc from buying rival Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc 
Tightening the CFIUS process is one of several efforts supported by the Trump administration  including tariffs on steel and aluminum  to establish a more protectionist stance in an effort to tamp down Chinese imports while raising the regulatory bar on what deals get approved 
Negotiators in the administration  on Capitol Hill and working for the investment and high tech community are on their fourth version of a bill on CFIUS  The bill previously underwent at least one proposed revision that would seek to narrow its scope 
The initial draft of the bill could have expanded CFIUS oversight to anything sold by a  critical technology company   a term meaning technology with military importance  Tech companies criticized that version on concerns that it would limit or slow their own exports  A revision trimmed the oversight language to  critical technology   in hopes of preventing CFIUS from being flooded with applications related to older technology ",2018-04-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/optimism-growing-that-us-foreign-investment-bill-will-pass-official-1417743,1417743

100652,322167,AVGO,U S  Said to Weigh Use of Emergency Law to Curb China Takeovers,news," Bloomberg     The Trump administration is considering a crackdown on Chinese investments in technologies the U S  considers sensitive by employing a law reserved for national emergencies  among other options  according to people familiar with the matter 
Treasury Department officials are working on plans to identify technology sectors in which Chinese companies would be banned from investing  such as semiconductors and so called 5G wireless communications  according to four people with knowledge of the proposal  who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
The investment curbs would be the latest step in President Donald Trump s plan to punish China for what the U S  sees as violations of American intellectual property rights  The president asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to consider investment restrictions on Chinese firms after the administration released the results of its probe into China s IP practices last week 
While investors have so far focused on Trump s plan to impose tariffs on Chinese imports  new restrictions could deepen a slowdown in Chinese investments in the U S  since Trump took office  hurting the ability of American companies to raise capital and holding down valuations 
 Other Action 
 There will be limitations on foreign investment   Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Tuesday in an interview on Fox Business Network  Pending legislation in the Senate and House to bulk up the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U S   the panel that currently reviews foreign takeovers  will be part of the response  Ross said  adding that Trump will take  other action  
The president rejected Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Ltd  s hostile takeover of Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  earlier this month  sending a message that his administration won t look kindly on any deal that would give China an edge in critical technology  Although Broadcom is based in Singapore  China loomed large in the decision  because Qualcomm is locked in a race with China s Huawei Technologies Co  to dominate the development of next generation wireless technology 
Last year  Trump blocked the takeover of chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor Corp  by a private equity firm backed by a Chinese state owned asset manager 
 Deemed Important 
Trump gave Mnuchin 60 days from March 22 to propose executive actions the president can take to address concerns about Chinese investments in industries or technologies  deemed important  to the U S 
Treasury officials are looking at ways to impose tougher conditions on Chinese firms using legislation that underlies CFIUS  which currently vets foreign takeovers on a case by case basis  But they are also weighing the use of a law that enables the president to regulate commerce in a national emergency  according to two of the people 
The International Emergency Economic Powers Act  enacted in 1977  allows the president to declare a national emergency in response to an  unusual and extraordinary threat   After declaring such an emergency  the president can block transactions and seize assets 
 It s never been used in connection with unfair trade practices  but it s broad enough that you could put restrictions on a wide variety of transactions   said Christian Davis  an international trade lawyer at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer   Feld LLP in Washington 
Strict Reciprocity
The Trump administration is considering enforcing strict reciprocity on Chinese acquisitions  meaning U S  regulators would only approve deals in sectors in which American companies are allowed to invest  according to two of the people familiar with the matter  China restricts or bans foreign investment in a range of industries  from car manufacturing to telecoms providers and rare earth exploration 
The Trump administration hasn t finalized its plans  and the options under consideration could still change  the people familiar with the matter cautioned 
Enforcing sweeping bans on Chinese investment would mark a major departure from the existing CFIUS process  which reviews individual transactions to determine if it threatens U S  national security  The administration could use CFIUS legislation to declare a policy that Chinese investment won t be allowed in entire industries deemed sensitive  such as microchips and telecommunications  said Davis  the Akin Gump lawyer 
 The question is how different is that from what CFIUS is doing already with respect to Chinese investments in sensitive sectors  Depending on how these restrictions are implemented  the answer may be not much   he said 
Republican Senator John Cornyn and Republican House member Robert Pittenger have introduced legislation that would expand the power of CFIUS to review foreign investments  Mnuchin has been supportive of the bill  which would broaden the scope of reviewable technologies to include investments in  critical  technologies

100661,322176,AVGO,Risk On Returns With A Bang As The S P 500 Approaches All Time High,opinion,"This post was written exclusively for Investing com
As stocks extend their spectacular first quarter run into Q2  the Christmas Eve rout appears to be long forgotten  Clearly  risk on is back  at least for a while 
If this trend continues  equities could climb even further in the coming months  as low interest rates prompt investors to go further out on the risk spectrum to find returns  Indeed  share prices are picking up right where they left off at the end of the last quarter  Less than two weeks into Q2  the S P 500 has already risen 2   adding to its 13  gain in Q1 and fast approaching its Sept  21 all time high of 2940 91 
Semiconductor stocks have surged over 5  through April 11 as measured by the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF  NYSE SMH   while the Communications Services Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLC  has jumped by almost 4   along with the Material Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLB  which has gained 3 3   All three sectors are risk on groups comprising companies that would greatly benefit from a recovering global economy 
The rotation taking place in the second quarter has probably been prompted by the Federal Reserve s indication it may be moving to the sidelines for 2019  That has caused interest rates across the U S  yield curve to plunge  in turn sending investors starved for returns to the sectors and stocks that might provide the best opportunities 
Broad Based Rally In Semis
What may be even more impressive is just how broad based the rallies in these groups have been  Of the top 25 holdings that make up the Semiconductor ETF  24 are higher as of April 11  This suggests that investors are buying the group across the board and it s not just one or two stocks leading the sector higher 
The group s strong performance can largely be tied to what many investors are beginning to believe is a bottom in the semiconductor cycle  Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  noted the cycle was bottoming in its quarterly results at the beginning of March  while a Digitimes report noted that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  NYSE TSM  is beginning to see a pick up in orders in 7nm chips 

Materials  Communications Sectors Surge
Material stocks have also seen the same broad based buying as semiconductors  with 23 of the top 25 stocks that make up that sector s ETF all advancing too  Communication stocks have also risen sharply  with buying across the sector  also with 23 of its top holdings gaining  This is a group that may see massive consolidation  with more entertainment providers searching for content as new streaming platforms come to market 
Technology  Consumer Sectors Not Far Behind
The technology sector is close behind  with its ETF  the Technology Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLK  and Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLY  both up over 3  this quarter and racing to new all time highs  Again  all five sectors together are pointing to what seems to be an increased appetite for added risk among investors 
Defensive Sectors Plunge
The two worst performing sectors so far this quarter have been the Health Care Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLV  and the Utilities Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLU   The health care ETF has plunged by around 1 25  this quarter  while the utilities ETF has dropped around 50 basis points  Additionally  the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLP  has fallen about 20 basis points  These sectors are primarily defensive  offering higher dividend yields and payments  along with lower volatility levels  They are primarily a risk off group  areas that investors flock to when seeking safety 

Treasury yields have plunged along with the defensive sectors  adding strength to the thesis that risk appetites have grown substantially  If the current trends continue  it would suggest that the S P 500 still has much further to rise  because the only places investors will find the opportunities for big returns will be in stocks meaning risk on is back and in a big way ",2019-04-12,Michael Kramer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/risk-on-is-back-as-stocks-approach-alltime-high-200405778,200405778

100712,322227,AVGO,Broadcom to end bid for Qualcomm  keeps plan to move to U S   sources,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B  Baker
 Reuters    Singapore based Broadcom Ltd  O AVGO  is planning to scrap its bid for  Qualcomm Inc   O QCOM   after U S  President Donald Trump blocked the chipmaker s proposed acquisition on national security grounds earlier this week  although it will press on with its plan to move its base to the United States  according to sources familiar with the matter 
Broadcom s board was meeting on Tuesday night to formalize its plans and it could make an announcement as soon as Wednesday  the two sources added  The company will also drop its challenge to Qualcomm s board  the people added 
Broadcom will continue with its plan to redomicile to the United States  a move that will cost it about  500 million a year under a higher tax rate  the sources added 
Being based in the United States as opposed to Singapore will allow Broadcom to make what it believes will be acquisitions of U S  companies that will not fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   which scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns 
Broadcom and Qualcomm could not be immediately reached for comment 
DEAD DEAL
Trump signed an order late on Monday to halt what would have been the biggest ever technology deal on concerns that a takeover of Qualcomm by the Singapore based company would erode the United States  lead in mobile technology and give China the upper hand 
The deal  spearheaded by CEO Hock Tan  would have created the world s No  3 semiconductor company with a leading market share in smartphones  car electronics and industrial internet devices 
Analysts said Broadcom can still build heft through smaller deals  And it could have an easier time buying U S  targets if it goes through with plans to redomicilie in the United States 
Tan has already turned Avago  a small chipmaker with a market value of  3 5 billion in 2009  into a more than  100 billion company 
Tan bought California based companies Broadcom for  37 billion in a leveraged deal in 2015 and Brocade Communications in a  5 5 billion deal two years later 
San Diego based Qualcomm evolved from a U S  military aerospace contractor to become the dominant player in wireless radio technology over the past two decades  with its chips used in half of all smartphones 
It fended off antitrust concerns around the globe over its intellectual property strategies  taking the biggest share of wireless royalties in the 3G and 4G eras and getting a head start on next decade s 5G era  which promises to embed wireless connections in cars  factories  homes and cities 
SMALLER BITES
Broadcom now has ample firepower for smaller deals  with about  11 billion in cash and the potential to generate nearly  9 billion in annual free cash flow  analysts estimate 
CFIUS  which raised concerns about the Qualcomm deal with Trump  listed the highly leveraged nature of Broadcom s bid for its larger rival as a major concern coupled with the risk of the U S  losing mobile technology leadership 
Broadcom had planned since last year to relocate its legal headquarters to the United States  avoiding the need for a CFIUS review 
 If Broadcom completes its redomiciling in the U S  in a way that extinguishes any non U S  ownership or control  then I think they can open the door to many  if not all  acquisitions     they would effectively no longer be subject to a CFIUS initiated review or investigation   said Guillermo Christensen  a lawyer who works on CFIUS issues at Brown Rudnick in Washington 
 But that really hinges on completely severing the foreign ownership connection   he said ",2018-03-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/broadcoms-ambitious-chief-will-shift-target-after-qualcomm-halt-analysts-1338916,1338916
100713,322228,AVGO,Broadcom ends bid for Qualcomm after President Trump nixes deal,news," Reuters    Singapore based Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Ltd withdrew its  117 billion bid to acquire Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc on Wednesday  two days after U S  President Donald Trump blocked the attempt citing national security concerns 
The company said it has also withdrawn its slate of independent director nominees for Qualcomm s annual shareholder meeting 
Broadcom  however  expects to continue with its plan to redomicile to the United States 
 Although we are disappointed with this outcome  Broadcom will comply with the order   the chipmaker said 
Sources had told Reuters on Tuesday that Broadcom was ready to scrap its bid for Qualcomm 
Broadcom s board met late on Tuesday to formalize plans to move its base to the United States  at a cost of about  500 million a year under a higher tax rate  the sources said 
Being based in the United States as opposed to Singapore should make it easier for Broadcom to make acquisitions of U S  companies without falling under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  
Shares of Broadcom were untraded  while those of Qualcomm were up marginally before the opening bell ",2018-03-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/broadcom-ends-bid-for-qualcomm-1340849,1340849
100714,322229,AVGO,What is 5G and who are the major players ,news,By Eric Auchard and Stephen Nellis LONDON SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump has blocked microchip maker Broadcom Ltd s  O AVGO   117 billion takeover of rival Qualcomm  O QCOM  amid concerns that it would give China the upper hand in the next generation of mobile communications  or 5G  Below are some facts about 5G and major players  WHAT IS 5G  5G networks  now in the final testing stage  will rely on denser arrays of small antennas and the cloud to offer data speeds up to 50 or 100 times faster than current 4G networks and serve as critical infrastructure for a range of industries  Deals to start building mass market 5G networks are still largely a year away  but by 2025  1 2 billion people are set to have access to 5G networks   a third of them in China  according to the global wireless trade group GSMA  Moving to new networks promises to enable new mobile services and even whole new business models  but could pose challenges for countries and industries unprepared to invest in the transition  Unlike the upgrades of cellular standards 2G in the early 1990s  3G around the millennium and 4G in 2010  5G standards will deliver not just faster phone and computer data but also help connect up cars  machines  cargo and crop equipment  WHY IS THE U S  WORRIED  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   which vets acquisitions of U S  corporations by foreign companies  said the Broadcom takeover risked weakening Qualcomm  which would boost China over the United States in the 5G race  Acquiring Qualcomm would represent the jewel in the crown of Broadcom s portfolio of communications chips  which supply wi fi  power management  video and other features in smartphones alongside Qualcomm s core baseband chips   radio modems that wirelessly connect phones to networks  The concern is that a takeover by Singapore based Broadcom could see the firm cut research and development spending by Qualcomm or hive off strategically important parts of the company to other buyers  including in China  U S  officials and analysts have said  5G promises to open up the clubby world of telecom equipment by creating openings for a far wider range of players in hardware  software and semiconductors  many of them from Asia  increasing the dependence of Silicon Valley on foreign players  MAJOR PLAYERS Before the new technology becomes a reality for consumers  two transitions need to take place  Mobile operators have to upgrade their networks with 5G gear made by the likes of Huawei  HWT UL  and ZTE  0000630 SZ  of China  Sweden s Ericsson  ST ERICb  and Finland s Nokia  HE NOKIA   And phone makers need to make handsets with built in 5G radios ready to hook up to networks   Qualcomm  O QCOM  is the dominant player in smartphone communications chips  making half of all core baseband radio chips in smartphones  It is one of the last big U S  technology companies with a major role in mobile communications hardware   Most other baseband chips come from Asia  MediaTek  TW 2454  of Taiwan holds about one quarter of the market  while Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  and Huawei  HWT UL    two big smartphone makers   develop chips for their own devices  Huawei does through a subsidiary known as HiSilicon   Its dominant position in 5G comes from its mastery of two areas  getting its patents adopted in what are known as standards and then selling the chip designs that work with those standards  The standards are set by a global body to ensure all phones work across different mobile networks  and whoever s essential patents end up making it into the standard stands to reap huge royalty licensing revenue streams  Qualcomm has landed a number of these foundational patents  which means that both handset makers and telecommunications gear makers will have to pay it licensing fees  It dominated standards setting in 3G and 4G wireless and looks set to top the list of patent holders heading into the 5G cycle  Huawei  Nokia  Ericsson and others are also vying to amass 5G patents  which has helped spur complex cross licensing agreements like the deal struck late last year Nokia and Huawei around handsets ,2018-03-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/what-is-5g-and-who-are-the-major-players-1343144,1343144
100715,322230,AVGO, King Dollar  Kudlow Fighting Tide of Bearish Greenback Wagers,news," Bloomberg     The Trump administration might have gained a strong dollar advocate in Larry Kudlow  but the incoming White House economic adviser faces an uphill battle in stopping the greenback s slide 
Former CNBC contributor Kudlow took to the network minutes after his appointment was announced Wednesday to endorse a higher dollar  saying that he would like to see the currency  a wee bit stronger   Kudlow  70  went so far as to make a trade recommendation   I would buy King Dollar and I would sell gold  
Kudlow might end up as another disappointed dollar bull  The consensus bet in markets is for a softer greenback  as seen in speculator positioning and inflows into unhedged foreign currency exchange traded funds  And faced with escalating trade tensions and a widening U S  current account deficit  even Kudlow s vocal support likely won t provide a lasting boost to the currency  according to Alvise Marino  a foreign exchange strategist at  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  Group AG 
 Kudlow speaks about the strong dollar and says all the right things in terms of what markets want to hear  but at the same time  you have much wider fiscal funding requirements   Marino said   There s so many more headwinds and they re much more significant  
Perhaps most prominent among those headwinds is the U S  current account shortfall  Trump s shoot down of Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Ltd  s takeover bid for Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  likely also sends a  somewhat hostile message  to overseas investors  which will further undermine the U S  s ability to fund the gap  according to Marino 
The dollar has slumped 2 7 percent to start the year  building upon an 8 5 percent loss in 2017  Bearish wagers on the currency outnumber bets on gains by 149 000 contracts  according to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  Distaste for the dollar is evident in ETF flows as well  with investors increasingly rotating out of hedged funds in favor of European and Japanese stocks without currency protection 
Also limiting the greenback s upside in the wake of Kudlow s jawboning might be the new adviser s relative lack of clout  Marino said  Unlike U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  who sent the dollar tumbling in January with his praise of a weaker greenback  Kudlow isn t in a role that gives him any purview over the U S  currency 
 He s not in the Federal Reserve  He s an adviser to the president   Marino said   He might influence things  but what we ve seen in the last few days is a track record of very impulsive decisions that aren t based on careful reasoning of the economic pros and cons  ",2018-03-15,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/king-dollar-kudlow-fighting-tide-of-bearish-greenback-wagers-1343851,1343851
100716,322231,AVGO,Broadcom  AVGO  To Report Q1 Earnings  What s In The Offing ,opinion,Broadcom Limited   NASDAQ AVGO   is slated to release first quarter fiscal 2019 results on Mar 14 Notably  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  recording average positive surprise of 2 96  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered stellar non GAAP earnings of  5 85 per share marginally beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 58 per share  The figure alos improved 27 5  from the year ago quarter and 17 5  sequentially Non GAAP revenues from continuing operations were  5 448 billion  soaring 124  from the year ago quarter and 8  sequentially  GAAP revenues came in at  5 444 billion  The figure marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 401 Guidance   EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the current quarter is pegged at  5 20 per share  up 1 6  year over year  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  5 82 billion  up 9 3  year over year For fiscal 2019  Broadcom forecasts non GAAP revenues of almost  24 5 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  24 39 billion Notably  shares of Broadcom have returned 3 9  in the year to date period  underperforming the  s rally of 8 1  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderBroadcom recently introduced a couple of storage area network   SAN   based management software platforms  namely Brocade SANnav Global View and Brocade SANnav Management Portal  With the new offerings  now available   Broadcom attempts to simplify operations through robust data management methods which bodes well  We believe this will aid Broadcom s top line  going forward Further  the company s strong relationships with leading OEMs across multiple target markets have helped it to gain key insights into the requirements of customers  This insight has enhanced the company s efficiency and productivity in better serving the target markets and customers In the last reported quarter  Wireless Communications  31  of total revenues  was down 5  year over year to roughly  1 7 billion  Decline in large wireless customers remains a headwind The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Wireless Communications segment revenues are pegged at  1 492 billion  down 32 5  year over year Meanwhile  Enterprise Storage  23  of total revenues  soared 96  from the year ago quarter to  1 3 billion  The improvement can primarily be attributed to contribution from the recently acquired Brocade Fibre Channel switch business and strong enterprise IT spending The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Enterprise Storage segment revenues are pegged at  1 240 billion  up 25 1  year over year Wired Infrastructure revenues  41  of total revenues  totaled  2 2 billion  up 3  from the year ago quarter  The upside was primarily driven by robust demand for cloud data centers and traditional enterprises Broadcom s expanding product portfolio makes it well poised to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like Internet of Things  IoT  and 5G We believe that the company s extensive product portfolio is likely to positively impact the to be reported quarter s results Further  Broadcom pursues an aggressive acquisition strategy  which in turn fortifies its business model by diversifying end markets However  decline in its large wireless customers and sluggish spending on video access in the China optical markets remain concerns What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model  a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive   However  stocks carrying a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5

100737,322252,AVGO,Trump signs order prohibiting Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump issued an order on Monday prohibiting Broadcom Ltd s  O AVGO  proposed takeover of  Qualcomm Inc   O QCOM  on grounds of national security  
Qualcomm has rebuffed Broadcom s  117 billion takeover offer  which is under investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  a multi agency panel led by the Treasury Department that reviews national security implications when foreign entities take over U S  corporations ",2018-03-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-signs-order-prohibiting-broadcom-takeover-of-qualcomm-1337967,1337967
100738,322253,AVGO,President Trump halts Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm,news," Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump on Monday blocked microchip maker Broadcom Ltd s  O AVGO  proposed takeover of  Qualcomm Inc   O QCOM  on national security grounds  ending what would have been the technology industry s biggest deal ever amid concerns that it would give China the upper hand in mobile communications  The presidential order reflected a calculation that the United States  lead in creating technology and setting standards for the next generation of mobile cell phone communications would be lost to China if Singapore based Broadcom took over San Diego based Qualcomm  according to a White House official  Qualcomm has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to China s Huawei Technologies Co  HWT UL  in the sector  making Qualcomm a prized asset   Qualcomm had earlier rebuffed Broadcom s  117 billion bid  which was under investigation by the U S  Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   a multi agency panel led by the Treasury Department that reviews the national security implications of acquisitions of U S  corporations by foreign companies  In a letter on March 5  CFIUS said it was investigating whether Broadcom would starve Qualcomm of research dollars that would allow it to compete and also cited the risk of Broadcom s relationship with  third party foreign entities   While it did not identify those entities  the letter repeatedly described Qualcomm as the leading company in so called 5G technology development and standard setting   A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States   CFIUS said   While the United States remains dominant in the standards setting space currently  China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover   NATIONAL SECURITY AND HUAWEI A White House official on Monday confirmed that the national security concerns related to the risks of Broadcom s relationship with third party foreign entities  A source familiar with CFIUS  thinking had said that  if the deal was completed  the U S  military was concerned that within 10 years   there would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that s essentially Huawei  and then the American carriers would have no choice  They would just have to buy Huawei  equipment    Huawei has been forging closer commercial ties with big telecom operators across Europe and Asia  putting it in prime position to lead the global race for 5G networks despite U S  concerns  Huawei has a dominant position in China  which is set to become the world s biggest 5G market by far  and has also made inroads in the rest of world to compete with rivals such as Ericsson  ST ERICb  and Nokia  HE NOKIA  in several lucrative markets  including countries that are longstanding U S  allies  Qualcomm is also a major player in 5G  estimated to have 15 percent of 5G essential patents in the world  compared with 11 percent for Nokia and 10 percent for all of China  according to a Jefferies report citing LexInnova research  Many smartphone makers are counting on Qualcomm to deliver its 5G chipset on time in late 2018 to roll out their 5G phones in 2019  Shares of Broadcom rose less than 1 0 percent to  264 10 in after hours trade while Qualcomm fell 4 3 percent to  60 14  Broadcom said it was reviewing the presidential order   Broadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns   it said in a statement in response to the decision   Qualcomm  which had delayed its annual shareholder meeting during the CFIUS review  set the new date for March 23  The move by Trump to kill the deal comes only months after the U S  president himself stood next to Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan at the White House  announcing the company s decision to move its headquarters to the United States and calling it  one of the really great  great companies    This is the fifth time a U S  president has blocked a deal based on CFIUS objections and the second deal Trump has stopped since assuming office slightly over a year ago    The proposed takeover of Qualcomm by the Purchaser  Broadcom  is prohibited  and any substantially equivalent merger  acquisition  or takeover  whether effected directly or indirectly  is also prohibited   the presidential order released on Monday said  The order cited  credible evidence  that led Trump to believe that Broadcom s taking control of Qualcomm  might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States   BROADCOM S NEXT MOVE Broadcom had struggled to complete its proposed deal to buy Qualcomm  which had cited several concerns including the price offered and potential antitrust hurdles  The presidential decision to block the deal cannot be appealed  However  it is not clear what rules Broadcom would have to follow if it goes ahead with announced plans to move its headquarters to the United States  Companies may challenge CFIUS s jurisdiction in court but may not challenge the inter agency panel s national security findings  a CFIUS expert said  If Broadcom decides to press on with its effort to buy Qualcomm  it would be wise to drop the matter for now while the company quietly wraps up its move to the United States  a second CFIUS expert said  Once the move is done  Broadcom could argue that CFIUS does not have jurisdiction  the second expert said

A U S  government panel  in an unusual move  stepped into Singapore based Broadcom s hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm this week  citing a number of concerns around the development of the next generation of mobile networks and technology 
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  delayed a shareholder meeting that had threatened to hand Broadcom control of the Qualcomm board and  among other things  said lower R D spending would weaken U S  based Qualcomm against Chinese companies 
It said that Broadcom s recent statements and its history in other buyouts suggested the heavily leveraged  117 billion bid for Qualcomm would lead to such a reduction in investment in favor of short term profits 
 Broadcom will not only maintain the R D resources Qualcomm devotes to 5G and innovation in future wireless standards   we will also focus R D spend to those critical technologies that are essential to the U S    Broadcom said on Wednesday 
The statement also promised to create a  1 5 billion fund with a focus on innovation to train and educate the next generation of U S  engineers to ensure the country s lead in future wireless technology

100831,322346,AVGO,Broadcom Inc   AVGO  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 6  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  5 52 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20 3  
Revenues are expected to be  5 41 billion  up 11 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 97  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Broadcom Inc 
For Broadcom Inc The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  5 18  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Broadcom Inc  Will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Broadcom Inc  Would post earnings of  4 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 98  delivering a surprise of  3 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Broadcom Inc  Doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/broadcom-inc-avgo-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200363630,200363630

100920,322435,AVGO,Congress Is About To Give Trump More Trade Discretion,opinion,"Predictably  even controversially  each of the three premises of the US trade policy has been undermined  First  the US tariff schedule is low  but it is not the lowest in the world  Yes  it does have a low 2 5  tariff on auto imports  but there is a 25  tariff on SUVs   
Second  the steel and aluminum tariffs are unlikely to reduce the US trade deficit  Even if there is some import substitution effect  the higher prices can be expected to reduce demand  The main driver of the US trade deficit is the strength of the US economy  The mature business cycle was given significant fiscal stimulus  The May trade balance will be reported later this week but in the first four months of the year  the US shortfall is averaging  50 5 bln compared with  45 3 bln in the year ago period and  40 9 bln in the Jan April period in 2016   
Third  and related  contrary to administration assurances  countries are indeed retaliating   Canada s actions went into effect on July 1  The impact of the countervailing tariffs need to be incorporated into the cost benefit analysis  The EUs have already been implemented  At the end of the week  the US and China will be imposing tariffs on  34 bln of each other s goods   
The US continues to threaten to take another step on the escalation ladder  Auto imports are under investigation on national security grounds  The amount of trade that could be impacted dwarfs the other sectors that have been impacted by a revival of American economic nationalism   
Last week s decision by the Trump Administration not to pursue plans to boost restrictions on Chinese investment is a Pyrrhic victory for what passes as the free trade wing of the administration   Despite the criticism of the administration s trade policy  Trump enjoys a high level of support within the Republican Party  Some are not keen on treating Canada  Europe and Japan as threats to national security   
Despite these reservations  Congress is about to give the president a powerful weapon  With the help of the US Treasury and Commerce Secretaries  Congress has passed a bill that will strengthen the current review process of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS    Technically  CFIUS is an advisory body for the president  The bill is working its way through the reconciliation process   
It will give Trump the kind of authority that others had thought required a new process  Going forward  CFIUS will have the authority to block not only majority owned acquisitions but also minority stakes  25  when the foreign entity is 25  owned by a foreign government   It will also be able to block joint ventures  which had been used to circumvent scrutiny  Start ups and real estate investment also will come under the purview of the committee  It also makes the export control regime more robust   
The US has not waited for a stronger CFIUS  It has used the existing mechanism to formally block two foreign acquisitions  including most recently Broadcom s  NASDAQ AVGO  attempt to take Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   There have also been many offers that were withdrawn before a formal decision was made  There has been a general cooling of Chinese direct investment in the US in H1 18  with some industry estimates suggesting it has fallen by 90  year over year   
There were not objections raised by Congress so as of July 1  Trade Promotion Authority  in which congressional authority to regulate commerce is deferred to arguably a large extent to the executive branch until 2021  Although many portray Trump as extreme on trade  House and Senate Republicans remain highly supportive  Brady  the chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee was quoted saying   We support the president s challenge to China and others on unfair trade practices   Brady s language also confirms that while China s trade practices are bothersome  the Republican Party supports a broader reassertion of American economic power  Trump s claim that the EU is almost as bad as China may not be far from where a new consensus may be emerging  Still  the red line for Congress may be the threatened auto tariff or a NAFTA WTO withdrawal   
Still  US appears poised to antagonize China in a different way  There are a few possible actions that could materialize in the coming week which would irk Chinese officials  Reports indicate that the US State Department requested marines be sent to Taiwan to ostensibly guard the US diplomatic power there  If the request is granted  it would be the first time in 40 years that the US had marines in what China says and the US officially recognizes as a province of China   
There are also officials advocating sending a warship there the Taiwanese Straits  which the US did last July   There are some who are advocating a more provocative step  sending an aircraft carrier  which it has not done since 2007  While perfectly within the US right  of course  it would be as if China or Russia sent a military ship into the Caribbean

100921,322436,AVGO,Broadcom Sinks On CA Acquisition,opinion,"Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  traded  17  lower on Thursday morning  after announcing the acquisition of CA Technologies  CA  for for  18 9 billion in cash 
Broadcom announced after yesterday s market close  that it had agreed to purchase CA for  44 50 per share  That price implies a premium of 19 5  over CA s closing price of  37 21  On a hunt to acquire  mission critical technology businesses   Broadcom was eager for a win  having stumbled in its recent effort to take over Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  
 With its sizeable installed base of customers  CA is uniquely positioned across the growing and fragmented infrastructure software market   explained Broadcom CEO  Hock Tan  Meanwhile  CA Technologies CEO Mike Gregoire  noted that  our shareholders will receive a significant and immediate premium for their shares  
Analysts at Evercore and RBC Capital downgraded the stock  essentially agreeing with the market that Broadcom had overpaid  In any case  it should be noted that the deal still needs to be approved by government authorities in the US  Europe  and Japan 
In analyzing the AVGO weekly chart  we recall our analysis that a head and shoulders top had formed  Our downside projection was for  160  Looking at its market cycles  we can see the stock is in the declining phase of its current cycle  It is now approaching the  188  194 support zone  and we expect a bounce in the coming weeks

100926,322441,AVGO,CEOs go M A hunting as booming markets unleash dealmaking spirits,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia NEW YORK LONDON  Reuters    Mergers and acquisitions had another strong year in 2017  reaching their third highest annual level since the 2008 financial crisis  as CEOs were emboldened by buoyant markets to pursue transformative deals  even when their targets resisted  Companies negotiated large deals this year even before they had certainty that U S  tax reforms advocated by President Donald Trump s Republican party would become law  as economic growth around the world  including in Europe  accelerated  Setting 2017 apart was the willingness of potential acquirers to approach their targets unsolicited  In some instances  as with chipmaker Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Ltd s  103 billion cash and stock bid to take over peer Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  the target companies refused to engage in talks   In cases where companies have been sold  close to 80 percent of them were initiated by the buyer approaching the seller as opposed to companies who decided to sell   said Michael Carr  global co head of mergers   acquisitions at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS     Some of this is driven by buyers who believe they will not face competition  which encourages them to aggressively pressure their targets confidentially with the implied threat that they will go public   Carr added  Unsolicited takeover approaches helped push global M A to  3 54 trillion in 2017  roughly in line with last year s  3 59 trillion  according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data  The peak M A year since 2008 was 2015  when M A totaled  4 22 trillion  The dealmaking environment has been favorable in the last three years due to the availability of cheap debt financing and high CEO confidence  Geopolitical turmoil  including a potential confrontation over North Korea s nuclear ambitions and faltering negotiations to form a coalition government in Germany  failed to dampen M A spirits   Geopolitical uncertainty has had relatively little impact on our deals pipeline this year   said Cyrus Kapadia  vice chairman of investment banking at Lazard Ltd   Boards are supportive of deal making where there is clear strategic rationale  and even in Britain  where Brexit is causing some uncertainty  companies are still pursuing large scale deals to enhance organic growth   he added  EUROPE  ASIA PACIFIC M A UP A 16 percent year on year drop in M A in the United States to  1 4 trillion was offset on a global basis by a 16 percent rise in M A in Europe to  856 billion and an 11 percent rise in Asia Pacific M A to  912 billion  according to Thomson Reuters data  Among this year s biggest acquisitions were U S  drugstore chain operator CVS Health  NYSE CVS  Corp s  69 billion agreement to buy health insurer  Aetna Inc   NYSE AET   Walt Disney Co s  52 billion deal to buy film and television businesses from Rupert Murdoch s Twenty First Century Fox Inc  and aerospace supplier United Technologies  NYSE UTX  Corp s  30 billion agreement to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc  NYSE COL   Many of these deals had stock as part of the purchase price  with acquirers emboldened to use their own shares as currency given their high stock market valuations  as opposed to offering just cash   We are seeing a stock component becoming a bigger portion of the offers being made  perhaps because the deals are bigger and transformative  and acquirers are looking to offer targets additional upside in these transactions   said Stephen Arcano  an M A partner at law firm Skadden  Arps  Slate  Meagher   Flom LLP   Private equity backed M A activity totaled  322 6 billion globally in 2017  a 27 percent increase compared to last year  as more buyout firms sought to put money they have raised from their investors to work  Dealmakers say the prospect of the U S  tax overhaul has so far had little influence on deal negotiations   If you are an acquirer  you are likely modeling a deal where the synergies and the incremental value of combining is what is driving your purchase price and your premium  not an assumption on the underlying tax rate   said Chris Ventresca  global M A co head at  JPMorgan Chase   Co   If you are considering selling the entire company  as long as the buyer is willing to pay your price  you take the certainty of crystallizing a premium now with some ability to participate in tax reform upside via buyer stock   Ventresca added  Companies may decide to allocate more of their cash to M A in 2018 following the implementation of the U S  tax changes  however

100982,322497,AVGO,Week Ahead  Trump Rattles Markets  Again   Can Earnings Boost Stocks ,opinion,"All major US indices close the week lower on renewed trade war jitters
NFP misses but wage growth supports higher income without inflation spike
Earnings season expected to be best in eight years
Domestic politics add to market uncertainty


After a second tumultuous week  during which traders repeatedly chased equities up  then down  on escalating  then waning  then once again rising trade war uncertainty only to finish the week down across the board where do markets head next  All major US indices finished the week lower  the Dow lost 2 34  on Friday  the S P 500 slipped 2 19   the NASDAQ Composite declined 2 28  and the Russell 2000 fell 1 92 
Of course  it s impossible to accurately predict with complete certainty where markets will go next  However  right now the S P 500 is consolidating  meaning it s going neither up nor down but rather sideways  This indicates that all supply and demand is being absorbed within a 90 point range or a 3 percent band  within the 2 675 and 2 585 levels on the S P 500 Index 
In other words  the benchmark index is in a period when everyone who has an opinion about where the index should go next puts in his two cents by either buying or selling  while at the same time those who don t have an opinion wait on the sidelines for a conclusion  a breakout in either direction  to be determined by those who have a stronger opinion  which will then determine the trend  Since the stock market is  in essence  a glorified voting machine in which each dollar gets a vote  whichever side has more dollars and thus more votes will lead the breakout in that direction 
Along with the wobbly weekly price action  a significantly lower Friday close is worrisome  as it demonstrates that investors are not willing to commit to a weekend of optimism about markets and thus a higher close  This reflects an environment in which investors see the potential for a lot to go wrong 
Worrisome End Of Week Metrics
Another distressing signal  breadth supported the selloff  as all sectors traded lower  Defensive sectors with high yielding dividend equities outperformed  including Utilities  NYSE Real Estate and Consumer Staples 
The worst performers were tech and internet stocks  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  was a particular drag on the market  plunging 2 57   possibly because investors could be viewing it as a broad proxy for the economy  sending a signal that a trade war would hurt overall economic growth 

Investors rotated out of risk assets and into safe havens such as bonds  the Japanese yen and gold  to finish the week 
Will Earnings Buoy Stocks 
Investors are hoping to hang on till earning season begins  The unofficial kick off is at the end of this coming week when Citigroup  NYSE C   JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  report 
There are two reasons the corporate earnings reports released over the next few weeks will be significant  First  it s basic dollars and cents  Actual metrics indicating company strength or weakness provide something more reliable than the geopolitical headlines and fear that have been whipsawing stocks over the past ten sessions 
Second  after the recent tax overhaul  analysts added 6 percent to their growth expectations  bringing this earnings season s forecast to 18 percent  If realized  this would be the strongest growth in eight years 
Finally  even though earnings estimates have not changed  stocks are considerably cheaper on a forward P E multiple  When the S P 500 hit its February high  they were 18 5  at the March high the multiple was 17 2  now it s 16 8

Last week we said that the S P 500 provided a downside breakout of a bearish pennant  red lines in SPX chart  above   However  earlier last week  the sharp relief that followed lowered expectations of trade concerns allowed the price to blow the pattern out 
Now  while it s possible the current consolidation could end up forming a bearish flag  black lines   the lack of proportion reduces the probability  As a matter of interest  however  a beautifully proportional bullish flag has been formed on the VIX chart  Should the same psychology of price action apply to fear reaction  an upside breakout may suggest a much higher VIX reading  the prelude to a sharp market decline 
Market Risks  Political Threats
On Friday  the monthly Nonfarm Payrolls release showed 103 000 new jobs were created in March  a bit more than half the 193 000 expected by economists  Perhaps because February s number was revised higher  thereby keeping the longer term trend of sturdy growth to a robust average of 201 000 jobs created in the first three months of the year  or because this monthly data was overshadowed by Trump s escalation of the possibility of a full out trade war  there was no palpable reaction to this major miss  Perhaps the modest uptick in inflation to 2 7 percent signaled that employment conditions are likely to lead to higher incomes albeit not fast enough for a repeat of the early February panicked selloff on the outlook of a faster tightening  seen as slowing growth 
While the outlook for corporate earnings and economic growth support the view that stocks should rise  an escalation of the looming trade war risk and other political uncertainties may scare investors into selling off anyway  Traders may be concerned that President Donald Trump is just too unpredictable for a stable market 
Trump s new economic advisor Larry Kudlow said he d  about the newest China tariffs on Thursday night  after markets  not a particularly auspicious way to begin his tenure  As well  Chief of Staff John Kelly has threatened to quit  according to Axios  adding to a long string of advisors who have voluntarily exited the administration or were made to leave 
Another potential threat  though seemingly unlikely right now  is that a trade war could be a classic lead in to an actual war  The Tariff Act of 1930  also known as the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act was meant to revive an economic slump  Instead it exacerbated the Great Depression  leading to a tariff face off between the US and Europe  At that time  nationalist rhetoric increased  with nations blaming other nations for the poor economic conditions that ultimately led to WWII 
It s perhaps noteworthy  therefore that in March  Trump prohibited Singapore based Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  from buying US based Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   citing national security concerns  Indeed  it would have allowed the gap between US technology dominance and Asia to be closed  Of course  the current trade uncertainty began when Trump announced that the US would be levying taxes on imported steel and aluminum because unfair trade practices  were an assault to our country  
That paves the way  even if it s still a long shot  for the possibility of an all out war  Just recently  Japan  a US ally  for the first time since WWII activated its marine defenses  to enhance protection against China 
However  before there s even talk of armed conflict  some believe China could harm the US via its  1 17 trillion worth of US sovereign debt holdings  Should China reduce its Treasury portfolio as a way of hitting back against the US s tariff proposals  the dollar could enter a downward spiral  as other countries may follow suit and sell their Treasury holdings too 
While a bond selloff would also be bad for China since it would likely have to sell some Treasurys at a loss  still  China has a history of putting politics ahead of its economy  It could decide that it s strong enough to absorb the loss 
Though there are those who are bearish on the economy  seeing flattening employment and slowing growth  most analysts and economists remain bullish  But geopolitics and domestic political uncertainty still have the ability to spike volatility and rattle markets  It makes sense  therefore that investors are hoping they can hold on till earnings season lifts markets and  if results match expectations  this will be the strongest earnings season since 2010  If that doesn t occur  bulls may have nothing left to hold on to 
And that would be a catalyst for a much more significant correction

100984,322499,AVGO,Why Did Qualcomm  QCOM  Stock Fall Today ,opinion,"Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM    a multinational semiconductor and telecommunications equipment firm  saw its shares drop 4 5  on Thursday  The company has had problems closing a deal with NXP   NYSE NXP    a Dutch semiconductor company  forcing them to withdraw and refile a previously set merger application with Chinese authorities 
Qualcomm is currently awaiting approval from China  the last of the required global regulators  to move through with the merger 
Meanwhile  news of up to 1 500 layoffs as a means to save money has spawned doubt and rattled investors  Along with this  increased competition with Broadcam   NASDAQ AVGO    another chip manufacturing company  has shaken previous confidence in the company 
This announcement and subsequent drop on the day is sticking true to the trend for Qualcomm in recent months  Year to date  shares have dropped 20 7   mostly as a result of this failed merger and its consequences 
Although the stock has steadily declined  it might still be attractive to some investors  But with  C  grades for Value and Growth in our Style Scores system  Qualcomm shares look shaky for a few reasons 
The company s P E of 16 5 and P CF of 11 5 beat industry averages  but its P B ratio of 3 4 is almost twice the average of its industry  In similar fashion  while the company has cash flow of  4 80 per share almost four times the industry average it also holds a debt to equity ratio of 0 8  which is a significant premium to the industry average  This discrepancy is what leads to Qualcomm s average grade for Value 
And if potential investors were looking for strong analyst opinions  they would be met with disappointment  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Qualcomm s full year earnings has moved just a penny higher over the past 60 days  while our consensus projection for its next fiscal year has actually moved a penny lower over that time 
Bottom Line
Qualcomm has been struggling in the stock market since the start of this year  A gradual decline in the midst of merger complications  layoffs  and lack of public confidence has hurt the company over the past few months  especially today 
While there are some positive numbers that support respectable Value and Growth  they are counteracted by statistics that negate the same measures  Overall  mixed analyst sentiment has caused this stock to receive a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

101039,322554,AVGO,What Next For Qulacomm After Trump Blocks Takeover ,opinion," The proposed takeover of Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   by the Purchaser  Broadcom     NASDAQ AVGO   is prohibited  and any substantially equivalent merger  acquisition  or takeover  whether effected directly or indirectly  is also prohibited   the presidential order read 
The order was purportedly based on the national security findings of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   but some news reports indicated that no formal order had reached the President and the decision appeared to have been made beforehand 
Other reports quoted CFIUS as saying   A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States   and  While the United States remains dominant in the standards setting space currently  China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover  
According to a Jefferies report  which cited LexInnova research  Qualcomm is estimated to have a 15  share of 5G essential patents  Nokia   NYSE NOK   11  and all of China 10  
At any rate  the presidential order can t be challenged  nor can the findings of the CFIUS  although the CFIUS jurisdiction can be challenged 
Broadcom is doing none of the above and instead stepping away from the deal  including the nomination of directors to replace the current board and focusing on its redomiciling plans  This is a win for the Trump administration because it will bring back tax revenue  There will be a negative impact on Broadcom because the tax rates in the U S  are higher 
On the positive side  Broadcom  once it gets rid of its foreign ownership control  will be able to pursue most acquisitions in the U S  without interference from the CFIUS or other regulatory scrutiny  other than the standard procedures  
This was quite an unprecedented move wherein Qualcomm management approached the CFIUS to block the deal and the President moved to stop it even before there was an agreement between the companies  It shows that all is far from well at Qualcomm where shareholders were in favor of the deal that management and the board opposed 
So now management have their work cut out  to convince shareholders that Qualcomm is worth much more than Broadcom was willing to pay  And they need to complete the NXP Semiconductor   NASDAQ NXPI   acquisition as soon as possible 
Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  while Broadcom has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can also see

Key Events
US stocks fell yesterday  extending a decline for the S P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average to a second day 
Despite inflation data confirming the likelihood of a slower path to higher interest rates than recently feared  political headwinds pulled the rug from under the feet of investors  and fears of rapidly increasing US oil supplies pulled down the energy sector  US President Donald Trump fired another senior official Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  while fresh plans for broader trade tariff measures signaled Trump s determination to keep marching down the path toward a trade war 
The S P 500 fell 0 64 percent  for a total loss over the 2 day period of 0 75 percent  Technology   1 15   led the declines  dragged down by a 5 9 plunge in Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  shares following Trump s executive order to block Broadcom s  NASDAQ AVGO   117 billion hostile takeover of the the US based chip maker 
The second worst performing sector was Financials   1 08    after news broke that CPI rose 0 2 percent  in line with estimates though it was the weakest result in years  according to Bloomberg  The sluggish reading eased worries of faster interest rate tightening  which last month triggered a stock selloff  For banks  however  lower rates which drive profits via rates on loans signal a reduced profit outlook ahead 
The third sector to pull down the the SPX was Energy   0 7    after API reported that US crude stockpiles increased by 1 16 million barrels 
The only three sectors in the green were Real Estate   0 32    followed by Utilities   0 22 percent  and Health Care   0 12   
The Dow dropped 0 67 percent  bringing its two day slide to 1 28 percent 

The NASDAQ Composite tumbled by almost one percent and the NASDAQ 100 slipped 1 15 percent on the White House s squelching of Broadcom s Qualcomm bid  It was the first setback for the tech indices after a 7 day winning streak for both  the pair even posted fresh record highs before each closed lower albeit both managed to remain above their January and February peaks  As well  technicals formed bearish Dark Cloud Covers  something that occurs when prices open higher than the previous rising candle but close beneath it 
Previous peaks which had been overcome presumably provided support  After their former resistance was penetrated on Thursday  traders shorting the indices were stopped out  on the presumed repeat of the two previous selloffs from these levels  Bears scurried to cover shorts by buying back stocks  to return them to the broker  
This naturally further increases demand  The higher it goes  the more traders want to hop on for the ride  pushing prices even higher  On the other hand  two relatively flat peaks  followed by a higher peak  may develop into a H S top  One test is whether prices will remain above the uptrend line since February 9  when stocks bottomed after the first selloff  provoked by fears of higher interest rates and Treasury yields surging to a 4 year high 
The Russell 2000 lost 0 5 percent  It outperformed its peers thanks to the fact that the small  domestic firms listed on the index are not reliant on exports for profit growth  The current equity selloff has been sparked by fears of a looming trade war  after Trump announced his intentions to impose harsh tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on March 1  The more a company relies on exports  the worse it has performed as trade war jitters mount 
Last year  for example  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  sold more than half of its products overseas  Perhaps this is why the stock lost up to 15 percent of its value by February 5  despite January corporate results that smashed expectations  and was nearly 9 percent down by yesterday s close 
Tillerson s dismissal not only added to the instability sparked by the high turnover among senior White House administrative staffers  it also took place at a time that is more significant than it may at first seem  Coming immediately after Trump blocked Broadcom s bid and just as his administration gears up for a trade war  what at first seemed to be an out of the blue replacement of such a senior position can hardly be viewed as a coincidence 
This is reinforced by the fact that Gary Cohn  Trump s chief economic advisor  stepped down last week because of the same issue  The new Secretary of State will be CIA director Mike Pompeo  who shares the president s hawkish views 
Global Financial Affairs
Today  Asian benchmarks slumped across the board  with Japan s TOPIX  China s mainland Shanghai Composite  Hong Kong s Hang Seng Index  Australia s S P ASX 200 and South Korea s KOSPI all affected by soaring trade war fears 
Ironically  after factory output and investment unexpectedly accelerated in China the largest commodities consumer globally the STOXX Europe 600 ticked higher  with raw material producers outperforming 
However  China s clamp down on financial risks along with escalating signs of a trade war are likely to overshadow any economic improvement  for the time being  Perhaps the Fed  led by a new Chair  can reinvigorate a sense of stability for investors when its monetary policy is reviewed next week 

The dollar is unable to maintain gains against the yen  even as political pressure increases in Japan 

WTI has struggled to recoup losses from last month s broader market slump  after topping  66 a barrel in January  While a brighter economic outlook has underpinned demand expectations  expanding American production remains a challenge for OPEC and its allies  The cartel is trying to prop up prices via output curbs 

Analysts from Allianz Global said Bitcoin is worthless and its bubble will soon pop  Meanwhile  Google announced that it plans to ban all cryptocurrency related ads  following in the footsteps of Facebook   Technically  BTC is poised to complete two bearish patterns  a Double Top and a Falling Flag

Trump clearing the way on measures to push back China threats
Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson after some clashes  and replaced him by Mike Pompeo  Director of the CIA  That s less than a week after departure of White House economic advisor Gary Cohn  Both Tillerson and Cohn are seen as the globalists in Trump s team  And their departure  is another step in the protectionist direction  Also  Pompeo is known for endorsing  pushing back against the Chinese threat  
Separately  it s reported that Trump is preparing a new package targeted at China  on trade and investments  There could be as much as USD 60b tariffs on Chinese goods  The tariffs  associated with a  Section 301  intellectual property investigation  under the 1974 US Trade Act begun in August last year  could come in the very near future 
And  White House blocked semi conductor manufacturer Broadcom s bid for the semiconductor maker  Trump declared earlier in the week that the proposed US 117B deal was prohibited on national security grounds  He noted that  there is credible evidence  that Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  through control of Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States   Indeed  it is believe that the key reason behind is the US concern over Broadcom s business practice of cost reduction  It is concerned that the company would reduce investment and weaken Qualcom s 5G development roadmap  thus weakening US position in the technology and giving way to China to take the lead 
BoJ Kuroda repeated his message  Long way from meeting inflation target
BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda repeated his rhetorics that Japan is still long way from meeting the 2  inflation target  Therefore  it s too early to talk about stimulus exit  But he assured the parliament that the central bank has the tools to smoothly exit from the ultra loose monetary policy when needed  Kuroda added that  by combining various tools  it s possible to shrink the BoJ s balance sheet at an appropriate pace while keeping markets stable   Meanwhile  he also hailed that while keeping long term yield low with the policy  BoJ also managed to maintain markets  trust in JGBs  He noted  If market trust over Japan s debt is eroded  it will be difficult for us to keep interest rates low with our yield curve control policy  
Release earlier  minutes of BoJ January meeting showed that some board members were concerned with the impact of the loose monetary policy  especially on banks  The minutes showed  some members said it was important to continue to monitor and assess the positive impacts and side effects of the current monetary easing policy  including its effects on Japan s banking system   Some member suggested to raised the yield target as economy improves  But another member  obviously Goushi Kataoka   called for ramping up the stimulus 
Canadian Dollar tumbles as markets interpreted Poloz as dovish
BoC Governor Stephen Polo sounded quite balanced on the labor market in his speech overnight  But markets looked at the dovish side of it  Poloz said there are untapped potential in the economy  including workforce by youth  women  indigenous peoples  Canadians with disabilities and recent immigrants to Canada  And  he added  it is not much of a stretch to imagine that Canada s labour force could expand by another half a million workers   On the other hand  he noted that participation rate usually declines during recessions and rebounds on recovery  But  that has yet to occur for young Canadians   He over tone suggested there could be larger slack in the labor market and the economy could handle more growth without inflation  The markets interpreted that as a warning that tightening may not happen as fast as they expected  But after all  to us  NAFTA renegotiation is the most critical factor for BoC ahead

101068,322583,AVGO,Investor Caution Lingers,opinion,"In spite of the anaemic volumes overnight  the USD was broadly weaker  Most are attributing the lower volumes to the start of spring break which is traditionally a time for many US traders to head south with their families  But the miss on last Friday s AHE and easing of overall inflation expectations has seen traders subtly downgrade of the Fed s interest rate path and the dollar has weakened in consort 
Equity investors are finding it difficult to ignore the gnawing concerns about trade wars and are adopting a defence first strategy despite the Goldilocks jobs number  Keep in mind the spotlight will be on US CPI tonight  and it was only one month ago a surprise inflation print sent the market into a tailspin  so likely some caution ahead of the critical US inflation data  Overall investors remain very cautious as sentiment recovers 
Speaking of trade wars and protectionism  President Donald Trump issued an order Monday evening blocking any merger of the chipmaking giants Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  and Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   saying it was necessary to protect national security  There is  credible evidence   the order says  that if the Singapore based Broadcom took control of the US based Qualcomm that the company  might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States   Pretty clear the president is setting sights on Asia using what seems to be an arbitrary national security provision 
Oil
Oil prices moved lower in NY after Energy Information Administration published a report that Crude production from seven major U S  shale plays is expected to see a climb of 131 000 barrels a day in April to 6 954 million barrels a day with the Permian Basin to see the most significant play with production increasing 80 000 barrels per day  Both the surge in US production along with rising US exports gaining a bigger slice of the Asian pie continue to weigh on OPEC compliance  On cue  media reports are suggesting another fissure forming on OPEC compliance  On one side is Saudi Arabia  which wants oil prices at  70 a barrel or higher  and on the other is Iran  which wants them around  60 fearing that US shale production will continue to ramp up production as prices near  70 00 
Prices bounced off overnight lows the bearish signals continue to form which should weigh in top side momentum ahead of this week s critical inventory data 
Gold
Gold prices were stable to higher overnight as the USD nudged lower as higher US interest rates fears have abated after the lower wage report on Friday  But gold traders are adopting a more neutral stance as we enter Fed blackout period  While a March hike if fully priced in  traders usually get a bit anxious awaiting the Fed statement and key forward guidance  so we should expect interest rate uncertainty to weigh on prices over the short term 
Currency Markets
The Japanese Yen
The dollar traded either side of 106 50 levels overnight  but we re probably nearing a short term inflexion point after the markets failed to move above the 107 level when risk appetite blossomed on the lower wages inflation print and US North Korea headline  Global uncertainty and risk aversion continue to linger  but overall markets remain very sticky within the 106 handle 
I m confident traders were holding onto USD JPY shorts by a thread at yesterday weekly Asia open  but the top side was tempered with the developments in the Moritomo scandal 
The escalation of Japan political risk tops all and will continue to push USD JPY lower as these headlines evolve around this deepening scandal 
The Euro
The euro seems very content to trade around the 1 2300 levels  and traders are showing little interest in any direction  Likely a function of the recent softer run of economic data but the Euro remain very much an inflow and policy normalisation play  and traders continue to buy the dips expecting stronger output growth to re emerge 
The Australian Dollar
The Australian dollar is still enjoying the bounce in risk sentiment while the softer US wages continues to weigh US bond yield  However  commodity markets are showing some stress as oil prices fell on US supply concerns  Given the Aussie dollar strong proclivity to commodity prices  top side momentum will be tempered even more so with interest rate rates as playing an insignificant role in AUD fortunes 
The Malaysian Ringgit
The market remains a range play as investors remain very cautious as the EM FX Asia point of view recovers  Stronger jobs headline with subdued wage inflation should continue to prove supportive for the ringgit this week  However  the potential escalation in trade tension continues to loiter 
Given the constant barrage of US increasing oil production headlines weighing on oil prices  the MYR is getting little support energy prices  but at these current levels  minor sell offs are not denting overall sentiment but a more profound move below WTI 60 00 could ",2018-03-13,Stephen Innes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investor-caution-lingers-200297475,200297475
101069,322584,AVGO,Non Economic Developments Dominate Ahead Of U S  CPI,opinion,"The yen s 6  gain against the dollar this year makes it the strongest of the major currencies in the first quarter  Investors have been given another reason not to resist the seasonal pressures that often see Japanese investors repatriate capital ahead of the end of the fiscal year later this month 
Many see the eruption of the scandal that threatens Japanese senior government officials as yen positive because it weakens those that ostensibly want to depreciate the yen through monetary policy  The scandal involves falsifying documents to conceal a sweetheart deal  The government sold of state owned land to a school operator  reportedly with connections to Prime Minister Abe s wife  at an incredibly low price  At the end of last week  the head of the National Tax Agency chief resigned over comments he made before the Diet about the case  There is also an investigation into the possible suicide of a local finance ministry official that handled the land sale 
There is pressure on Finance Minister Aso  Reports already suggest he will not attend the upcoming G20 meeting  The scandal is weighing on public support for the government  The goodwill won by Prime Minister Abe on his tough line on North Korea  and China and more may have been lost  It is important for Abe to get closure on this as soon as possible or he may face a stronger challenge for party leadership in September 
Initial support for the dollar may be near JPY106 20  though the month s low was closer to JPY105 25  The JPY105 area is important psychological and chart support and the strongest support ahead of JPY100  In the second half of February  the dollar was turned back from JPY108  The cap has come down now to JPY107 00 
Prime Minister May gave Russia until the end of business on Tuesday to address the allegations that it used nerve gas in the UK earlier this month  When she was Home Secretary  May did not press Russia in the 2006 poisoning by plutonium of a Russian informant for British intelligence  This comes on the heels of the UK s objections to Russian interference in their election  A Labour MP claims that there are as many as 14 deaths that UK officials do not regard as suspicious though reportedly US intelligence suggests potential Russian involvement 
Sterling traded higher yesterday after recovering from a dip below  1 38 after the US employment data before the weekend  The  1 39230  1 3960 offers nearby resistance  Our reading of the technical indicators favors the upside  but risk reward for the short term suggests buying closer to the lower end of the range  which is still around  1 3800 
A third non economic development was the US government s preemptive decision to block Broadcom s  NASDAQ AVGO   117 bln acquisition of Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   National security concerns were cited  The US President acted on the recommendation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US  which reviews foreign acquisitions of US companies  Still  the prohibition was seen as aggressive because there was no agreement between the two companies  It is the first deal by a non Chinese company that was blocked by the US in a year 
Last year  Broadcom indicated it was considering moving its headquarters to the US  Reports suggest that  unlike the steel and aluminum tariffs  the Pentagon actually pressed for this sanction  while the Treasury Department was reportedly initially more reluctant 
The US s February CPI report will be released Tuesday morning  Expectations are that both core as well as consumer prices on all goods and services will both have increased 0 2  ",2018-03-13,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/noneconomic-developments-dominate-ahead-of-us-cpi-200297473,200297473

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower at 21 813  The S P 500 closed 0 17  higher while the Nasdaq Composite closed roughly flat  
Following a few days of low volume trade  U S  stocks sparked back into life  after a speech by Federal Reserve chair Yellen at Jackson Hole offered no insight into the central bank s thinking on future monetary policy  reducing expectations of a third rate hike later this year 
That speech came a few hours after chief economic advisor Gary Cohn sought to ease investor uncertainty over the Trump administration s ability to deliver on its economic agenda  saying that president will make a major push on tax reform over coming weeks 
In an interview with the Financial Times  Cohn said that the president will start publicly campaigning for tax reform in a series of speeches  the first one of which gets underway in Missouri on Wednesday 
Meanwhile economic data showing durable goods orders in July undershot expectations had little impact on U S  stocks

101116,322631,AVGO,Opening Bell  Dollar Rally Extends  Yields Gain  Bitcoin Slips,opinion,"US stocks end rally


Wal Mart plunges on missed earnings expectations


Yields continue to attract funds away from stocks


Treasury oversupply threatens second equity selloff


Stronger dollar makes US equities more expensive  both for foreign and domestic investors


Key Events 
US stocks ended a six day rally on Tuesday  selling off on several fundamental events 
Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  missed fourth quarter earnings expectations  weighing on averages
Rising bond yields pulled fund flows out of equities and
A strengthening dollar boosts the cost of US stocks for foreign investors

The S P 500 Index lost 0 58 percent confirming Monday s bearish Shooting Star candlestick  falling below the 50 dma  The drop was led by a 2 27 percent plunge in Consumer Staples 

The sector took a hit when Wal Mart slumped 10 percent  its worst performance in 30 years  as brick and mortar stores are losing market share to e commerce companies  led by Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Indeed  Technology was the only sector in the green yesterday  with a 0 09 percent gain 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0 98 percent  As with the S P 500  the decline  below the 50 dma in this case  confirms the previous day s shooting star 

The NASDAQ Composite outperformed its peers  falling less than 0 1 percent  It is also staying safely above its 50 dma  by 1 65 percent 

The NASDAQ 100 was boosted by chipmakers  The index climbed 0 15 percent  led by Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  which upped its bid for Dutch rival NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI  
It was a defensive move against a hostile  121 billion takeover attempt by Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   The latter revealed it was considering a bid on Qualcomm as of November 3  The news at the time propelled Qualcomm shares higher by as much as 19 percent in New York  the company s biggest intraday share activity since October 2008  after Bloomberg broke the takeover story  QCOM closed 12 8 percent higher at the time 

Yesterday  however  Qualcomm shares fell 3 percent  as investors who bought on hopes for the takeover by Broadcom  dumped the stock  Broadcom issued a statement criticizing Qualcomm for raising its offer for NXP and accused QCOM of transferring value from its own shareholders to those of NXP  Technically  the stock price completed a double top on February 5  with a 5 percent penetration  Yesterday s rebound seems to have been blocked by the resistance of the neckline 

Sure enough  NXPI soared 6 percent  reaching an all time high  against a falling market to boot 

Meanwhile  the Russell 2000 dropped 0 75 percent  It underperformed its peers on a technical basis  since it nearly reached its 100 dma  blue   At the same time  the S P 500 is 2 46 percent above its 100 dma  the Dow is 2 94 percent above its 100 dma and the NASDAQ Composite is 4 8 percent above its 100 dma 
Global Financial Affairs
This morning  European stocks retreated from yesterday s gains  in what became a fourth day range  The decline occurred despite gains during Asia trade 
Almost every sector of the STOXX Europe 600 Index fell  with the benchmark tracking losses seen on Tuesday during the US session rather than the more positive performance posted by Asian markets  Stocks listed on Hong Kong s Hang Seng advanced  cementing a rebound from one of the worst equity sell offs in years  which happened at the start of the month  S P 500 Futures edged lower 
Meanwhile  yesterday s US Treasury auction sold  179 billion worth of securities  rebuilding its cash balance  The recent spike in yields caused the sharpest equity downturn in the last couple of years  as investors rotated out of risky stocks and into secure  high yielding bonds  Moreover  the spike in yields prompted by the Treasury selloff suggested that the Fed might speed up the pace of rate tightening  thus increasing the cost of borrowing  making it more difficult to support record equity prices 
Since the selloff  equity investors have generally been consolidating  a sign of adjustment to the new price level  Since for every sale there is a buy  and prices stopped falling  it s assumed that new blood has come into current positions  ready to take on the burden of pushing prices back up  The consolidation suggests a cease fire between bears and bulls  which leaves the current price at equilibrium 
Yesterday s oversupply of two year Treasury notes and three  and six month bills went off at rates unseen since 2008  while the 10 year rate was up to 2 89 percent  This deluge could push yields higher still  potentially repeating the recent stock rout  While speculators are turning bearish  money managers are looking at the highest Treasury bond yields in years as a buying opportunity  in a world where shorter term Japanese and German notes still carry negative yields 
The outperforming US bond yields attract foreign demand  which requires investors to purchase the US dollar first 

The dollar extended gains before another round of US debt sale and the release of minutes from the latest Fed meeting  Since the Treasury selloff is on the outlook of faster rate hikes  it attracts dollar demand 
The greenback climbed for a fourth consecutive day  to the highest level within its current push  It s also set for the highest close in almost three weeks  since February 2  Should the price overcome the 90 57 level  it may be said to have completed a small double bottom 

Naturally  a dollar bottom would almost certainly mean a top for its primary peer the euro  The single currency could potentially complete a double bottom  with a downside break below 1 2200  On Thursday  minutes from the most recent ECB meeting will also be released 

The stronger USD makes the dollar denominated price of oil more expensive  Investors balanced the difference by pushing oil down toward  61 a barrel  ahead of US government data that is forecast to show crude inventories gained for a fourth week  Two key political risks on the horizon could also impact the price of oil going forward 
Technically  the price fell again below the uptrend line since August 31  opening the possibility of a decline to the flatter downtrend line since June 21 

Bitcoin slipped below  11 000  confirming yesterday s bearish Shooting Star  which attempted to cross above the downtrend line since December 17  the currency s all time high almost at  20 000  The battle now is between bulls drawing the uptrend line since February 6 and the  6 000 since December 17  drawn by bears  
Bitcoin as well as most other mainstream cryptocurrencies have had a tough 2018 so far  Still  not all digital coins have endured the wrath of sellers since the year began  some have been more resilient 
Up Ahead

101117,322632,AVGO,Deals  Earnings  And Fed Uncertainty Help Markets Rise  ,opinion," Do not underestimate the  power of underestimation   They can t stop you  if they don t see you coming     Izey Victoria Odias 
Whenever you walk into a store  especially one which is not a supermarket  salespeople are taught to somehow welcome your presence  In expensive  high end outlets  you might even have a door greeter say something like   Welcome to Tiffany s   if you have ever visited  you know the phrase  and bow or take off their top hat  Many people  like myself  hate to be bothered by anyone  so in order to help accomplish that goal  they might dress in a  shall we say  less formal way  Maybe even a touch sloppy  messy  or certainly not neat  They definitely would give the impression of a person without the means to afford expensive items  The sales person would then ignore them  as  why bother with a person who cannot help you earn your sales quota  commission  
In fact  many individuals use these kinds of techniques to throw others off the trail on purpose  When you are ignored  or underestimated  it is an advantage in almost every endeavor  In the world of investing  the ability to find situations others don t pay attention to is a crucial part of trying to outperform the indexes  or other investment professionals  Buying Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  up 30  after it has tripled shouldn t be mocked  but it also is probably not the recipe for out performance in the next decade  either  If you bought it after it crashed in 2000 to 5 bucks a share  well  clearly that is a different story  The same holds true about Facebook  NASDAQ FB  as a year after it went public  it fell to below 20  versus 180 now when everyone loves it  Forging your own solitary view of a business  especially when the rest of the world avoids it like the plague  requires plenty of research and analysis  and above all  the ability to live with being ignored and underestimated  Well  at least I think so 
On the macro front this week  Fed minutes showed uncertainty about inflation and the question of how quickly and how many times interest rates might go higher  Bond yields were bolstered a touch by heavy auctions and tepid demand  Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  missed the online portion of expectations while Home Depot  NYSE HD  impressed with another strong number  HP  NYSE HPE  showed strength in the enterprise arena while Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  solidified its position in acquiring NXP  to the detriment of Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   General Mills  NYSE GIS  showed its love for natural pet food products in the 8 billion dollar purchase of Blue Buffalo  while private equity based Albertsons will digest the leftovers of Rite Aid  NYSE RAD  
Warren Buffett released his annual shareholder letter today  and he stuck to the topic of investing and business  for the most part  I found most interesting his cash hoard of 120 billion or so and discipline in finding many companies too highly valued for his taste  In addition  his thoughts about being able to endure four 35  or more declines in portfolio value and why it is crucial to not use margin when investing are significant  It is a reminder of what can happen in markets  anything  and why prudence and patience are required 
Next week  markets will see another deluge of earnings reports  along with Jay Powell s first session in front of the ethical wonders that represent our fine country  the politicians   In that domain  I am not sure if I have ever seen a more contentious time in terms of having Republicans and Democrats agree on anything  It makes me want to ignore anything related to the subject  Of course  that might be exactly what those idiots wants from their constituents  They would have us right where they want us  being underestimated

101136,322651,AVGO,Toshiba under pressure to consider  Plan B  as chip sale falters  sources,news,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Taro Fuse TOKYO  Reuters    As the  18 billion sale of Toshiba Corp s memory chip unit to a government approved consortium falters  some bankers and potential investors are pressing the board to seriously consider alternatives  people with direct knowledge of the sale process said   including picking a new buyer  Those people say Toshiba s leadership is sticking to Plan A  selling the world s second largest memory chip maker to a Japanese government backed group that also includes Bain Capital  But the clock is ticking for Toshiba  which was still recovering from a  1 3 billion accounting scandal in 2015 when it was hit by billions of dollars of cost overruns at its U S  nuclear unit Westinghouse in December   Unless it closes a deal by March  a gaping balance sheet hole will prompt automatic delisting of its shares from Tokyo s stock market   further battering its shareholders  As questions emerge around the role of South Korean rival SK Hynix in the preferred bidder group  some Toshiba executives and officials at the company s main creditor banks say they want top management to look at other options   Toshiba hastily picked the consortium ahead of its  June 28  annual shareholders meeting  but more and more flaws are emerging as time passes   said a senior official at one of Toshiba s banks  SK Hynix  which was initially included just to help fund the deal  is now looking to own equity in Toshiba s chips unit  according to sources  raising antitrust and national concerns in Japan  SK Hynix has not commented  Addressing concerns that its chip technology could be handed to a foreign rival  Toshiba said previously that SK Hynix would have no equity or management influence  Scrapping that deal would leave one obvious option  rival suitor  Western Digital   NASDAQ WDC   which bid for the chip business with private equity firm KKR  But Western Digital  already a Toshiba joint venture partner  is in a legal dispute with the Japanese firm  and sources describe a deep distrust  But Western Digital could have the support of government backed Development Bank of Japan  DBJ  and Innovation Network Corp of Japan  INCJ    both currently part of the preferred buyer consortium   the sources said  They are said to be wary of SK Hynix  and of Toshiba agreeing a sale to the group while Western Digital has sought an injunction to stop it   If asked  we are ready to team up with Western Digital and KKR  and we actually prefer that   said a senior official at one of the government investors  Both the DBJ and INCJ declined to comment   A Toshiba spokesman said the firm is negotiating with the preferred buyer consortium to sign a definitive agreement as soon as possible  Selling other assets seems a less likely avenue  as Toshiba has few of sufficient value  and a piecemeal process could take too long   It sold its medical equipment business to Canon Inc for  6 billion last year  There are plans to list Toshiba s smart meter business Landis Gyr  but that will not plug the gap  Toshiba turned down offers from buyout group CVC and industrial conglomerate Hitachi to buy the business for almost  2 billion earlier this year  sources have said  Toshiba cannot raise cash by issuing shares because of restrictions imposed by the bourse after the 2015 scandal  DEAL OR NO DEAL Toshiba has been scrambling for cash for months   since it shocked investors late last year with news of the cost overruns and delays at Westinghouse  which forced a hefty writedown and losses  Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in March in one of the nuclear industry s most costly collapses to date  leaving Toshiba to cover  6 billion of liabilities it guaranteed  Even so  investors and some creditors say they fear Toshiba may simply refuse to consider what appears to be the most obvious option   Some within Toshiba say they d rather die than be  acquired by  Western Digital   said a banking official who has discussed the deal with senior Toshiba executives  Western Digital is a recent partner for Toshiba   it bought SanDisk  Toshiba s memory chip business partner for 17 years  in May last year  A leap from joint venture partner to buyer would have to overcome significant distrust   Last month  Western Digital sought a U S  court injunction to prevent a sale of Toshiba s chips arm without its consent   We worked with SanDisk over more than 10 years  but it s been just one year that we ve worked with Western Digital executives  and we ve had no good experience from it   a senior Toshiba executive said  Two people familiar with the matter said Toshiba believes that even if the court grants the injunction  it can proceed with a chip sale agreement   so long as it holds off completion  U S  chipmaker Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Ltd  previously considered a major candidate with a  20 billion offer for the Toshiba chips arm  backed off due to legal risks involving Western Digital

Ferri industrial SSDs  this segment accounted for almost one third of total revenues Rebounding orders from the company s NAND flash partners and increase in NAND supply led to a reduction in SSD prices  eventually leading to higher revenues  Sales for SSD controllers grew 15  quarter over quarter due to introduction of several new programs with the company s flash partners Revenues from eMMC

101188,322703,AVGO,Japan urges Toshiba  Western Digital to get along as chip spat flares,news,"By Ami Miyazaki and Taiga Uranaka
TOKYO  Reuters    Japan s government said on Tuesday it wanted Toshiba Corp  T 6502  and partner  Western Digital  Corp  O WDC  to cooperate  expressing concern about an escalating dispute between the two that threatens to upend the sale of Toshiba s chip unit 
Western Digital sought international arbitration this week to stop Toshiba from selling the unit without its consent  arguing that the Japanese conglomerate has violated contracts relating to their joint venture that operates Toshiba s main semiconductor plant   nL2N1IH00F 
On Tuesday evening  Toshiba said it would put on hold a decision to block Western Digital employees from the joint venture chip plant as well as databases  a threat it had said it would carry out if the U S  company did not sign a broad collaboration agreement that the two had negotiated 
CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa had said on Monday that he would make a decision on the matter on Tuesday 
 We are putting on hold a decision to limit access as we continue talks toward solving the issue   a Toshiba spokeswoman said 
California based Western Digital is one of the bidders for the world s second biggest NAND chip producer  but is not among the frontrunners after submitting a much lower offer than other suitors  a source with knowledge of the matter has said 
 It s very important for Toshiba and Western Digital to cooperate  Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters at a regular briefing on Tuesday  although he added that the ministry did not intend to intervene in the dispute 
His comments come after media reports that one of the proposed deals under discussion among government circles is to have the chip unit   which is valued by Toshiba at at least  18 billion   brought under control of the state backed Innovation Corporation of Japan  INCJ  fund 
INCJ and U S  private equity firm KKR   Co LP  N KKR  are widely expected to be the main players in a consortium which will take part in a second round of bidding 
However  some INCJ officials are cautious about making a large scale deal  sources familiar with the matter said  declining to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter  The fund has just 1 trillion yen   8 8 billion  in its war chest for acquisitions and investment 
The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that some senior members in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s administration have privately discussed offering up to  8 billion in government loan guarantees to support an INCJ KKR bid 
Japan government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said  however  that there was no truth to the report  A spokeswoman for INCJ declined to comment 
Shares in Toshiba  which is depending on the sale of the chip unit to cover billions in dollars in cost overruns at its now bankrupt U S  nuclear unit Westinghouse  slid to end down 12 percent  The cost of insuring against default for Toshiba s five year yen debt rose 10 basis points 
 While we believe that the successful sale of its chip business is indispensable for Toshiba to remain a going concern  hurdles to realizing such a goal are increasing   said Masako Kuwahara  a senior analyst at Moody s Investors Service

101245,322760,AVGO,Bond investor resistance movement may not last,news,"By Shankar Ramakrishnan  Will Caiger Smith and Natalie Harrison
NEW YORK  IFR    A revolt by bond buyers has slowed the recent trend of issuer friendly deals  but market participants say that will not last without big changes to the way investors scrutinize new deals 
Several issuers scrapped controversial terms in deals last month after investors refused to buy them unless they were removed   and the furor is still a hot topic weeks later 
Some described the scale of dissent as unprecedented   but investors clearly thought enough was enough and won the battle 
 There is a huge change in mindset among new issue buyers who have been buying billions of dollars worth of bonds in the last few years without raising any fuss   said Adam Cohen  founder of research firm Covenant Review 
Covenant Review  set up in 2006  focuses on bond and loan covenants and provides institutional investors with perspectives on their rights as bondholders 
Cohen  a corporate finance lawyer  brought the new covenant change to the attention of the buyside and urged investors not to buy the deals unless the terms were taken out  That triggered the huge investor backlash 
 They  investors  are now drawing red lines and saying they won t cross them   said Cohen 
Companies such as Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   General Motors  NYSE GM  Financial and Fibria Celulose had to withdraw language from bond documents that would have spared them paying an expensive make whole premium in the event of a default triggered by several actions including a simple covenant breach or bankruptcy 
Marsh   McLennan retroactively removed language from its bonds as the backlash intensified 
Days later  investors were emboldened to push back in a bond exchange offered by Verizon  asking the issuer to add step up coupons after talk surfaced that it was acquiring  Charter Communications   NASDAQ CHTR  
It declined to do so  but investors tendered far fewer bonds than it had initially hoped 
Companies  for now at least  are hesitant about rocking the boat and bankers are being careful to engage the buyside early 
Discussions about possible new covenants that would protect issuers in the event of major tax changes  for example  have been ongoing over the past few weeks 
 There appears to be a bigger focus on covenant language at the moment from top institutional investors who have recently been flexing their market power   said Eddie Best  the co leader of the global capital markets practice at law firm Mayer Brown 
 It seems to be coming from a perception that issuers have been chipping away at provisions in bond documents which were considered to be standard bondholder protections and that  at least in some instances  issuers may have gone too far  
STICKING TOGETHER
Many are skeptical  however  they investors have the tools to remain as disciplined as they have become in recent weeks 
The buyside has limited time to read through hundreds of pages of bond documents due to the rapid fire rate at which bonds are sold   and that s unlikely to change in the near term 
 It s always hard to read every line in the covenant before you buy and there is a presumption that the indenture package is similar to the previous one and no changes are being made   said Jason Shoup  a senior analyst at Legal   General Investment Management America 
 Especially with IG bond packages  we are not really afforded the time to comb through them to the degree required  
They often have to commit to buying and prices  on average within just an hour or two after bonds are announced 
The Credit Roundtable  an investor lobby group  complained to regulators in 2015 that buyers were not given enough time to properly analyze new deals 
But the practice of buying and selling still didn t change 
The frantic pace of supply   the US investment grade market saw its sixth straight year of record issuance in 2016   and the rise of passive investors such as exchange traded funds and index trackers has also given more power to issuers 
 Investors are less discriminating in strong markets  so issuers can get away with more   said David Knutson  head of credit research for the Americas at  Schroders   LON SDR  
 As passive investors become more prominent  there is not as much active research going on or discriminating between a good indenture and a weak indenture  
OVER THE TOP
Many borrowers   and their legal counsel   still believe that they will be able to insert issuer friendly terms on the off chance that investors might not object  or indeed notice 
 There are instances when an issuer would want to insert a covenant in page 23 of the indenture  which probably was not that investor friendly   said one senior banker 
 We would advise against it  but they would insist on leaving in  and that if someone objected they would remove it  The deals would go through  
If investors want to have more say over the long haul  some say they need to be better organized in groups and pressure issuers to standardize covenants   a difficult thing to do when companies  credit profiles and overall businesses are so varied 
At the very least  issuers should highlight any changes in their traditional covenant packages in the risk factors of bond documents to make them more visible 
Best at Mayer Brown said issuers know they need to foster good relations with institutional buyers   and that some of the uproar was overblown 
 Recent covenants changes proposed by issuers are being framed as some sort of conspiracy against investors or a  war on covenants   said Best 
   But  these proposed covenant changes are just testing the boundaries of what investors will accept  ",2017-02-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bond-investor-resistance-movement-may-not-last-459561,459561

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Top Stocks With Impressive Net Profit MarginThe primary purpose of a business is to generate profits that can be reinvested in the expansion or utilization of rewarding shareholders  Net profit margin is an effective tool for the measurement of profits generated by a business Net Profit Margin   Net profit  Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Net margin helps investors judge the risk involved in an investment  Creditors also view it as crucial to determining a company s ability to pay off debts Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers lends the company a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective to analyze a company s performance And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please

101312,322827,AVGO,U S  stocks trade lower on worrisome data  Fed rate hike odds tumble,news,"Investing com   Wall Street traded lower after worrisome data on the labor market and services sector convinced investors to sell stocks and the dollar  while markets slashed odds on a rate hike by the Federal Reserve  Fed  
At 16 28GMT or 12 28ET  the Dow 30 lost 38 points  or 0 21   the S P 500 fell 9 points  or 0 40   while the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite traded down 26 points  or 0 58  
The May employment report showed the creation of just 38 000 non farm payrolls  far below consensus expectations for 164 000 
U S  futures sold off after the release and the dollar tumbled 
The dismal jobs report was followed by the weakest ISM non manufacturing purchasing managers  index  PMI  since February 2014 
Markets slashed odds for a Fed rate hike and  as the dust settled near midday stateside  Fed fund futures had placed the probability for a June increase at only 6   compared to 21  the previous day  while odds were down from 58  in July to only 37  
Indeed  the probability for tightening of monetary policy no longer crosses the 50  threshold until the November 2 meeting where it settled at 52  
There was however still some question as to whether the worse than expected data would really dissuade the Fed from returning to policy normalization 
The May employment data could be an anomaly based on a telecommunications strike and a drop in construction hiring possibly due to bad weather 
All in all  the data only sought to increase the importance of Fed chair Janet Yellen s next public appearance on Monday 
The Fed chief is set to give a speech on the economic outlook and monetary policy to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia on Monday at 16 30GMT  or 12 30ET  and it could be the final chance for her to signal her position on the future path of rate hikes before the Fed announces their decision on June 15 
Before the jobs report  Chicago Fed president Charles Evans indicated on Friday that two rate hikes this year would be reasonable if economic data continues to be favorable  However  Evans did say he saw a  reasonable case  for delaying higher borrowing costs until core inflation reaches the Fed s goal of 2  
Fed governor Lael Brainard was the first policy maker to speak after the employment data and warned that global risks warranted caution on returning to the path of policy normalization 
 Prudent risk management would suggest the risks from waiting until the totality of the data provides greater confidence in a rebound in domestic activity  and there is greater certainty regarding the  Brexit  vote  seem lower than the risks associated with moving ahead of these developments   Brainard said 
In company news   Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C  tumbled more than 3  after chief executive Mike Corbat warned that second quarter net profit will be roughly in line with the first three months of the year  25  below the levels for the same period in 2015 
Avianca Hldgs  NYSE AVH  soared more than 20  as United Continental Holdings Inc  NYSE UAL  and Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL  were named as possible suitors in a Wall Street Journal report that the Panama based air carrier could be sold

101354,322869,AVGO,Here s Why Investors Should Offload Pegasystems  PEGA  Stock,opinion,"Holding onto shares of Pegasystems Inc    NASDAQ PEGA   might not be a good option  Shares of Pegasystems have lost 17 6  in the past six months  underperforming the  rally of 17 1  

 
This Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock might continue to witness a downside  A key reason for this is the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year 2017  we have seen two estimates move south in the past 60 days with no upward revisions  This resulted in the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from 91 cents a share 60 days ago to its current level of 73 cents 
Lower Than Expected Results   Stretched Valuations 
The company reported fiscal third quarter 2018 non GAAP revenues of  179 81 million  which declined 2  from the year ago quarter and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  198 million  This decline was due to the shift in the company s recurring revenue mix Pegasystems Inc  Revenue  TTM 

   PEGA s trailing 12 month price earnings  P E  ratio is 111 74  while the industry s average trailing 12 month P E ratio is lower at 29 26  This implies that the stock is currently overvalued 
Intensive Competition  Unimpressive Earnings Surprise History
With increasing global foothold  the company has been adversely affected by foreign exchange rate volatility as well as intensive competition 
Moreover  Pegasystems failed to outperform the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 18 68  
Considering the aforementioned factors  it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio  at least for now 
Stocks to Consider
Some better ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NetApp  Inc  NASDAQ NTAP    NVIDIA Corp    NASDAQ NVDA   and Broadcom Ltd    NASDAQ AVGO    all sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

saying they stole secrets from two companies that develop technology often used in military systems  the Department of Justice said on Tuesday  It was the third time in as many years that U S  authorities have made accusations of economic espionage conducted on behalf of China  a sign that the United States is increasingly focused on what it has termed a top national security concern  The charges against the six could exacerbate tensions between China and the United States  coming two days after U S  Secretary of State John Kerry s China visit was overshadowed by concerns over Beijing s maritime ambitions in the South China Sea  One of the suspects  Professor Hao Zhang  36  was arrested on Saturday in Los Angeles after he arrived on a flight from China  the Justice Department said in a statement  The other five suspects are believed to be in China   Zhang and two other professors from Tianjin University were charged with stealing source code and other proprietary information from chipmakers  Avago Technologies  Ltd  O AVGO  and  Skyworks Solutions Inc   O SWKS   where two of them worked   Avago has headquarters in San Jose  California and Singapore  and Skyworks is based in Woburn  Massachusetts  Zhang  a former Skyworks employee  and others established a company  ROFS Microsystems  at Tianjin with secrets stolen from the U S  firms  prosecutors said  Calls to ROFS Microsystems went unanswered on Wednesday  Tianjin University organized an immediate investigation  an employee from the university s publicity department told Reuters by phone  He declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media    The current investigation is still under way   he said  adding that the school would issue an official response soon   State backed Tianjin University  which was founded in 1895 as Northern University  is China s oldest institution of higher learning  according to its website  The ruling Communist Party s Central Committee  a council of some 200 senior officials who meet about once a year  identified the school  as a national key university  in 1959  the website said  Prosecutors identified the other five suspects as Wei Pang  35  a former Avago employee and a professor  Jinping Chen  41  a professor and a member of the board of directors for ROFS Microsystems  Chong Zhou  26  a Tianjin University graduate student and design engineer at ROFS Microsystems  Huisui Zhang  34  who studied with Pang and Zhang  and Zhao Gang  39  who is the general manager of ROFS Microsystems  According to the indictment  Pang and Zhang met while studying electrical engineering at University of Southern California and took jobs as engineers at Avago and Skyworks  respectively  Both companies specialize in Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator  FBAR  technology  which is primarily used in mobile devices like cellphones  tablets and GPS devices  but also has military applications  Between 2006 and 2007  Pang and Zhang hatched a plan to start manufacturing the technology in China and met with Tianjin University officials  prosecutors said  In 2009  both left the U S  companies to become professors at Tianjin  nearly 100 miles  160 km

the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Top Stocks with Solid Net Profit MarginThe primary motive of any investor is to generate maximum returns  Investors are thus always on the lookout for companies that are raking in solid profits Net profit margin is the most effective way to measure a company s profitability  A proper analysis of the same reveals how well a company is run and the headwinds confronting it Net Profit Margin   Net profit  Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers lends the company a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective to analyze a company s performance The Winning StrategyA healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are the two most sought after elements in a business model Apart from these  we have added a few criteria to ensure maximum returns from this strategy And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other

101416,322931,AVGO,5 Top Dividend Stocks To Ride The Tax Reform Rally,opinion,"While a rise in interest rates might diminish the attractiveness of dividend stocks  these will still be in demand on optimism surrounding the biggest tax overhaul in decades  This is because lower corporate taxes will boost companies  profits leading to handsome dividends and in turn lead to outperformance of stocks with a history of year over year dividend growth Why Dividend Growth Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model  a long track record of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields  All these make dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely  This makes the portfolio healthy and safe  Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock  it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Top Zacks Rank  Stocks

list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Broadcom Ltd    NASDAQ AVGO    ESCO International  Inc    NYSE WCC    Stratasys Ltd    NASDAQ SSYS   and Western Digital Corp    NASDAQ WDC   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  4 Tech Stocks on Sale  Should You Buy for 2018 The United States Senate just passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  marking President Donald Trump s first major legislative conquest  The highlight of the reform is the slash in corporate tax rate from 35  to 20  that is expected to boost the bottom line of the companies However  the technology sector is unlikely to benefit much from the reforms owing to the fact that  it already enjoys several tax benefits and therefore has a lower effective tax rate  Citing S P Global data  Bloomberg stated   Among sectors  the 18 5 percent effective tax rate enjoyed by the group is the third lowest among U S  large caps  This was also evident from the sector s not so impressive run in early December 2017 when investors were moving their funds into sectors which had higher scope for gains  As a matter of fact  just after the Republican Senate passed the bill with a 51 49 majority on Dec 2 morning  the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLK  declined approximately 2  in next two trading days Nevertheless  we believe that the technology sector  which has been benefiting from increasing demand for cloud based platforms  growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence  AI  solutions  augmented virtual reality devices  and Internet of Things  IoT  related software is capable of  regaining momentum in 2018 In fact  investors also soon realized that the early December plunge across the technology sector is an opportunity to invest in stocks that were too pricey earlier Here are a few stocks that saw a decline in their prices in early December following a shift in investors  focus toward other sectors  But these stocks enjoy strong fundamentals and thus are well poised for growth Broadcom Ltd  is one such stock which is still available at discount compared with with Dec 1 closing price  We believe that the company has several driving factors  which can help it gain going ahead The company is benefiting from strong demand for its wireless solutions  The trend is expected to continue in fiscal 2018  Moreover  the upcoming launch of the next generation WiFi products is expected to be a growth driver for the segment  Additionally  Broadcom s focus on multiple target markets mitigates operating risks and lessens the exposure to volatility in any single market  Based on its expanding product portfolio  the company is well positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like IoT and 5G The company s Zack s Rank  1 and VGM Score of B are further testaments to its upside potential  The VGM Score

 Pick 5 Winning Momentum Stocks Using the Driehaus MethodOne of the most favored approaches for investors with a high risk appetite is the Driehaus strategy  Investors can pick momentum stocks using it to eke out satisfactory returns  The strategy was formulated by Richard Driehaus using the buy high and sell higher principle  Its success has helped Driehaus earn a place in Barron s All Century Team The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five and 10 year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Thus  investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns A Brief Note on Driehaus  StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In keeping with his insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term For the rest

101477,322992,AVGO,Buy These 4 Stocks With Excellent Earnings Growth,opinion,Regardless of whether it is a young company or a renowned corporation  unswerving earnings growth is the highest priority for the top brass of any organization  And why not  If the company doesn t make money  it won t last over the long haul  Consider a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you have earnings This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price  But  expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinion on factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm Investors  thus  should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Hence  it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates Screening Parameters In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions  we have added the following parameters Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only Zacks   Buys  and  Strong Buys  are allowed  With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating

current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks    Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero  stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week    Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero  stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks  The above criteria

101478,322993,AVGO,Zacks com Featured Highlights  Arkema  Nutrisystem  Gibraltar Industries  Broadcom And Willdan,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 12  2017   Stocks in this week s article Arkema SA   OTC ARKAY    Nutrisystem Inc    NASDAQ NTRI    Gibraltar Industries Inc    NASDAQ ROCK    Broadcom Limited   NASDAQ AVGO   and Willdan Group Inc    NASDAQ WLDN   5 Top Stocks with Powerful New Profit Margin Net profit margin is the most effective way to measure a company s profits  A proper analysis of the same reveals how well a company is run and the headwinds confronting it A higher net margin reflects the company s efficiency at converting sales into actual profits Net Profit Margin   Net profit  Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin as compared to peers lends a company competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on the net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective to analyze a company s performance For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment

101480,322995,AVGO,Pick 5 Winning Momentum Stocks Using The Driehaus Strategy,opinion,One of the most favored approaches for investors with a high risk appetite is the Driehaus strategy  Investors can pick momentum stocks using it to eke out satisfactory returns  The strategy was formulated by Richard Driehaus using the buy high and sell higher principle  Its success has helped Driehaus earn a place in Barron s All Century Team The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five and 10 year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Thus  investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns A Brief Note on Driehaus  StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In keeping with his insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term Screening Parameters Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of A or B offer the best upside potential   Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see     Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2   Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business    Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median  Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks    Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5   Positive EPS surprise indicates potential    Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks  High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend    Momentum Score equal to or less than B  Ideal for taking advantage of momentum with the highest probability of success  These few parameters narrowed down the universe of over 7 851 stocks to only 20 Here are five of the 20 stocks that passed the screen Copart  Inc    NASDAQ CPRT   is a provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services It has a Momentum Score of B and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 10 7  Beacon Roofing Supply  Inc    NASDAQ BECN   is a distributor of residential and non residential roofing materials and other complementary building materials It has a Momentum Score of A and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 6 4  Broadcom Limited   NASDAQ AVGO   is a global designer of a range of semiconductor devices It has a Momentum Score of A and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 4 5  Moody s Corporation   NYSE MCO   is a provider of credit ratings  and economy related research  data  and analytical tools It has a Momentum Score of A and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 12 9  Forrester Research  Inc    NASDAQ FORR   is an independent research  data  and advisory services company  It has a Momentum Score of B and an

1        Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc     NASDAQ PLAY   
Dave   Buster s is scheduled to report its latest earnings results after the market closes on December 5  Thanks to its unique arcade eatery style restaurants  Dave   Buster s was able to stick out in the struggling retail restaurant industry throughout 2016  But that momentum did not continue into 2017  and shares of PLAY are down about 5  on the year 
Heading into its report date  Dave   Buster s is sporting a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Our latest consensus estimates are calling for earnings of  0 24 per share and revenues of  255 38 million  which would represent year over year growth rates of  6 00  and  11 68  
PLAY has successfully surpassed earnings estimate in 12 consecutive quarters  but its stock has failed to respond positively recently  Rising labor costs should drag down profits  and a lack of international exposure means the company won t benefit from an improved global economy 
 
2        Broadcom Limited    NASDAQ AVGO   
Semiconductor giant Broadcom is slated to release its latest quarterly report after the closing bell on December 6  After its bid for Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  was rejected  Broadcom will look to prove to investors and potential takeover targets that its financial position is strong  Shares of AVGO are already up over 55  this year 
As we approach its report date  Broadcom is sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Paired with its Earnings ESP of 0 63   this strong Zacks Rank makes us feel more comfortable about its chances to exceed expectations this quarter  Broadcom has met or surpassed estimates in 13 straight quarters 
Based on our latest consensus estimates  we expect Broadcom to report earnings of  4 50 per share and revenues of  4 82 billion  These results would represent year over year growth rates of  29 57  and  16 64   respectively 
 
3        Lululemon Athletica Inc     NASDAQ LULU   
Lululemon is scheduled to report its latest financial results after the market closes on December 6  This yoga inspired athletic apparel retailer is still growing  especially in terms of brand recognition and popularity  but its stock has failed to generate much momentum  Shares of LULU have gained just 3  so far this year 
Heading into its upcoming earnings announcement  Lululemon is sporting a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   According to our latest consensus estimates  the company is expected to post earnings of  0 52 per share and revenues of  611 47 million  These results would mark year over year growth rates of  10 77  and 12 32   respectively 
Lululemon has surpassed earnings estimates in two consecutive quarters  and with an Earnings ESP of 0 12   our model shows that investors could be in store for another beat next week

101505,323020,AVGO,Bet On Tax Reform With These Dividend Growth Stocks,opinion,"With President Donald Trump closer to his major legislative move   the biggest tax overhaul in decades   investors have started chasing dividend growth stocks  This is because lower corporate taxes would boost companies  profitability leading to fatty dividends and in turn benefit stocks having a history of dividend growth year over year Why Dividend Growth Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model  a long track record of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields  All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely  This makes the portfolio healthy and safe  Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock  it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Top Zacks Rank  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and 2  Buy  generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment  of B or better  Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated   NYSE JLL    This Illinois based full service real estate firm provides management services

101506,323021,AVGO,Sterling Construction  Cerner  Lululemon  Broadcom And Qualcomm Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Dec 7  2017    highlights Sterling Construction   NASDAQ STRL   as the Bull of the Day and Cerner Corporation   NASDAQ CERN   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on the Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU    Broadcom   NASDAQ AVGO   and Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Sterling Construction is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has a  B  for the growth style score   Being the aggressive growth stock strategist I like to see  A  for growth but I don t always get what I want   Sometimes I get more than what I want which is why this stock is the Bull of the Day DescriptionSterling Construction Company  Inc   together with its subsidiaries  operates as a heavy civil construction company in Texas  Utah  Nevada  Colorado  Arizona  California  Hawaii  and other states in theUS  The company builds  repairs  and reconstructs transportation infrastructure projects  including highways  roads  bridges  airfields  Sterling Construction Company  Inc  was founded in 1955 and is headquartered in The Woodlands  Texas Recent EarningsOn October 30  the company reported EPS of  0 26 when  0 22 was expected  It was the third consecutive beat of the Zacks Consensus estimate and good for an 18  positive earnings surprise  Revenues were sharply higher than expected   The company posted sales of  304M when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for  262M   That  42M difference translates to a 16  positive revenue surprise Importantly  the company guided higher as well in moving the revenue range from between  850M    880M to  915M to  935M when the consensus was calling for  875M Stocks that beat and then raise guidance have the best chance of seeing a post earnings drift higher Estimate RevisionsOver the last several months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been moving higher  Back in July  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 was sitting at  0 36 but bumped up to  0 39 in August  By October the number was up to  0 44 and we are currently at  0 45   Those are all positive moves in the right direction The 2018 number hasn t seen as much movement  It was  0 96 back in May and moved to  0 98 in October and that has been the only movement   Still  that number implies some very strong earnings growth for next year ValuationAs noted above  the earnings growth for next year is more than 100     well 119  to be exact  so you are going to have to pay for that kind of earnings growth   The forward PE for STRL is 38x and that is more than double the industry average of 16x   The price to book multiple of 3 2x is only slightly higher than the 2 8x industry average   Finally  the price to sales multiple of 0 5x is well below the industry average of 0 9x  Cerner Corporation recently missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and that led to analysts lowering future earnings estimates   When that happens  the Zacks Rank falls  and now as a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  CERN is the Bear of the Day DescriptionCerner Corporation is contributing to the systemic change of health and care delivery  For more than 30 years Cerner has been executing its vision to make health care safer and more efficient  Leveraging the experience of more than three decades in clinical information systems  Cerner is building on the knowledge that is in the system to support evidence based clinical decisions  prevent medical errors and empower patients in their care The company offers Cerner Millennium architecture  which includes clinical  financial  and management information systems that allow providers to access an individual s electronic health record at the point of care  and organizes and delivers information for physicians  nurses  laboratory technicians  pharmacists  front  and back office professionals  and consumers Earnings HistoryThe most recent report was a miss  but it was only 1 cent   Prior to that  there were two meets and one beat out of the last four reports   To me  that looks OK  and is not enough to become a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Estimates RevisionsThe detailed estimates page shows me that there have been a ton of negative revisions over the last 60 days  This is the reason the stock is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Additional Content Fresh Earnings Beats from AVGO  LULUJust when you thought earnings season was over  shares of both Lululemon and Broadcom are up in late trading today following their

101510,323025,AVGO,Zacks com Highlights  Jones Lang LaSalle  Broadcom  Rockwell Collins  Lam Research And Home Depot,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Dec 8  2017   Stocks in this week s article include  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc    NYSE JLL    Broadcom Ltd    NASDAQ AVGO    Rockwell Collins  Inc    NYSE COL    Lam Research Corp    NASDAQ LRCX   and The Home Depot Inc    NYSE HD   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Bet on Tax Reform with These Dividend Growth StocksWith President Donald Trump closer to his major legislative move   the biggest tax overhaul in decades   investors have started chasing dividend growth stocks  This is because lower corporate taxes would boost companies  profitability leading to fatty dividends and in turn benefit stocks having a history of dividend growth year over year Why Dividend Growth Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model  a long track record of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields  All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely  This makes the portfolio healthy and safe  Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock  it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields And that s what we re screening for today For

101543,323058,AVGO,Top Stock Reports For Estee Lauder  Broadcom   General Dynamics ,opinion,"Tuesday  November 28  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Estee Lauder  EL   Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   AVGO  and General Dynamics  GD   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Strong Buy rated Estee Lauder s shares are up  59 2  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks Cosmetics industry  which is up  11 8  over the same period  gaining from its solid focus on buyouts and product launches  strength in emerging markets and robust online business  Driven by these efforts  Estee Lauder marked its 13th and 3rd straight earnings and sales beat  respectively in first quarter fiscal 2018  wherein both top and bottom lines grew year over year  
Results were aided by contributions from BECCA and Too Faced  Moreover  the company witnessed strength across nearly all regions and product categories  with skin care and China standing out  Growth in travel retail and online channels also remained strong  
Management expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry  which encouraged it to raise its outlook  However  soft retail traffic in the United States remains a hurdle  Also  management remains cautious about other economic and political issues that can affect consumer spending 
 You can   
Shares of Buy rated Broadcom have handily beaten the technology sector as well as the red hot semiconductor space in the year to date period  gaining  61   The company is benefiting from strong demand of its wireless solutions  which is expected to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter  Broadcom now expects fourth quarter revenue growth to be in the double digit range on a year over year basis  much similar to the second and third quarter 
However  gross margin is expected to contract slightly due to unfavorable product mix  higher mix of low margin wireless business   The company recently completed the long pending Brocade acquisition  which is positive for the stock  
Moreover  the company made an unsolicited bid for Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   which was rejected  Nevertheless  the company intends to pursue the Qualcomm deal more aggressively and is also planning to redomicile in the United States 
 You can   
General Dynamics  shares have gained  14 8  over the last one year  underperforming the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  which increased  29 5  over the same period  However  the company s diverse portfolio of products and services along with its wide customer base provides it with an opportunity to generate solid revenues from different sources  
General Dynamics is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear powered submarines  Moreover  the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill  which includes provisions to spend  6 billion on Navy shipbuilding  will surely boost the company s growth trajectory  
However  the company operates in a highly competitive market and has to rely on other companies to provide materials  components and subsystems for its products  It also faces foreign currency fluctuations

Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Roche  RHHBY   Carnival  LON CCL   CCL  and Barclays  LON BARC   BCS  
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research 
It s not the one you think

101544,323059,AVGO,Dow Keeps Rallying As Tech Sells Off ,opinion,"The major indices took very different paths on Wednesday  The Dow continued to rally and finished at another all time high  but the NASDAQ was in full  tech wreck  mode with a sharp dip of more than 1   Tech has been a great driver for the market and came through with some great earnings just about a month ago   said Brian Bolan in Home Run Investor   When you couple great earnings and a pullback a month later  you get one thing    a buying opportunity  
	The NASDAQ plunged by 1 27  today to 6824 4  However  the Dow advanced 0 44  to 23 940 7  thanks in part to optimism that the Senate will be able to pass tax reform this week  possibly as early as tomorrow   The S P finished right in between its counterparts with a slight dip of 0 04  to 2626 1 
	Brian wasn t kidding when he said today s tech slump was a buying opportunity  The editor bought a beaten down software company in Home Run Investor on Wednesday  but first he sold a position for a double digit return  Surprise Trader added two companies that are both reporting one week from today  while Kevin added to one of his favorite positions in TAZR Trader  Learn about these moves and more in the highlights section below  Today s Portfolio Highlights  Surprise Trader  The NASDAQ s selloff today offered Dave a great opportunity to buy a 12 5  allocation in Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   which made big news recently with its unsolicited bid for Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   Meanwhile  the editor already proved that he s not afraid of retail when he picked up Zumiez a little over a week ago  Today he went further still with a 12 5  allocation in American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO   which is a high risk high reward selection that s been surging in November  Both of these companies report next Wednesday  Read the full write up for more on these moves TAZR Trader  When Kevin sold half of NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  earlier this month for a 19  return  he mentioned that he would be looking for a good reason to add those shares back  Well  today s NASDAQ selloff pulled the stock beneath  200 and the SOX index gave him the  pause and refresh  to the 50 day he called for in last night s commentary  For a NVDA superfan like Kevin  this was more than enough reason to add back to the position  Therefore  he sold some shares of AMD on Wednesday and used the proceeds to buy more NVDA  Read the full write up for the specifics Home Run Investor  Today s tech sell off prompted Brian Bolan to make a move today  But first  he needed to raise some cash to make the purchase  Therefore  he sold Euronet  EEFT  for a more than 33  return  The profit was used to pick up Cloudera  CLDR   a business software developer that dropped more than 5  today  The stock is well off its highs and will be reporting on December 7  The editor thinks this stock will soon make up all of today s losses and then some  Read the complete commentary for a lot more detail on this new buy Counterstrike   What I thought was odd was the aggressive selling in the Nasdaq names off the open  I was long NFLX overnight so that really beat me up bad as the stock continued to fall all morning  However  the S P held up  and retail was actually really strong  So there was very confusing price action that was focused on selling tech  but buying everything else  Retail was the strongest sector  but money was flowing into industrials  energy and financials as well  This was enough to support the market even with Nasdaq getting smashed 
	 The aggressive selling today was not ideal if you were long a tech name or a crypto currency  However  nothing else was really hit that hard  My goal over the next two days is to find a couple tech stocks to jump into 
	 I want to see if there is any follow through lower off the open   If the Nasdaq sells off like this again  there is a good chance that the rest of the market will follow  Patience is key as we don t want to get stuck in the middle of a larger sell off      Jeremy Mullin

101589,323104,AVGO,Oil Rush  Broadcom Attempts Merger With Qualcomm,opinion,"Everything is made in China these days     even Bitcoin 
Even though  have been officially eradicated from the country in September and most bitcoin exchanges have moved offshore  bitcoin mining is still done primarily in the world s big exporter of stuff 
A quick look at the network s main miners confirms    

The top six biggest mining pools from Antpool  blue  to BTCC  red  are all largely based in China  Some rough estimates put China s hashpower at more than 80  of the total network 
Of course  their main rival will have none of that  The Japanese City of Kazuno has launched a campaign to attract cryptocurrency miners 
Not only is Bitcoin legal in Japan  while its status is questionable in China  but the city of Kazuno has a lot to offer this budding industry  including an abundance of renewable energy and a picture perfect cool climate that computer s love 
Bitcoin transaction volumes along with the price per coin is reaching record high levels as more and more humans begin to wake up  but the energy it takes to power those transactions is not trivial  According to   a single transaction can take as much energy as your entire house uses in a week 
So we need to be mindful of how that energy is created

Market Overview
Two of the biggest news stories in financial media today could give us a hint about the current status of the market conditions 
21st Century Fox is trying to  of it s business to Disney  and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  seeking to take over Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  for  105 Billion 
The latter deal would represent the largest ever transaction in the tech industry and even though Qualcomm doesn t seem to be interested in the merger  Broadcom is preparing for a hostile takeover 
Huge merger deals have been a hallmark of a market that is flush with cash and has record low borrowing rates  It s a great way to grow an already large company and the banks are only too happy to lend to borrowers such as these 
As far as stocks are concerned though  it s very important that we note the cash holdings of investors in order to understand exactly how much more money is currently sitting on the sidelines and waiting to be put to work in this market 
At the moment Mutual Funds and Money Markets  running low   

However  this is only one indicator and just like we keep seeing with the VIX volatility index reaching shockingly record lows  it doesn t seem like we re in any way in a normal market 
Over to Korea
Today Donald Trump is in Seoul South Korea  I m sure you can guess the main topic that he will be discussing with Moon Jae in 
Though the Trump s wild rhetoric on North Korea differs from South Korea s more conservative approach  the US President s visit has been carefully scripted by some of his top advisors  As long as he doesn t deliver any surprise remarks or off cue quips  we should be good here 
Of course  the President is known for his unpredictability and even prides himself on it  In fact  just this morning he was called out for sending a tweet that undercut his own Foreign Policy Advisers 

The Saudi Situation   
Does seem to have caught the market s attention with the number one asset going berserk this morning is crude oil 

The breakout above  55 55  yellow line  was significant and so far this morning it seems that market exuberance and momentum are taking hold 
This comes much to the delight of OPEC and other major oil producers who have been trying to push the market to these levels for the past 3 years  Perhaps King Salman really does know what he s doing

101590,323105,AVGO,Opening Bell  USD  Oil Strengthen As Global Equities Roar,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
Key Events
The crackdown on corruption in Saudi Arabia appears to have sent the price of crude oil soaring  The sweeping arrests on Saturday included 11 princes  three dozen senior officials  including the commander of the national guard  the economic minister and the kingdom s leading international financier 

Opinions on the move range from revolutionary reform  to high stakes power consolidation  to simply reckless  An event that involves so many influential individuals in such a highly restricted  religious environment is likely to provoke cleric fueled riots  Historically  this type of civil unrest in oil producing countries spooks institutional investors  making them fearful of an upside risk  So they hedge  which creates demand  pushing up oil prices  Naturally  speculators follow  adding their demand into the mix  pushing prices up yet further 
Global Financial Affairs
Though oil prices weren t a behind the scenes factor that led to Saturday s Saudi crackdown  nonetheless the commodity s price is clearly moving higher  This dynamic after multiple failed efforts by OPEC to rebalance the oil market  whose prices were suppressed by US shale production could now be assisted by the dramatic arrests in the desert kingdom  Yesterday  the price of oil reached an intra day high of  57 59  the highest point for crude since July 2  2015 

In response  energy shares rallied 2 29 percent in the US  leading the S P 500 to its 51st record of the year  The NASDAQ also hit a new high 
Chip maker Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  has made a hostile   105 billion takeover bid for rival Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  in what would be the largest tech deal ever  Technology shares rallied on the approach  offsetting weakness in telecom shares after merger talks between Sprint  NYSE S  and T Mobile US  OTC DTEGY  failed 
Eurozone Composite PMI indicated strong momentum at the start of the 4th quarter  boosting the Stoxx Europe 600 
It seems that the global economy is lining up to support record stock prices worldwide and in the US as both fundamentals and technicals point higher  The global economy has been on the rise since last year  the US economy bottomed during the summer and has been expanding since then  Corporate earnings have been positive  and the balance of supply demand is clearly tilted to demand  The icing on the cake  the last couple of weeks seem to have been the most muted for President Donald Trump 

This morning  positive earnings by Japanese companies  alongside a weaker yen  pushed the Nikkei 225 to almost 23 000  its highest point since January 1992  the result of investors rotating funds out of safe havens and into roaring equity markets 
Expectations of demand for electric vehicles  a China pollution crackdown and an outlook for economic growth spurred metals higher  boosting Australian shares to their highest in a decade 

The RBA highlighted confidence in the country s investment outlook  though the Australian central bank maintained its growth forecast  The Aussie dollar first rallied on the confidence but pulled back on the flat growth forecast 
New Zealand s new  center left government kept the central bank s existing inflation target  The NZD rallied in relief the new government won t predicate tightening on a higher target  However  the currency couldn t hold gains against dollar strength 
Up Ahead

China s October foreign reserves are released on Tuesday 
U S  consumer sentiment probably cooled in early November from a more than 13 year high  The University of Michigan s report is out on Friday

In the weeks leading up to the earnings release  the stock was in a trading range between  230 00 and  241 00  We are going to assume a purchase price at the mid point   235 50   Had we sold an   a typical 1 month return would be between 2    3  with upside between 1 2   We ll again take the middle ground and assume a maximum 1 month return of 4

A positive earnings surprise saw share price rise to  252 31 with 3 hours remaining until market close  Had we not sold the covered call  this would represent a share increase of 7 1  from purchase price   16 81  235 50   With 3 weeks remaining until expiration of the June contracts  we then check the option chain to see if we can generate a second income stream with an out of the money call option

The out of the money  255 00 strike generates a premium of  2 65  Let s feed this information into the multiple tab of the  
AVGO 3 week calculations post earnings report

The calculator displays an initial 3 week time value return of 1 1  with an additional possible 1 1  if share value moves up to the  255 00 strike by expiration  This now represents a potential maximum return of 9 3   7 1    2 2   
Comparison chart of AVGO and the S P 500 leading up to the earnings release

Stocks that we might consider for this strategy approach are those that are out performing the market significantly and have a history of positive earnings surprises  If we are willing to take the risk of a disappointing report  there must be a rationale for doing so 
Discussion
We never sell a call or put option when there is an upcoming earnings release  We may decide to hold a stock through a report and then write the call if the underlying is out performing the overall market and has a history of positive surprises  There is risk in a disappointing report even if past reports have been positive ones

101631,323146,AVGO,Buying Back Put Options When Share Price Gaps Up  AVGO,opinion,"When selling cash secured puts our position management skills include buying back the short puts under certain circumstances  These include situations when share price moves up or down dramatically  When share price declines below the breakeven  we start losing money  Our guideline is to buy back the sold put if share price declines by more than 3  below the strike  This article will focus in on scenarios when stock price gaps up  We will use Broadcom Limited  NASDAQ AVGO   a stock frequently on our  
AVGO from 5 22 2017 to 6 2 2017

On 5 22 2017 AVGO  Broadcom Limited  was trading at  238 00 and then gapped up to  254 00 on 6 2 2017 
Selling the  235 00 out of the money put on 5 22 2017

AVGO  Put Calculations
The  shows us that we generate an initial 25 day return of 2 62   38 25  annualized   The cash required to secure this put is  22 900 00 per contract
Charting the  235 00 put option from 5 22 2017 through 6 2 2017

Guidelines to buy back put options after stock price gap up
We automatically buy back the short put when the premium value declines to 20  or less of the original sale price in the first half of the contract and 10  or less in the second half of the contract  In the case of AVGO  the decline was about 6  of the original option sale price of  6 00 
Benefit of closing
The reason it usually makes sense to close in this situation is because we now free up the  22 900 00 per contract which can be used to secure another put position in the same contract month  If we can generate more than  35 00 per contract  this will enhance our portfolio returns

101658,323173,AVGO,Stocks Mixed Amid Persistent Uncertainty ,opinion,"Stocks Mixed Amid Persistent UncertaintyU S  equities finished out the week mixed in a choppy session  as a morning relief rally succumbed to the recent persistent uncertainty  Early gains came as political concerns seemed to have eased somewhat  with President Trump s top economic advisor Gary Cohn suggesting he will not leave his post  However  the highly anticipated speeches from Fed Chair Janet Yellen and ECB President Mario Draghi didn t offer anything new to remedy swirling anxiety surrounding global monetary policy  The US dollar fell following Yellen s and Draghi s remarks  but bounced off the lows of the day  and Treasury yields ticked lower  while gold was higher and crude oil prices were mixed 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  rose 30 points  0 1   to 21 814  the S P 500 Index added 4 points  0 2   to 2 443  and the NASDAQ Composite shed 6 points  0 1   to 6 266  In light to moderate volume  663 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 4 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil rose  0 44 to  47 87 per barrel and wholesale gasoline lost  0 01 at  1 62 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price gained  4 42 to  1 290 82 per ounce  and the dollar index  a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies  was 0 3  lower at 92 50  Markets were higher for the week  as the DJIA increased 0 6   the S P 500 Index rose 0 7  and the NASDAQ Composite gained 0 8  
Ulta Beauty Inc  NASDAQ ULTA  212  reported Q2 earnings per share  EPS  of  1 83  above the  1 78 FactSet estimate  as revenues grew 20 6  year over year  y y  to  1 3 billion  roughly matching expectations  Q2 same store sales rose 11 7  y y  just shy of the 12 0  increase that the Street had projected  ULTA issued Q3 EPS guidance that had a midpoint below estimates  while its revenue and same store sales outlooks were roughly in line with projections  For the full year  the company raised its guidance  Shares finished solidly lower 
Broadcom Ltd   NASDAQ AVGO  246  posted fiscal Q3 EPS of  1 14  or  4 10 ex items  compared to the expected  4 03  as revenues rose 18 0  y y to  4 5 billion  roughly in line with estimates  BRCM issued Q4 revenue guidance that was mostly in line with forecasts  Shares were lower as the company suggested some areas of weakness in its hard disk drive and data center segments that are fostering some concerns on the Street 
GameStop Corp   NYSE GME  19  announced Q2 earnings of  0 22 per share  or  0 15 ex items  compared to the  0 18 estimate  as revenues rose 3 4  y y to  1 7 billion  above the projected  1 6 billion  Q2 same store sales rose 1 9   versus the expected 2 2  decline  but its gross margin declined y y and missed the Street s forecasts  GME reaffirmed its full year EPS outlook and said it expects same store sales to be at the high end of its previous guidance  Shares fell sharply on analyst concerns about the lighter than expected gross margin 
Early look at July manufacturing demand show core orders grew 
July preliminary durable goods orders fell 6 8  month over month  m m   compared to the Bloomberg estimate of a 6 0  drop  and June s 6 4  jump was unrevised  Ex transportation  orders were 0 5  higher m m  compared to forecasts of a 0 4  gain and versus June s unrevised 0 1  rise  Orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft  considered a proxy for business spending  grew 0 4   in line with projections  and following the unrevised flat reading posted in the month prior 
The headline figure was driven by the volatile component of transportation equipment as nondefense aircraft and parts orders fell nearly 71  m m  more than offsetting a 48  rise in defense aircraft and parts  and following the prior month s 129  surge  Demand for computers and related products  along with electrical equipment  appliances and components led the rise in core durable goods orders  partially offset by declines in orders for communications and machinery goods 
Treasuries were mostly higher  as the yield on the 2 Year note was little changed at 1 33   while the yield on the 10 Year note decreased 3 basis points  bps  to 2 17  and the 30 Year bond rate declined 2 bps to 2 75  
Treasury yields came under pressure in the wake of Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen s speech at the Fed s symposium in Jackson Hole  Wyoming  Amid the backdrop of festering global monetary policy uncertainty on signs of steady economic growth but low inflation  Yellen offered little in terms of economic and monetary policy commentary  focusing on financial regulation  She pointed out progress in putting in place a regulatory and supervisory structure to lower risks to financial stability and achieving a stronger financial system 
Yellen added that any changes to post crisis financial reforms should be  modest   She did note that  substantial progress has been made  toward the Fed s economic objectives of maximum employment and price stability  The markets were looking for any clues to the possibility of another rate hike this year and if the Central Bank will begin the process of shrinking its behemoth  4 5 trillion balance sheet next month as most are expecting 
Similar to Yellen  European Central Bank President  ECB  Mario Draghi steered clear from commenting on future monetary policy in his afternoon speech at the Fed symposium  instead focusing on trade and tax regulations  The euro jumped following Draghi s remarks  adding pressure to the U S dollar  as the lack of commentary toward future policy only added to the recent uncertainty 
Europe gives up gains  Asia mostly higher as monetary policy eyed
European stocks relinquished early gains and finished mostly lower  with the euro and British pound gaining noticeable ground on the greenback after Fed Chair Janet Yellen offered few new clues to monetary policy at the highly anticipated Fed symposium in Jackson Hole  Wyoming 
Caution appeared evident ahead of today s speech by ECB President Draghi at the Fed s symposium  Bond yields in the region finished mixed  Germany reported Q2 GDP growth of 2 1  y y  in line with forecasts  and versus the 1 9  expansion posted in Q1  In other economic news  the expectations component of the August German business confidence report unexpectedly improved  while French consumer confidence dipped as expected for this month 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly higher to close out the week even as potential volatility boosting speeches from the Fed and ECB loomed on the horizon  while U S  political and global trade uncertainty festered  Japanese equities rose  with the yen extending yesterday s decline  and as the Asian country reported that national consumer price inflation rose in line with expectations in July  while Tokyo consumer price inflation for August came in hotter than expected 
Mainland Chinese stocks and those listed in Hong Kong rallied  with earnings results in the region boosting sentiment  while securities in South Korea overcame early weakness and ticked slightly higher 
Stocks avoid third straight weekly decline
U S  stocks rebounded from back to back weekly declines in typical late August subdued volume  Earnings season wrapped up with mixed results from the consumer discretionary and staples sectors  but Q2 remained on track to post profit growth breaching 9 0  and revenue expansion topping 5 0   Even as U S  political uncertainty festered  sentiment appeared soothed by reports of progress on tax reform and as President Donald Trump s top economic advisor Gary Cohn suggested he will not leave his post 
Signs of continued global growth likely buoyed the markets  with eurozone and U S  business activity reports from Markit showing expansion persisted in August  helping overshadow disappointing U S  existing and new home sales reports  Stocks showed some resiliency in the face of lingering global monetary policy as highly anticipated speeches by Fed Chair Yellen and ECB President Draghi came into focus ahead their September monetary policy meetings  The U S  dollar index fell back to lows not seen since May 2016 and crude oil prices continued to drop  while the Treasury yield curve flattened a bit 
Next week  low volume  politics and the geopolitical front will likely remain sources of volatility  but a robust back end loaded U S  economic calendar is poised to garner attention  headlined by Friday s August nonfarm payroll report  Consumer Confidence and the second  of three  read on Q2 GDP will get the ball rolling  followed by July personal income and spending data  while August releases of the ISM Manufacturing Index  final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and auto sales will join the labor report to close out the week 
The latest bout of volatility illustrates why investors should stay focused on the longer term  Risks for a more substantial pullback in the near term still exist  as valuations remain elevated  After a weak first quarter  U S  economic growth has rebounded  with an improving employment picture  tightening labor market  rising median wage growth  and a relatively healthy consumer  Even though past performance is no indication of future results  a prolonged bear market has never occurred outside the context of a recessionary environment  Looking at the Index of Leading Economic Indicators  LEI  from the Conference Board  there are no signs of a coming recession and the U S  economy is getting some support from the rest of the world 
International reports due out next week that deserve a mention include  Australia building approvals  China industrial profits  Manufacturing and non Manufacturing PMIs  India Q2 GDP  Japan household spending  retail sales  and industrial production  Eurozone economic confidence  unemployment rate  consumer price inflation and Markit s Manufacturing PMI  along with German retail sales and unemployment change  UK mortgage approvals and Markit s Manufacturing PMI ",2017-08-27,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-mixed-amid-persistent-uncertainty-200209698,200209698
101659,323174,AVGO,iFOREX Daily Analysis   August 28  2017,opinion,"The Dollar fell sharply against a basket of global currencies on Friday as investors understood U S  Federal Reserve s chair Yellen s lack of comment about monetary policy at the central bankers meeting in Jackson Hole as indication that another rate hike this year would be rather unlikely 
On the other hand the president of the ECB  Mario Draghi said indicated that the global recovery is improving  but also warned to caution in handling the changes in the demographics and its fiscal implications 
The data regarding the durable goods orders in the United States fell by 6 8  in July  which was below market expectation of a decline of only 6 0 
U S  equities  except for the technology sector  were slightly up on Friday  supported by high dividend paying stocks  as Fed s chairwoman Janet Yellen remained silent on the topic of monetary policy in a much anticipated speech 
The weak starts monetary data being published on Monday by the ECB with most important data published on Thursday  On Thursday the personal income and consumer spending data  as well as price index and jobless claims statistics will be published from the U S  France and Italy will publish inflation data that day and Germany and the EU will show the current jobless statistics 
On Friday in the Asian trading session China will release its influential Purchase Manager Index  PMI  data  which will also be released the same day by Germany and Switzerland in the European trading session  In the North American session on Friday the U S  is to show a multitude of possible market moving statistics as the Non Farm Payrolls  NFP   jobless claims  consumer sentiment and manufacturing sentiment will be published 
EUR USD
The EUR USD was finally able to breach the  1 19 barrier among weaker fundamental data from the U S   durable goods orders  and optimistic tones from ECB president Draghi to the current state of the economy 
Draghi was very optimistic on the global economic recovery at the annual central bankers  meeting at Jackson Hole  while his U S  Fed s counterpart Yellen was more concerned with regulating the financial industry in her speech and praised the restrictions set up regarding the tendering of consumer and business credit 
On Monday the ECB is publishing its current momentary supply  M3  figures as well as data regarding the development lending in the private sector

Gold
Gold traded slightly higher against the U S  dollar amid speeches by Yellen and Draghi and experiencing high volatility at the times of the news announcements while remaining mostly in its previous trading range 
The weak economic data  durable goods orders statistic  and FED chairwoman s Yellen speech added volatility  while the markets remain concerned about possible further escalations by Donald Trump s administration in domestic and foreign policy 
This week  from the 28th August  gold investors will first look at the resilience of the Euro zone as the ECB will publish private sector lending statistics and the monetary supply  M3  in the Euro zone  It remains to be seen what effect EUR USD breaking the  1 19 for the first time since January 2015 will have on Gold which is mostly traded against the U S  dollar

WTI Oil
Oil settled very slightly higher on Friday  even though market participants are concerned that Hurricane Harvey will disrupt refinery activities and thereby the reducing demand for oil  45  of the U S  petrol refinery capacity is along the affected Gulf Coast where the hurricane could cause flooding and power cuts leading to refinery outages 
Falling prices have again negatively impacted the amount of operating oil rigs in the U S  as according to the Baker Hughes rig count the number was reduced by four to 759 oil rigs this week 
The EIA will publish its oil inventory statistics on Wednesday where market participants will actually be able to see the first impacts hurricane Harvey made on the stockpiles

US 500
U S  equities showed a mixed picture after the close on Friday with the major stock indices being positive  except for the NASDAQ Composite Index  US Tech 100  which was slightly down amid losses in the healthcare and technology sector 
One of the biggest losers of the day was Broadcom  NASDAQ NASDAQ AVGO   which fell by 3 66  as investors were not fully satisfied with the financial outlook presented by the company on Thursday  On the other hand Delta Airlines  NYSE NYSE DAL  was up 3 54  as a market report indicated strong buy positions from company insiders in the last six months 
Equity traders will watch carefully how Donald Trump s administration will actually be able to implement their business friendly election promises in the next weeks   Important fundamental data will be published towards the end of the week

market cap gets you in the top 20   Clearly  the big boys have all reported  so we are seeing some stragglers coming down the line   One strategy is to intentionally be a straggler  and end your quarter a month later  or really start your quarter a month later  and that allows you the chance to get in the spotlight I see several names that I want to talk about for this week  so I am just going to give some quick hits on each one   Let s start from the top and work our way down AVGOBroadcom  NASDAQ      is the biggest company set to report and the Street is looking for  4 46B on top and  4 03 on bottom  The stock was weaker closing the previous Friday just below  245 and trading  240 that day   This past week has been rather good to the stock  running higher on Monday and Tuesday and finally cooling off a little on Wednesday  Despite the potential for iPhone delays  this stock should still get a lot of attention as it hasn t missed on top or bottom in any quarter for the past two years CRMSalesforce  NYSE      is the next largest tech stock set to report at  64B in market cap   Analysts are calling for sales of  2 52B and EPS of  0 32  CRM is also on a win streak  beating the bottom line number in each of the last five quarters while revenues have topped expectation in every quarter for the last two years  On August 1  Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  started coverage of the stock with an Outperform and  110 target   A few days later  Coatue Management  an influential hedge fund noted in a 13F filing that they owned 1 09M shares of stock   This followed some comments back in late June that T Rowe Price held this stock as its biggest position in one of its funds with the Portfolio Manager coming on CNBC to say that he believes the stock could double from here HPQHP Inc   NYSE      is further down the list but still a bellwether name in the tech space   Recently  Meg Whitman stepped down from the board as HP split in two  HPE is HP Enterprises and since the split shares have appreciated about 20   HPQ on the other hand is down 30  since then  and the buzz around town is that she might jump shit to take over Uber   As much as I am really a numbers guy  this one is all about Meg as the stock could recover is she is removed SPLKSplunk  NASDAQ      is a data center play and at  8B it is the 12th largest tech stock slated to report   Wall Street wants  268M on

PSTGPure Storage  NYSE      is a stock that I really like  Last quarter the stock rose 9 5  after a solid beat and continued to run after that   All told  for the week of earnings the stock was higher

101725,323240,AVGO,Can Voxeljet  VJET  Spring A Surprise This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Voxeljet AG   NYSE VJET   is slated to report second quarter 2017 results on Aug 14  after the closing bell 
The company reported a negative earnings surprise of 16 7  in the last reported quarter 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Over the past few quarters  Voxeljet has undertaken a host of strategic and operational initiatives to drive improvement in business  These actions are starting to take hold  as evidenced by the company s improving margin performance  We believe that improved operational execution will prove conducive to the bottom line performance for the soon to be reported quarter 
In terms of geography  we believe Germany and the U S  will continue to act as strongest revenue churners  To further ramp up sales  the company has been moving its systems team into the new and increased production facility in Germany  Voxeljet believes that this state of the art facility  which is equipped to handle demand of future machine generation  will supplement sales growth for the upcoming quarter 
Moreover  steady increase in the demand of 3D printing equipment in the U S  and higher demand for products in China are positives  Impressive market traction of Phenolic Direct Binding process is anticipated to be one of the major catalysts for the quarter  In addition  the company s large scale service centers across the globe  including the recently opened subsidiaries in China and India are expected to boost growth for the second quarter and beyond 
However  on the flip side  the 3D printing industry has been battling a widespread decline in demand for enterprise 3D printers over the past two years  For quite some time now  waning demand for printers has added to the company s concern  We expect Voxeljet s second quarter 2017 results to take a beating on account of slowdown in markets 
Over the past few quarters  Voxeljet has been suffering from delayed customer adoption rates  which in turn  led to a decline of order backlogs  Moreover  depressed oil prices  which have caused investment deferrals by clients  affected the company s oil and gas extraction equipment business  This apart  Voxeljet has to contend itself with strong competition  which often results in price cuts and lower profitability 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Voxeljet will beat earnings estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   for the company is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 10 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Voxeljet AG Price and EPS Surprise

   Zacks Rank  Voxeljet carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Though Zacks Rank  1  2 and 3 increase the predictive power of the ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Broadcom Ltd    NASDAQ AVGO   has an Earnings ESP of  2 57  and a Zacks Rank  2 
CACI International Inc    NYSE CACI   has an Earnings ESP of  1 83  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Atento S A    NYSE ATTO   has an Earnings ESP of  35 71  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

101765,323280,AVGO,Is ARRIS  ARRS  A Step Closer To Acquiring Ruckus Wireless ,opinion,"ARRIS International PLC   NASDAQ ARRS    leading customer premises equipment manufacturer for the cable TV industry   moved one step forward to complete its proposed acquisition of Ruckus after the exit of Ruckus Wireless  channel chief  Sandra Glaser Cheek 
In Feb 2017  ARRIS entered into a deal with Broadcom to acquire Brocade Communication Systems  Inc  s   NASDAQ BRCD   Ruckus Wireless and ICX Switch units for  800 million  The company plans to close the agreement in fourth quarter fiscal 2017  Notably  ARRIS  buyout came on back of Brocade s decision to close the acquisition of Broadcom Limited   NASDAQ AVGO   
In fact  we believe that the acquisition of Ruckus is intrinsic to ARRIS  plans to enter the wireless business 
Moreover  the company s Carrier Class Service Provider Wi Fi Solution  currently deployed by Mediacom  integrates products from vendor partners including Ruckus  Aptilo Networks and Benu Networks 
However  in an 8 K filing to the SEC made in July  Brocade agreed with Broadcom to refile their regulatory application with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   Consequently  both the companies are undergoing a CFIUS review  and also agreed to refile their notice to provide CFIUS more review time  given the transaction s complexity  Therefore  Broadcom and Brocade now expect the transaction to close before the end of the fiscal fourth quarter 
In fact  the exit of Ruckus Wireless  channel chief is kept under the close observation of many market watchers as a sign that the deal will close by the year end as planned  Whatever be the final outcome  we expect investors  focus to remain on the issue  going forward 
Price Performance
Shares of ARRIS have underperformed the Zacks categorized  growth in the last six months  The stock declined 3 6  against the industry s gain of 14 8  

 
Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
ARRIS has recently inked several deals to broaden its product portfolio  Also  the company reported better than expected earnings in second quarter fiscal 2017  However  customer concentration  foreign currency exchange rate risk and being a highly leveraged company remain added risks for ARRIS 
We believe these factors substantiates its Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see 
If you are still interested in the Communication   Components industry  you may consider Arista Networks  Inc    NYSE ANET    which is a better ranked stock from the same space  The company currently sports a Zacks Rank  1 and might prove to be a better choice at the moment

start  courtesy of broad based performance across most sectors  Although earnings growth is trending lower than in comparable periods  total earnings are likely to be on par or even better than the all time high achieved in fourth quarter 2016  It appears that the equity markets have dispelled the recent skepticism about President Trump s ability to deliver on his pro growth promises      As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  A Key MetricROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that

101831,323346,AVGO,Ride The Momentum Wave With These 4 Stocks,opinion,In basketball  when a player hits a few shots in a row  he is said to have a  hot hand   In finance  we call it  momentum  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift At the core  momentum investing works on the principle of  Buy High  Sell Higher  Thus  this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast moving train  without fretting about valuations or growth prospects  But why does momentum strategy work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason for momentum strategy to work  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will spring back to their original prices  On the other hand  many investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things gain clarity  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends  and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Also  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining remarkably robust and persistent ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s  This is especially important as academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  becomes known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes Obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play  Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  and we have devised a strategy that will help investors get in on these trades and make handsome gains Our screen will help you take advantage of both long term price momentum

101938,323453,AVGO,3 Top Ranked Growth Stocks For Your Portfolio ,opinion,"There are no certainties in the market  Even if your stock reports strong quarterly results  it s no guarantee that it will lead to higher share prices  Your best bet is to play the odds and Zacks has just the screen for you 
It may be a mouthful  but the  premium screen is a great way to find high probability stocks that have been outperforming and should continue to do so  Many of Zacks  best investment tools are in the parameters of this screen  Zacks Rank  1s and  2s  Check  Top 50  of the Zacks Industry Rank  Check  Zacks Growth Style Scores of As and Bs  Check  Plus  it also uses average broker ratings  positive surprises  favorable valuations and positive price momentum to round out its list 
Today we ve highlighted three names that have passed this tough criteria Huntsman Corporation   
This global manufacturer of differentiated chemicals was already impressing the market with its enviable record for beating quarterly earnings estimates  but it s in the process of taking a big step to becoming a player in one of the best ranked industries in the market  Late last month  HUN and Clariant announced a merger of equals that would create a leading global specialty chemical company with an enterprise value of about  20 billion with sales of approximately  13 2 billion and an adjusted EBITDA of  2 3 billion  Huntsman shareholders will receive 1 2196 shares in the combined company  known as HuntsmanClariant  for each Huntsman share  It is expected to close by the end of the year 
One look at Huntsman s history  you can tell that Clariant is pretty good at picking partners  HUN has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for nine straight quarters now  and in 14 out of the last 15 quarters  Most recently  it reported 57 cents per share in its first quarter  which was 50  better than the 38 cent estimate  The company has amassed an average surprise of more than 20 1  over the past four quarters  Revenues improved by nearly 5  from last year to  2 47 billion  which was also ahead of our expectations at  2 45 billion as nearly all business segments outperformed  HUN is still planning to IPO its Pigments and Additives business  known as Venator  this summer 
The past two months have seen four of the five covering analysts raise their expectations on HUN  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year has climbed 17 2  in that time to  2 18 per share  Before the merger was announced  earnings estimates for 2018 had jumped nearly 16  to  2 47  which also suggested growth of more than 13  over 2017 
 Huntsman Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Ltd    
This semiconductor device supplier continues to benefit from the synergies of its merger with Avago in 2015  The company remains very active in the M A space and is in the process of acquiring Brocade in a deal that should be concluded by the end of next month  AVGO s expanding portfolio will be one of its main catalysts moving forward  since its increasing breadth mitigates operating risks and lessens exposure to any single market  AVGO is likely to continue driving profitability from such moves  especially Avago  for the foreseeable future  which was on full display in its fiscal second quarter report from early this month 
Earnings per share reached  3 31 in the quarter  or about 9 6  better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate at only  3 02  It has now surprised for 12 straight quarters and has only missed once in the past 5 years  The four quarter average beat is around 6 7   Revenue of  4 19 billion was 18  better than last year and a bit ahead of Zacks expectations at  4 105 billion  Looking toward FQ3  AVGO expects revenues of about  4 45 billion  or 6  better than the sequential quarter  For the rest of this fiscal year  top line growth is expected to be driven by seasonal strength in broadband access and sustained spending in cloud data centers 
Earnings estimates have enjoyed a nice bump higher in the past 30 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year  ending October 2017  has increased 6 9  in that time to  13 78 per share  Analysts expect AVGO s profit to improve more than 10  next fiscal year  ending October 2018  to  15 20  which has also expanded by 7  in the past month 
 Broadcom Limited Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Weight Watchers International  Inc    
Never underestimate the power of Oprah  WTW has been on a roll ever since the media mogul took a stake in the company and became its spokesperson  It has surged by nearly 200  this year  and reported a strong quarter last month that included positive surprises on the top and bottom lines along with a raised guidance  Next month  WTW gets a new captain when Mindy Grossman becomes the President and CEO  Ms  Grossman comes from HSN where she   transformed the HSN brand into a lifestyle network  launched industry leading digital innovations and formed unique and successful partnerships with leading brands and personalities   Now that the company has turned the corner  it s clear to see where it plans to go in the future 
Last month  WTW completed its third straight quarterly beat and this one was the most impressive yet  The company lost only one cent per share  but the Zacks Consensus Estimate was expecting a five cent loss  Therefore the surprise was 80   The average quarterly beat over the last four quarters is around 24 3   Revenues climbed 8 7  to  329 1 million  End of period subscribers were up 16  thanks to growth in all major geographic markets  But here at Zacks  we were most impressed with WTW boosting its full year fiscal 2017 earnings guidance to between  1 40 and  1 50 
For a well known company that s on the move  WTW is still underrepresented in the market  Nevertheless  earnings estimates are on the rise  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is only up 2 4  in the past two months to  1 28 per share  However  next year is looking different with earnings expected to jump from 2016 by 23  to  1 58  That s nearly 20  better than 2 months ago

101940,323455,AVGO,Paychex  PAYX  Q4 Earnings Top Estimates On Solid Revenues,opinion,Paychex Inc    NASDAQ PAYX   reported better than expected results for fourth quarter fiscal 2017  wherein the top and bottom lines  both  came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  on a year over year basis  the company registered improvement on both the counts The company reported non GAAP earnings per share of 54 cents  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and grew 10  year over year  mainly on the back of higher revenues Quarter DetailsPaychex reported total revenue  including interest on funds held for clients  of  798 6 million  up 6  year over year  Excluding interest on funds held for its clients  total services revenue  Payroll service and Human Resource Services  ascended 6  year over year to  784 6 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at  798 million Payroll Service segment revenues went up 2  from the year ago period to  440 9 million  primarily on the back of higher revenue per check and client base  Also  the acquisition of Advanced Partners contributed 1  to payroll service revenue growth Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 10  year over year to  343 7 million  chiefly driven by solid growth in client base and worksite employees  increased revenues from retirement  as well as online HR administration services Interest on funds held for clients increased 14  on a year over year basis to  14 million  primarily benefiting from higher average interest rates earned Paychex s total expenses flared up 5  from the year ago tally to  499 7 million due to higher wages and related expenses resulting from increased headcount in operations  However  total expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  contracted 80 basis points  bps  to 62 6  The company s operating income grew 8  year over year to  298 9 million  In addition  Paychex s operating margin expanded 80 bps to 37 4  Net income came in at  195 3 million  up from  178 1 million reported in the prior year quarter Paychex  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Balance Sheet   Cash FlowPaychex exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash  cash equivalents and corporate investments of  323 4 million compared with  403 9 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter  The company has no long term debt  It generated operating cash flow of  960 4 million during fiscal 2017 During the fiscal  Paychex paid  662 3 million as dividend and repurchased shares worth  166 2 million GuidancePaychex provided its outlook for fiscal 2018  Management expects Payroll Service revenues to increase year over year in the range of 1 2   while Human Resource Services revenues are anticipated to grow in a range of 8 10   Interest on funds held for its clients and investment income are now projected to grow in the mid to upper teen range Total revenue is estimated to increase by nearly 5   This translates to revenues of  3 309 billion  which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 36 billion Operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 40   Net income is likely to advance 5  year over year on a GAAP basis and 7  on a non GAAP basis Non GAAP earnings per share are estimated to increase in the range of 7  to 8  which comes to  2 35    2 38  The earnings per share guidance range is however  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 40 Effective income tax rate is now projected to be in the band of 35 5 36  Our TakeIn the fiscal fourth quarter  Paychex s earnings and revenues both surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  the year over year improvement on both counts was encouraging However  the company provided disappointing revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal 2017  The stock was down nearly 2 5  at the time of posting this blog  Notably  Paychex has outperformed the Zacks Categorized  industry on a year to date basis  The company has lost 3 7  year to date compared with the Outsourcing industry s loss of 4 9  Nonetheless  we are encouraged by Paychex s investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth  We also believe that the company s expansion initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support the long term growth strategy Product launches are likely to be the other growth drivers  Also  Paychex s focus on small  and mid sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities However  unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing   NASDAQ ADP   and Insperity   NYSE NSP   remain the primary concerns Currently  Paychex has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Another top ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Broadcom Limited   NASDAQ AVGO    which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see The company  which designs  develops and supplies analog and digital semiconductor connectivity solutions  has a long term EPS growth rate of 13 6   The EPS estimate for the current fiscal has been revised upward to  13 78 from  12 89  over the last 30 days Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks

101978,323493,AVGO,A Lazy  Unfocused Summer Is Here  Global Week Ahead,opinion,"This Global Week Ahead has a unifying theme    A Lazy  Unfocused Summer is here 
Yet that sentiment might be bullish stocks  No new news may be good news    in this upward trending market    driven by momentum  mostly 
The week s equity trading slate should focus on share price recovery  or the lack of one  in the FANG large caps  The sudden tech sell off wants to morph into a  buy the dip  event  Futures on Monday were full of green arrows  The S P 500 hit another all time high at the open 
Valuations got rich on the big momentum stocks in the tech space in 2017  Then  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  put out the early June warning that shot down these stocks from their dizzy heights  This Summer Solstice week will usher in the new big moment  We will see what the major trading houses conspire to next 
The published slate of activity shows a potpourri of macro speakers and macro data prints  There is no concentrated spot to point out  I list them by region below 
In the USA  Fed speakers get unleased on risk markets  Their self imposed silence ends from last week s FOMC meeting 
 1  On Monday  NY Fed President Bill Dudley  always voting  kicks it off  He hosts a roundtable in Plattsburgh  New York  Chicago Fed President Charles Evans  voting 2017  follows that evening  He speaks on current conditions and monetary policy 
 2  On Tuesday  Vice Chair Stan Fischer  always voting  speaks from Amsterdam in the Netherlands  This will be followed by Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren  nonvoting 2017  and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan  voting 2017  
 3  On Friday  Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester  alternate 2017  and St  Louis Fed President Jim Bullard  nonvoting 2017  get the final Fed words in 
In Latin America on Thursday  we get to watch  will Mexico s central bank hike again 
Consensus thinks there will be a 25 basis point rate hike  from 6 75  to 7 0  
Mexican CPI inflation may hit  6 6  y y  up from  6 3  y y in a prior reading  This inflation rise should be used to justify the new rate hike  Note  Governor Carsten moves on to the Bank for International Settlements  the BIS  in July 
In Asia on Monday  Chinese property prices get updated   Look for any tardy evidence of needed home price cooling   gratis tighter macroprudential measures 
 Macroprudential  means the measures are targeted to just this particular housing sector problem  not the broad economy  It s the latest fad in macroeconomic policy writing 
In Europe this week  Eurozone purchasing managers  indices  PMIs  and deferred comments by BoE Governor Mark Carney should be the big focus 
On Thursday and Friday  the European week ends with another EU Leaders Summit 
Reuters reported on a draft of the joint statement  It emphasized security and defense  anti protectionist trade warnings  and support for continuing the fight against climate change  Those are all in open conflict with the latest from the USA s new administration 
But more important  consider it an open message of European unity

101979,323494,AVGO,CAI International  Kroger  Broadcom  Regeneron And Vodafone Group Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 20  2017   CAI International  NYSE        as the Bull of the Day  Kroger  NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   NASDAQ         Regeneron  NASDAQ        and Vodafone Group  NASDAQ        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

	This morning I stumbled across some very good news for a stock we are currently holding in Momentum Trader  Well ahead of its earnings report  not due out until mid August  CAI International  NYSE        gave updated guidance for the upcoming quarter  Not only is it supposed to be good  but it s absolutely fantastic  A game changing report that could shoot this stock through the stratosphere  That s why I m naming it today s Bull of the Day 

	For those of you that don t know CAI  CAI International is a global transportation and logistics company specializing in intermodal leasing  rail leasing and operations  and global logistics services  As of the last quarterly update  CAI owned more than 933 000 twenty foot equivalent unit containers  TEUs   On top of its owned TEU fleet  CAI also manages additional containers totaling about 155 000 units for a total container fleet of about 1 09 million 

	Last quarter  CAI s net income was  5 3 million last quarter  The company estimates that Q2 net income will come in between  10 7 and  11 3 million or between 55 and 58 cents per share  That s right folks  CAI is set to double its net income quarter over quarter  Their current utilization of their fleet is up at 97 7  and the company estimates this number will remain above 98  throughout Q3  Nearly all their containers are expected to be delivered in Q2 and Q3  with all under leases with an average term over 8 years 

	Year to date CAI has already invested  370 million in new containers  with  105 million worth expected to be delivered in Q2 and  202 million delivered in Q3  With utilization so high and new containers already leased out  CAI also reached out to lenders to increase their loan commitment from  775 million to  960 million  This should help fuel a rally for several quarters to come 

	Even before this recent news broke CAI was a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   A big reason for the favorable rank was three analysts increasing their EPS estimates for the current quarter and current year  The bullish sentiment pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 29 cents to 43 cents and increased the current year number from  1 19 all the way to  1 87 

  

	The big story dominating the headlines last week was tech  The  tech wreck  on June 9th set the stage for a rough week for FANG stocks  Hidden among those headlines was a terrible week for today s Bear of the Day  Kroger  NYSE         The stock didn t just have disappointing earnings report  which sunk the stock dramatically  but it also found out it s now in a fight with one of the fiercest competitors on Earth in Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  

	In case you re not familiar with Kroger  the Kroger Co   together with its subsidiaries  operates as a retailer in the United States  It also manufactures and processes food for sale in its supermarkets  The company operates retail food and drug stores  multi department stores  jewelry stores  and convenience stores  Its combination food and drug stores offer natural food and organic sections  pharmacies  general merchandise  pet centers  fresh seafood  and organic produce  multi department stores provide general merchandise items  such as apparel  home fashion and furnishings  outdoor living  electronics  automotive products  toys  and fine jewelry  and price impact warehouse stores offer grocery  and health and beauty care items  as well as meat  dairy  baked goods  and fresh produce items 

	Kroger is the number one supermarket chain in the world by revenue  Thursday morning  Kroger s earnings report revealed  36 3 billion in Q1 revenues  up 4 9  year over year  The figure actually beat consensus estimates calling for  35 5 billion  However  same store sales dropped 0 2   prompting CFO Michael Schlotman to blame deflation and a heightened competitive landscape  They slashed forward guidance from a range of  2 21 to  2 25 down to a range of  2 00 to  2 05 per share  That drop in guidance was enough to take shares down 17  

	Making things worse was Amazon s announcement of its Whole Foods acquisition  Kroger was already reeling from price slashing competition  With Amazon now a big part of the competition  Kroger is really in some trouble over the intermediate term  Shares dropped another 9  as a result of the announcement

Lazy  Unfocused Summer Is Here  Global Week Ahead

	This Global Week Ahead has a unifying theme    A Lazy  Unfocused Summer is here 

	Yet that sentiment might be bullish stocks  No new news may be good news    in this upward trending market    driven by momentum  mostly 

	The week s equity trading slate should focus on share price recovery  or the lack of one  in the FANG large caps  The sudden tech sell off wants to morph into a  buy the dip  event  Futures on Monday were full of green arrows  The S P 500 hit another all time high at the open 

	Valuations got rich on the big momentum stocks in the tech space in 2017  Then  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  put out the early June warning that shot down these stocks from their dizzy heights  This Summer Solstice week will usher in the new big moment  We will see what the major trading houses conspire to next 

	The published slate of activity shows a potpourri of macro speakers and macro data prints  There is no concentrated spot to point out  I list them by region below 

In the USA   Fed speakers get unleased on risk markets  Their self imposed silence ends from last week s FOMC meeting 

	 1  On Monday  NY Fed President Bill Dudley  always voting  kicks it off  He hosts a roundtable in Plattsburgh  New York  Chicago Fed President Charles Evans  voting 2017  follows that evening  He speaks on current conditions and monetary policy 

	 2  On Tuesday  Vice Chair Stan Fischer  always voting  speaks from Amsterdam in the Netherlands  This will be followed by Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren  nonvoting 2017  and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan  voting 2017  

	 3  On Friday  Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester  alternate 2017  and St  Louis Fed President Jim Bullard  nonvoting 2017  get the final Fed words in 

In Latin America  on Thursday  we get to watch  will Mexico s central bank hike again 

	Consensus thinks there will be a 25 basis point rate hike  from 6 75  to 7 0  

	Mexican CPI inflation may hit  6 6  y y  up from  6 3  y y in a prior reading  This inflation rise should be used to justify the new rate hike  Note  Governor Carsten moves on to the Bank for International Settlements  the BIS  in July 

In Asia on Monday   Chinese property prices get updated  Look for any tardy evidence of needed home price cooling   gratis tighter macroprudential measures 

	 Macroprudential  means the measures are targeted to just this particular housing sector problem  not the broad economy  It s the latest fad in macroeconomic policy writing 

In Europe this week   Eurozone purchasing managers  indices  PMIs  and deferred comments by BoE Governor Mark Carney should be the big focus 

	On Thursday and Friday  the European week ends with another EU Leaders Summit 

	Reuters reported on a draft of the joint statement  It emphasized security and defense  anti protectionist trade warnings  and support for continuing the fight against climate change  Those are all in open conflict with the latest from the USA s new administration 

	But more important  consider it an open message of European unity

101982,323497,AVGO,5 Best ROE Stocks To Buy As Trump Faces Healthcare Bill Test,opinion,The equity market performance was mixed this week with continued volatility in oil prices and uncertainty shrouding the passage of the new Republican healthcare bill to repeal and replace Obamacare  Although President Trump expects the final draft of the bill to be relatively better  some conservative and centrist Republican senators as well as Democrats are likely to vehemently oppose the bill  As sublime tensions continue to raise an element of caution  investors are on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that will offer high returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  A Key MetricROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   AVGO   TOTAL S A   TOT  and UnitedHealth  UNH  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today  You can see 
Buy rated Broadcom s shares have handily beaten the technology sector as well as the red hot semiconductor space in the year to date period  gaining  43 6   The Zacks analyst likes the synergistic benefits gained from the merger with Avago  which will drive future profitability  Seasonal strength in broadband access and sustained cloud data center spending is expected to drive top line growth in the rest of fiscal 2017 
The company s divestiture of some of Brocade s assets to ARRIS International will accelerate the acquisition process and also lower leverage  However  customer concentration is a significant headwind   You can  
Shares of TOTAL S A  have outperformed the Zacks categorized Oil   Gas International Integrated industry over the last year  up  4 9  vs   1 0    The Zacks analyst likes the company s commitment to cost savings initiatives amid ongoing volatility of crude oil prices  After savings of  2 8 billion in 2016  TOTAL aims to save  3 5 billion in costs this year  Furthermore  it expects to improve its top line production by 4  in 2017  owing to new projects that have started operation this year

Donaldson Company Inc  NYSE DCI 



Donaldson  has been stair stepping higher for more than a year  It moved above the last stair two weeks ago and stalled  consolidating  Friday it started higher again though  The RSI is bullish and rising with the MACD moving higher  Look for continuation to participate higher   

FedEx  NYSE FDX 

FedEx  ran higher after the election in November  peaking in early December  It pulled back from there and has traded in a range ever since  The last move off of support stalled at the SMA s and pulled back to a higher low and now that has reversed higher  The RSI is on the edge of a move into the bullish zone and the MACD is rising and about to cross zero  Look for a higher high to participate in the upside

Up Next  Bonus Idea



After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which deep into the earnings season and with the May FOMC meeting and non farm payrolls in the books  sees equities looking strong again 

Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its downtrend while Crude Oil also is biased lower  but with caution for a reversal  The US Dollar Index is weak and moving lower while US Treasuries are also biased to the downside  The Shanghai Composite rounds out the markets looking weak as it moves lower while Emerging Markets are biased to continue to the upside 

Volatility looks to remain at abnormally low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   IWM and QQQ  Their charts all look stronger in the short term with the SPY and QQQ leading the way  In the longer timeframe the IWM is at resistance while the SPY and QQQ look set for a series of new highs  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Broadcom Limited  NASDAQ AVGO  218  announced fiscal 1Q EPS of  0 57  or  3 63 ex items  compared to the estimated  3 48  on revenues of  4 1 billion  roughly in line with expectations  The chipmaker issued 2Q revenue guidance that exceeded forecasts  Shares were higher 
Juno Therapeutic  NASDAQ JUNO  24  posted a 4Q loss of  0 51 per share  or  0 65 ex items  versus the projected shortfall of  0 62 per share  on revenues of  21 2 million  above the projected  14 6 million  Also  the company announced that it has ended the development of an experimental leukemia drug  JUNO traded noticeably to the downside 
Jobless claims fall
Weekly initial jobless claims dropped by 19 000 to 223 000 last week  below the Bloomberg forecast of 245 000  with the prior week s figure being revised lower to 242 000  The four week moving average fell by 6 250 to 234 250  while continuing claims rose by 3 000 to 2 066 000  north of estimates of 2 060 000 
Treasuries were lower  with the yields on the 2 year and 10 year notes gaining 3 basis points  bps  to 1 31  and 2 48   respectively  while the yield on the 30 year bond advanced 2 bps to 3 08  
The U S  dollar and Treasury yields extended yesterday s rally and the stock markets dipped from all time highs amid continued upbeat global economic data  which has fostered heightened probability of a Fed rate hike this month  Moreover  the markets appeared to react positively to President Donald Trump s first address to Congress Tuesday night 
The week s economic calendar will conclude with a couple key February reads on the all important U S  services sector  courtesy of the ISM non Manufacturing Index and the final Markit Services PMI Index  ISM s index is projected to remain at January s 56 5 level and Markit s index is expected to be revised slightly higher to 54 0 from the preliminary estimate of 53 9  but down from January s 55 6 mark  Readings above 50 for both gauges denote expansion 
Economic data has continued to beat expectations  but the number of upside surprises may start to level off  That doesn t mean things are getting worse  just that expectations are catching up with the improvements in the data  which could have a dampening impact on investor enthusiasm in the near term  However  ultimately  we believe fiscal stimulus is coming  although perhaps later than anticipated  and the bull market in U S  stocks will continue 
Europe and Asia mixed after yesterday s global rally 
European equities finished mixed  taking a breather from yesterday s global rally that was fueled by some upbeat manufacturing reports out of the region and the U S  and China  as well as cooled political concerns in the U S  on the heels of President Trump s Congressional speech  Earnings reports in the region diverged  and political risk on this side of the Atlantic continued to fester as a key French Presidential election looms 
The Eurozone s consumer price inflation estimate accelerated month over month in February  matching expectations and the eurozone unemployment rate remained at 9 6  for January  in line with projections  The euro and British pound declined versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region gained ground 
Stocks in Asia finished mixed on the heels of the global rally yesterday that took the U S  equity markets back to all time highs  Global manufacturing data  headlined by upbeat reads in the U S   China and Europe boosted economic sentiment  while Tuesday night s Congressional speech by Donald Trump appeared to calm political concerns in the world s largest economy  Japanese equities extended yesterday s rally as the yen added to recent weakness  Basic materials rallied in the wake of the global economic optimism  boosting Australian securities  which were further aided by an upbeat read on the nation s building approvals  though its trade surplus narrowed unexpectedly 
South Korean stocks advanced in a return to action from yesterday s holiday break  However  property related issued weighed on markets in mainland China and Hong Kong  Indian equities traded lower in a late day slide as the market retreated from its recent run 
Tomorrow  the international economic docket will include CPI and consumer confidence from Japan and services PMI reads for China and India  Across the pond  releases will include retail sales from Germany  GDP from Italy  retail sales from the Eurozone and Markit Services PMI Indexes for the UK  Germany  Italy  France and the Eurozone ",2017-03-05,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-exhale-after-breathing-fresh-gains-yesterday-200177738,200177738
102125,323640,AVGO,Stock Market Today  Slow Price Action But Trend Line Holds,opinion,"Slow Price action but trend line holds
This trend line off of the November lows continues to hold  That is great for the bulls  The price action however is really slowing down  Really  all the month s gains from an index standpoint comes from the March 1st rally  Everything else since then has been trapped inside of February s closing price and the March 1st closing price highs  That makes from some dull markets  I m still keeping one eye on the exit though as it is becoming a little more obvious by the day that the market is lacking momentum to push higher  Particularly in this month here 
T2108  which measures the percentage of stocks trading above their 40 day moving average  has improved over the last two trading sessions with now 49  trading above the MA  Still not great but better than the mid 30 s it was in back on Tuesday  USO  NYSE USO  continues to show signs of wanting to bounce  following the 7 day selloff  but the bounce itself  hasn t been overwhelming by any means  Gold also bounced the past two days in a fairly significant manner  Look to see if it can take out February s highs in the coming week

102126,323641,AVGO,SPX Coiling In On Triangle Pattern,opinion,"Short term triangle pattern on SPX
SPX has been coiling in a triangle pattern the past three weeks now  or essentially  this entire month of trading  It has pulled back to the rising trend line that forms the bottom half of the triangle pattern  However  it has only experienced a mild  light volume pullback over the past five trading sessions  and could easily bounce here and breakout of the triangle to the upside 
Watch for a move in one direction or the other and plan your trades accordingly  These light volume pullbacks that are extremely shallow  Check this out  The S P has finished down four out of the last five days  On 3 13 SPX finished the day at 2373 47  Yesterday it closed at 2373 47  Crazy  right  Basically  despite the market pulling back 80  of the time during that time frame  it is still at the same place it started  That isn t a pullback

102127,323642,AVGO,Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights  Broadcom  Applied Materials  Analog Devices And Lam Research,opinion,"For Immediate Release 

	Chicago  IL   April 13  2017   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Limited  NASDAQ           Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   NASDAQ           Analog Devices  NASDAQ          and Lam Research  NASDAQ          

3 Tech Stocks to Buy on This Pullback

	I told my followers in March to buy the decline to S P 2325 for a very simple reason  the pullbacks would be shallow because fundamentals were strong and fund managers were under exposed to the rally since November 

	Not only has the robust economic data been displaying a resiliency to any concerns about rising interest rates  but Q1 earnings are poised to deliver the highest profit gain of any quarter since 2011 
	And so that s why I ve also been stating that a test of S P 2300 has a good chance    say 2 in 3    of marking the low in April  At worst  in my view  a 6  pullback from the peak at 2400 down to stronger support in the 2250 75 zone is what we should expect from this market and its very small wall of fundamental and valuation worries 
	So  given this optimistic backdrop  what should investors do with ready cash  Two words  Buy Technology  This dynamic sector    which drives most economic innovation    is the least dependent on or impacted by any policy out of DC Prepare Your Tech Shopping List During April Showers
	I ve got a long list of technology names I m focused on across many industries from software and services to hardware and chips  And I m checking it twice a day to see which I like best and which are nearing my buy zones 
	Not surprisingly  many of them are in the semiconductor industries  So while I didn t intend for this to be an  all the chips  theme  it happens that three of my top Zacks  1 Rank picks are from that well of gushing profits 
	And even though the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  SOX  was up a blistering 12  on the year in March  reflecting large investor appetite for that growth  the run is not over this year  Any 5 10  correction should be bought because global technology cycles are still driving enterprise cap ex and earnings for computer and communications equipment of all kinds 
	As of Tuesday April 11  the SOX is up only 8 5  YTD and the buying opportunities are starting to pop up My 3 Chips for the Dips
	Here are three tech stocks each still possessing good upside potential in this cycle    upside that you can enhance by getting a good edge on your entry  I give  good edge  buy zones for each Broadcom Limited   NASDAQ         
	This  88 billion  arms dealer  to both enterprise wired infrastructure customers and wireless smartphone makers and networks is the most diversified  chip stock  of the bunch 
	I ve been recommending and swing trading AVGO since 2014 and  70  from where it has more than tripled  The stock has consistently claimed the top tier of the Zacks Rank every quarter as analysts keep raising top and bottom line estimates 
	In the middle of their Q2 of the current fiscal year ending in October  Broadcom is expected to grow sales by 28  and profits by 32  
	Buy AVGO between  200 and  210  And if the corrective action for tech stocks heats up  grabbing any shares near  190 should offer an excellent risk reward play Applied Materials   NASDAQ         
	AMAT makes semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and related spare parts for the worldwide semiconductor industry  Customers for these products include wafer manufacturers and semiconductor integrated circuit  IC  manufacturers  who either use the ICs they manufacture in their own products or sell them to other companies 
	I ve been writing about AMAT since December as a great Bull of the Day to scoop up in the mid  30s  Also in the midst of its Q2 of FY17  ending October   AMAT is projected to advance the top line by 22  and profits by 51  
	Buy AMAT between  36 and  37 for the best edge  More aggressive investor traders can begin building positions on dips under  38 Analog Devices   NASDAQ         
	Analog Devices is one of the world leaders in the design  manufacture and marketing of high performance analog  mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits used in signal processing applications 
	Applications for its products include communications  cellular telephones  computers and computer peripherals  consumer electronics  automotive electronics  factory automation  process control and military and space systems 
	On the same October 2017 fiscal year  ADI is expected to deliver growth of 42  on the top line and 32  on the bottom 
	Buy ADI between  74 and  77  On Tuesday  shares dipped just under  77 and are below their 60 period VWAP  volume weighted moving average   I expect more pressure until a test of support in the  74 75 area Bonus Play  Just One More ChipLam Research   NASDAQ         
	This Zacks  2 Rank is very similar to AMAT in terms of products and customers served  concentrating on front end wafer processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits  The company s precision products are used in different capacities to etch away portions of various films to create an integrated circuit 
	In the middle of its June fiscal year  LRCX is projected to produce revenue growth of 33 4  and an earnings advance of 46 6   Analysts at Pacific Crest recently raised their price target on shares to  163 while boutique investment bank Stifel Nicolaus hiked theirs to  150 
	Buy LRCX between  120 and  125  The VWAP is down just under  120 and I expect institutional buyers to be active well before then  We first bought LRCX on the last dip under  115 and are back in the shares now Bottom Line on the Chips  Obviously  you don t want to buy all 4 of these semiconductor stocks for portfolios of under 20 names  But 2 or 3 of them would be pretty smart for a stable of 20   I m certainly looking forward to the opportunities to grab some more chip exposure at attractive levels again

102160,323675,AVGO,The Week Ahead  Will Policy Uncertainty Increase Volatility ,opinion,"We have a normal calendar for economic data  There will be important news coming from corporate earnings reports  Since this earnings season is part of an inflection point   the end of the earnings recession  it is special  That said  the uncertainty over policy change has market observers both divided and on edge  I expect the earnings news to get less attention than normal  With the queasy  uncertain feeling  the pundits will be asking 
Will policy uncertainty lead to greater stock volatility 
Last Week
Last week the economic news was strong  but with little reaction from stocks 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted a close watch on earnings to see if these reports confirmed the improvement in economic data  There was plenty of attention to earnings  but not much on the economic strength theme  Pundits loved to discuss the various Trump appointees and speculate on the stock implications  At some point the market will refocus on the regular themes  For now   like it or not   the Trump effect is a big part of the daily discussion 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart of the S P 500 from   As has been the recent case  both the range and the weekly change were very small  Doug attributes the Friday pullback to an Inaugural Address that offered little for the wealthy  He offers more analysis in his commentary   Personally  I do not find any of the moves big enough to merit discussion  but there was plenty of commentary  

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
This week s news was again quite good almost all positive  I make objective calls  which means not stretching to achieve a false balance  If I missed something for the  bad  list  please feel free to suggest it in the comments 
The Good
Industrial production rose 0 8   This beat expectations of 0 6   but the prior month was revised lower by about the same amount  This series is difficult to interpret in the short run 
Philly Fed improved to 23 6 versus the prior month 21 5  This is an exceptional gain for two consecutive months in a diffusion index  It handily beat expectations of 16 or so 
Initial jobless claims fell yet again  The series is now at the lowest level since 1973  To my surprise amazement  some of the punditry is actually finding a way to make this into bad news 

Inflation is higher  I understand that many view this as bad news  At some level  it would be  At a time when deflation  more dangerous and harder to fight  has been threatening  a modest rate of inflation is preferred   has the story  and good charts on other data as well 


Homebuilder confidence remains strong    our go to source on all things housing  notes that the reading was  below consensus  but another solid reading   Anything over 50 indicates that most builders view conditions as good 
Housing starts showed a big increase  but mostly because of multi family  The volatile series remains in the range  predicted at the start of the year  4  to 8    The actual was 4 9   so the bottom end of the range  More encouraging is that multi family was down 3 1  for the year while the gains came from the 9 3  increase in single family 

The Bad
Building permits had a slight decline to a  of 1 210 000  This is down 0 2  from last month but a gain of 0 7  over last year  I tend to place more weight on this series than most other analysts  so I watch it closely 
Earnings season began on a soft note  Both earnings and revenue surprises are below the long term averages  Only 12  of the S P 500 companies have responded so far  and there is specific sector concentration  I ll save the charts until we have more data  but you can check for yourself at   Also  see from Avondale  which follows the conference calls 
The Ugly
California budgeting  I have criticized my own state  Illinois  so often  This week the award goes to  for a  1 5 billion  math error   Put enough of these together and you eventually have real money     
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  No award this week  I welcome nominations from readers  As always  ZH is a fertile source of ideas  Write something 
We also published our annual review of winners  If you take a look at the excellent work reviewed   and   you will see the advantage of following these contrarian sources  You will be surprised at how much it can help your investing 
There was a popular recent post about  neglected topics   The article highlighted the heavy hitters who basically control the agenda of what you see  I tried to respond   I despair  I welcome suggestions about how to get more exposure for those who do great but unpopular work 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar
It is back to normal for the volume of economic data  but fewer of the most important reports 
The  A  List
New Home Sales  Th   More strength expected in this important sector 
Michigan Sentiment  F   Continued strength anticipated  Special interest in future expectations 
Q4 GDP  F   The first estimate gets major adjustments  but still attracts plenty of attention 
Leading Indicators  Th   Expected rebound from last month s  No change   Some swear by this report 
Initial jobless claims  Th   How long can the amazing strength continue 
The  B  List
Existing Home Sales  T   Lacks the economic effect of new sales  but a good read on the market 
Durable Goods  F   More stable improvement when the volatile transportation sector removed  but headline rebound also expected 
Crude inventories  Th   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 
Fed speakers are still on the trail  Questions will probe the new political environment  with everyone trying to dodge 
Earnings reports will remain important  Early actions from the Trump Administration will capture attention  if only because few know quite what to expect 
Next Week s Theme
It would be nice to have a clean turn to our regular analysis of economic data and earnings  I understand that many  including my readers  are tired of thinking about the Trump Effect  I sympathize  but it is not a good investment strategy  We need to think carefully about what is likely to work  and what isn t  Since no one really knows what is going to happen  as I suggested a year ago   the current dubious pundit forecast is more volatility  That will steal the spotlight next week  The key question will be 
Will uncertainty about policy changes lead to more volatility 
The basic positions are simple 
Some see the new administration as negative for the market  and some see it as positive  This is frequently interpreted as more volatility 
There are several policies on a  hit list   How rapidly will policy changes occur  Higher volatility 
Some speculate that the Presidential Inauguration will represent a market top  The sources look like a list of serial top callers  but many are embracing the idea 
Various worries are somewhat offsetting  Extreme possibilities do not always lead to major changes 
President Trump may still prove different from Candidate Trump 
There are already executive orders  What are the implications 
What does this mean for investors  As usual  I ll have a few ideas of my own in today s  Final Thoughts  
Quant Corner
We follow some regular great sources and the best insights from each week 
Risk Analysis
Whether you are a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  Think first about your risk  Only then should you consider possible rewards  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update 
The Indicator Snapshot

Although dropping last week  the yield on the ten year note has increased significantly since the election  This has lowered the risk premium a bit  I suspect much more to come  By this I mean that the relative attractiveness of stocks and bonds will continue to narrow 
The C Score has also dropped  The relationship is not linear  and it remains in the  safe  zone 
The Featured Sources 
Bob Dieli  The  C Score  which is a weekly estimate of his Enhanced Aggregate Spread  the most accurate real time recession forecasting method over the last few decades   His subscribers get  including both an economic overview of the economy and employment   see below  
Holmes  Our cautious and clever watchdog  who sniffs out opportunity like a great detective  but emphasizes guarding assets 
Brian Gilmartin  Analysis of expected earnings for the overall market as well as coverage of many individual companies 
Doug Short  The World Markets Weekend Update  and much more  
RecessionAlert  Many  for both economic and market analysis  While we feature his recession analysis  Dwaine also has several interesting approaches to asset allocation  Try out his new public   the source of this interesting chart 

This illustrates the improvement in economic indicators   a consistent recent theme 
Georg Vrba  The  and much more  for an array of interesting methods  Georg  Bob Dieli s enhanced aggregate spread  considering when it might first give a recession signal  Georg has been suggesting that the measure still shows a one year led time  His most recent take has a wide time horizon  but an onset date of October  the chart below   Please note that Georg s other indicators are still  friendly  

The question is whether this improves over Dr  Dieli s original concept  which has worked for decades in real time  He is quite open to new ideas  and is constantly questioning whether anything has changed in the key relationships he studies  Even before I saw Georg s most recent work  I was planning to share this chart from Bob s regular monthly update  I regard it as the single most important current concept for investors of all types 

A costly investor mistake has been fear  often incited by those with little knowledge and no track record  Stay tuned

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be  of Broadcom Limited  NASDAQ AVGO   It combines all the many things that Chuck does so well   a great stock idea  a lesson in several types of fundamental analysis  and a tutorial on his first rate market tools  I usually do not like videos since I can read fast  In this case I recommend that DIY investors grab a cup of coffee and watch the entire video  While Chuck s tools allow for a lot of flexibility  his approach is very like what we use in screening our candidates  If you are not doing something like this  you should stick to ETFs 
Stock Ideas
Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  is  Permian Basin assets  on the cheap   This may not show up in an immediate stock price change  but it is something I have been expecting  Investors should understand the long term needs of big integrated oil companies  and the floor placed under reserves 
Where should you look   United States Lime and Minerals  NASDAQ USLM   Eddy writes 

Fourteen years ago  USLM was going for  3 per share  Today it s at  77  So how many analysts follow it  Zero 


The stock has a market cap of  425 million  I also have to say that I love that name 

Keep that in mind while considering  from Eli Hoffman  CEO and Editor in Chief at Seeking Alpha  Starting with a WSJ article  he carefully explains the motives of many analysts 
I feel quite strongly about these ideas  We NEVER use sell side research as the basis for ideas  In fact  it is a negative factor in our general rating system  Individual investors need a similar method  I also agree with Eli that Seeking Alpha provides plenty of grist for the mill  While I have my own methods for generating ideas  it is always a valuable checkpoint on the way 
Our trading model  Holmes  has joined our other models in a weekly market discussion  Each one has a different  personality  and I get to be the human doing fundamental analysis  We have an enjoyable discussion every week  including four or five specific ideas that we are buying   the dip buying Holmes  who has been very hot  liked Fomento Economico  FMX  a distributor of soft drinks and an investor in the Heineken Group  I objected  In an action of man over model  or person over dog  or boss over worker  I vetoed the trade  Holmes has gone to Mexico  true   for further investigation  We will be checking his expense account  FMX does not sell Margaritas 
Seeking yield 
How about Blue Harbinger s   Diversified Real Asset Income  NYSE DRA   This is another fund trading at a discount to NAV  I am always interested in Mark s well researched ideas and always curious about the reason for the discount 

Personal Finance

Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  If you are a serious investor managing your own account  this is a must read  Even the more casual long term investor should make time for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his  My personal favorite this week is the  about the six different investor personalities  There is a lesson in each 

Seeking Alpha Editor Gil Weinreich s Financial Advisors  Daily Digest has quickly become a must read for financial professionals  Somewhat to my surprise  the topics are also especially relevant for active individual investors  They frequently join in the comments  adding to the value of the posts for both groups  Gil has several good topics  but I especially liked this   I have started following the author  Marshall Jaffe  This is a topic that every DIY investor should consider carefully  There is a lot at stake 

Watch out for 

Tweet targets    a 14  loser  came into the sights a noted short seller  There is an interesting dynamic here  The reputation of the source would have an immediate effect  Any  in the know  pals would be on board  There is plenty of money to be made  whether you have a short position before the announcement  or like the company and buy into the selling 
Final Thoughts
Despite the uncertain environment  volatility has been a matter for individual stocks  The overall market forces seem to have found a balance  I do not view volatility as a concern  and suggest caution to those using this as a hedge 
The improving economic data have not  yet   shown up in the earnings reports  Perhaps it is because the improvement came so late in the quarter  I see more sources noting that earnings seem to be trailing the improving economic news 
There is plenty of temptation to link your investments to the electoral change  My base position is that you should not regard it as important  instead figuring out how to profit from the new policies  Be politically agnostic 
What I am watching 
A psychological element worth following is the improvement in business and consumer sentiment  This was  in reports from the   Just as the pre election negative environment weighed on the economy  confidence could also become a self fulfilling prophecy

102191,323706,AVGO,Week In Review  Wall St  Higher  Oil  USD Up  ECB Extends QE,opinion,"by Eli Wright
Last week  US Indices continued their push higher mostly ignoring potential risk events  European markets treated last Sunday s Italian referendum vote as a minor speed bump  while oil and the USD both continued their upward trajectory over the course of the week  And last Thursday  the ECB kept rates steady but extended their current QE monetary policy of bond buying through the end of 2017  at least 
Here s how it all played out 
Wall Street to all time highs
Wall Street had a terrific week with all the majors breaking records  This was the fourth time over five weeks that the major indices closed up on the week  As well  markets saw their sixth consecutive day of gains on Friday 
The Dow added more than 500 points to close at a new all time high of 19 756 85 within striking distance of the much heralded 20 000 benchmark  which could very well be reached before the end of the year  In particular  Transports gained more than 300 points  The NASDAQ had a record close at at 5 444 50  while the S P 500 hit a new high of 2 259 to finish the week 
Following a better than expected earnings report  Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  was the largest daily gainer among SPX companies for the week  Several travel related companies  including United Continental  NYSE UAL   American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  and TripAdvisor  NASDAQ TRIP  also fared well  Of particular note  fully one third of the biggest gainers  see chart below  were healthcare stocks including Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  and Pfizer  NYSE PFE   indicating  perhaps  that the healthcare sector and Big Pharma in particular may have shrugged off President elect Trump s recent critical comments regarding drug pricing 


Italians vote no to constitutional reform
Italian voters emphatically said no to constitutional reform and Prime Minister Renzi tendered his resignation as promised  though whether he actually ends up completely out of Italian politics is yet to be seen  Markets were rightfully nervous about the possibility of as many as eight Italian banks failing should the referendum not pass  followed by a possible contagion effect on EU and global banks 
As it turned out  the correctly predicted victory for the no vote had already been factored in by markets  and indices in the UK  Europe and the US simply pushed higher  Italian banks gained 15  on the week  rising to six month highs  although they ended on Friday with a down note  losing 2 2  on the day 

Italian banks could continue higher next week  however  toward the next critical level at 9 563 36  Still  since too many of the country s banks remain in precarious financial positions carrying loads of bad debt and in desperate need of additional capital infusions it s just as likely they could turn back toward major resistance between 8 500 8 800  before possibly falling further  to 8 000 
EURO STOXX 600 Bank Futures rose a modest 3 5 percent  while in the United States  the S P Bank ETF  NYSE KBE  finished 4 6  higher  As in Italy  US and European bank stocks took a small dip on Friday and could retrace back towards stronger resistance levels 
The dollar finished strong
The dollar struggled for much of the week  with the Dollar Index briefly dropping below 100 at one point  However  it found its footing on Friday  rising to 101 60 
The Japanese yen fell 1 5  to a ten month low  Sterling also had a down week  falling 1 25  versus the dollar  to  1 259 
The euro was hit hard as well  as economists who had been looking forward to asset purchases extending for no more than six months watched the ECB prolonged its stimulus through the end of next year  with only a small drop in bond buying from March December  The euro  which had been up near  1 075 earlier in the week  closed down at  1 055  That level could yield to bearish pressure and  1 045 could easily be broken  However  if it holds  the euro could retrace back to  1 075 

Precisely where the dollar goes from here is largely in Chair Yellen s hands  It s basically a given that the Fed will raise rates by 25 base points this week  markets will therefore be watching for any clues as to when the next rate hike  or hikes  will occur 
Commodity currencies  including the Canadian dollar and Russian ruble  rose along with oil   up 1  and 3   respectively 
Non OPEC nations agree to cut oil production
Oil dropped in the middle of last week following skepticism on Tuesday and Wednesday regarding the OPEC deal to cut output  However it rebounded at the close  Brent ended Friday at  54 36 and crude finished at  51 49  Yesterday  oil received a big potential boost for this coming week s open as OPEC and non OPEC nations struck their first non production deal since 2001  Russia promised to remove 300 000 barrels per day from the market  while other non OPEC countries  including Oman  Venezuela  Mexico  Bahrain and Azerbaijan agreed to match those cuts  Between OPEC and non OPEC nations  this represents a 2  decrease in oil production for a six month period beginning in January 
The success of the deal now hinges on whether or not countries adhere to the new restrictions  Oil prices have surged by 15  since OPEC first announced their deal on November 30  At this point  oil has near term  60 upside  However  it could also retrace back below  50 if rumors of the deal falling apart gain traction or US shale output increases become reality ",2016-12-11,Investing.com,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/last-week:-wall-street,-oil,-dollar-–-all-up-200169351",200169351

PNC Financial Services shares lagged the S P 500 index through last month s election  but have turned around in a notable way since November 8th  as have other bank stocks  The stock is up more than 14  since the election  outperforming both the Finance sector as well as the broader market  Driving the stock is the recent upturn in long term interest rates and expectations of regulatory overhaul  While these favorable macro developments are helpful to all banks  the analyst likes PNC for its cost saving initiatives and consistent growth in loans and deposits and fee income   You can  
ConocoPhillips shares have surpassed those of major U S  oil and gas integrated companies over the past one year  gaining nearly 4   The analyst stresses that ConocoPhillips is touted to be the largest exploration and production player in the world  based on proved reserves and production  OPEC s recent decision to cut production for the first time since 2008 is likely to assist the global oil prices to stabilize and further improve ConocoPhillips stock price  Multinational oil enterprises  like COP   on the back of greater certainty  will now be able revive spending on drilling activities  Improvement on the cost front is another positive  However  until the uncertainty and volatility in oil prices subside  there is limited upside from current levels   You can

102262,323777,AVGO,Hewlett Packard Enterprise  HPE  Q4 Earnings  What s Up ,opinion,Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company   NYSE HPE   is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results on Nov 22  Last quarter  the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 8 89  It should be noted that with the end of the fourth quarter on Oct 31  the company completed one year of operation following the split from its parent Hewlett Packard Company Prior to the split  Hewlett Packard Company was a leading global provider of computing products  technologies  software and services to individual consumers  SMBs and large enterprises  including those operating in the public and educational sectors  Products like PCs and access devices  imaging and printing related products and services  enterprise IT infrastructure  and multi vendor customer services including support  maintenance  consulting  integration and outsourcing comprised its offerings Post the split  Hewlett Packard Company s PC and printer business operates under the name HP Inc    NYSE HPQ    while Hewlett Packard Enterprise offers commercial tech products Factors to ConsiderWe believe that the parent company s  Hewlett Packard Company  initiative to split the business has started benefiting Hewlett Packard Enterprise  In our opinion  a split allows a customized approach to two different businesses  which might not have been possible if they operate as a single entity Hewlett Packard Enterprise has done reasonably well in enterprise class server  storage market  networking and related services  and it intends to maintain its focus on these fast growing and higher margin businesses Since the split Hewlett Packard Enterprise s Chief Operating Officer  CEO   Meg Whitman  has been looking to reduce the company s large portfolio of non core businesses that are now struggling to maintain their growth trajectory In keeping with this effort  the company  in September this year  announced that it will spin off the software business and merge the same with British software firm  Micro Focus International Plc  in a cash stock deal worth  8 8 billion The transaction  which is subject to certain regulatory approvals  is anticipated to be tax free for the company  Per the agreement  the company will receive  2 5 billion in cash and a 50 1  stake in the merged entity  which is currently estimated to be worth  6 3 billion Also  Hewlett Packard Enterprise completed the sale of 84  of its 60 5  equity stake in Mphasis Limited  an IT service provider in Bangalore  India  to The Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group in September  The transaction has fetched the company around  700 million Furthermore  this May  it announced the spin off of its struggling IT services segment   Enterprise Services   and entered into an agreement to merge the same with Computer Sciences Corp  NYSE CSC  The primary motive behind such a massive restructuring drive is to reassure investors of the company s sustained focus on improving profitability and returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases We believe that Hewlett Packard Enterprise s ongoing business overhaul will yield long term benefits by supporting innovation and leading to cost savings We also believe that successful deployment of the company s products will boost its top line  going forward However  macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near term concerns  Competition from International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  and Oracle  NYSE ORCL  add to its woes Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Hewlett Packard Enterprise is 0 00  since the Most Accurate estimate of 61

5 Top ROE Picks as Q3 Earnings Come In

	The earnings season is gradually moving toward the business end with over 800 companies reporting this week  Based on the hitherto observed pattern  Q3 might well end up in the positive territory after five consecutive quarters of earnings decline for the benchmark index  Encouraging labor market data and rising oil prices also raise hopes of a rate hike this year  giving a much needed boost to the equity market that has been witnessing intense volatility of late  However  uncertainties related to the approaching presidential elections eclipse the prospects to some extent 

	Amid such an equivocal scenario  investors are often on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that would enable them to rake in more profits 
	However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Significance of ROE
	ROE   Net Income Shareholders  Equity
	ROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns 
	Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher the better  It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening Parameters
	In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we take a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock 

Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  Of course  the higher the ROA  the better it is 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
	Here are 5 of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening LyondellBasell Industries N V   NYSE        Based in Rotterdam  the Netherlands  LyondellBasell is a leading chemical and refining firm with operations across 18 countries  The company s products are used across a bevy of industries including electronics  automotive parts  packaging  construction materials and biofuels  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a decent long term earnings growth expectation of 8  and a modest trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 4 83  Citrix Systems  Inc   NASDAQ        Headquartered in Fort Lauderdale  Citrix is a leading provider of virtualization  networking and cloud computing solutions to more than 230 000 organizations worldwide  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a solid trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 25 12  and long term earnings growth projection of 9 6  Boston Scientific Corporation  NYSE        Headquartered in Natick  MA  and founded in 1979  Boston Scientific manufactures medical devices and products used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 6 3  and long term earnings growth expectation of 11 2  Broadcom Limited  NASDAQ        Based in Singapore  Broadcom Limited is a premier designer  developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog semiconductor devices and digital  mixed signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems  The company has a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 7  and long term earnings growth expectation of 14 3   Broadcom sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can

3 Stocks to Buy on a Market Pullback

Trading equities this summer could have put even a wide eyed novice to sleep  For two months the market went absolutely nowhere and volatility was stuck close to all time lows  But now  summer vacation is over and the volatility index has woken up after markets were spooked about a possible September Fed rate hike 

Since the Brexit spike  volatility has been stuck around 12  but the last two days have seen an aggressive spike  pushing the VIX up to 20 early this morning  Traders are starting to get nervous that the Fed might hike rates twice to finish out the year  Recent Fed speak is the cause for the move  as comments on Friday led to a 2  plus selloff 

This might seem silly to most investors who think long term  But in reality  the market was due for a pullback and the complacency that we saw over the summer is now making greedy longs a little nervous 

So let s say the market stays weak into the Fed and continues lower  Where and what do you buy  Looking at the S P 500 there are a couple levels that are interesting  The 200 day moving average is sitting at 2058  a spot that everyone will be watching  The 200 day was cracked on the Brexit panic  but was quickly an area of support after the bounce 

However  I believe this area could be front run with a couple Fibonacci levels  The halfway back  50   level drawn from Brexit lows to recent highs is at 2085 and could find support  If not there I will be looking at 2062  the 61 8  level for support  That level would font run the 200 day be a couple handles and force the 200 day buyers to chase when they realized they missed the entry 

The levels are important to know  but it s more important to know what to trade when these levels are hit  Below I list four top ranked stocks that should be scooped up when the sellers are panicking  These stocks have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a recent track record of earnings beats 

Broadcom     is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that is a designer  developer and supplier of analog and digital semiconductor connectivity solutions  The company was founded in 2005  employs over 8 000 people and is headquartered in Singapore 

Broadcom is valued at  64 billion and has a forward PE of 17  The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of A in Momentum and pays out a dividend of 1 24  

Early this month the company beat on the top line and had an 11 cent EPS beat  or almost 8   Despite multiple price upgrades from a variety of analysts the stock sold off  If the stock continues to fall to the 200 day just under  150  the stock must be bought  However  I m eyeing a trendline and Fib level at  157 for a starter position 

Ambarella     is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that develops video compression and image processing semiconductors  The company was founded in 2004  has only 640 employees and is based in Santa Clara  California 

Ambarella has a market cap of  2 billion and a forward PE of 41  The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of A in Momentum  but a D in Value  The high PE is the reason for the low value score and the company will need to grow into the PE to support the stock  Recent earnings have investors hopeful that this growth can be achieved 

Last quarter  Ambarella surprised on EPS by 56   while beating on revenue by  1 2 million  The stock sold off much like AVGO and will create an opportunity if it continues lower 

The  61 area is the 50 day moving average  but if markets head lower it will likely break and head down quickly  While to 200 day is just under  50  I will look to start buying around the  54 area  which is a halfway back Fibonacci level 

Netease     is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that is an Internet technology company engaged in the development of applications  services and other technologies for the Internet in China  The company was founded in 1997  employs almost 13 000 people and is headquartered in Beijing  China 

Netease is valued at  28 Billion and has a forward PE of 18  The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of B in both Growth and Momentum and has an expected EPS growth rate of 26  

Last month the company beat on the top line  had a 33  EPS beat and raised its dividend 6 8   Online game revenue growth continues to amaze with revenues coming in at 6 4 billion Yuan  CNY   69  higher than the CNY3 78 Billion seen last year  Advertising revenue year over year was up 24   from CNY428 Million to CNY531 Million  The email  ecommerce and other segments also saw impressive growth  seeing revenue jump from CNY483 Million to CNY1 98 Billion 

The numbers continue to impress and a market pullback could knock the volatile stock back down under the  200 level  A pullback to the  170 level would allow a good entry above the 200 day at  168 

In Summary

When the markets start to panic your number one job is to stay calm and focus  There will be opportunity when there is blood and you need to be ready  Take time to make a watch list and target companies that are performing both fundamentally and technically  When the market bounces you will be rewarded

102363,323878,AVGO,Nordstrom  Virgin America  Broadcom  Applied Materials And Ultrapar PA Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   September 13  2016    highlights Nordstrom  NYSE JWN     as the Bull of the Day and   Virgin America      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on   Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO         Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT     and Ultrapar PA    

Here is a synopsis of all the five stocks  

  

It has been a challenging environment for most mall based retailers thanks to the rising trend for on line shopping and increasing competition from off price fashion chains  Most retail stocks were hammered earlier this year but some of them rebounded strongly after their second quarter results were not as bad as feared 

Headquartered in Seattle  Nordstrom    is an upscale fashion retailer offering clothing  shoes and accessories for men  women and children  Founded in 1901  they now operate 333 stores in 39 states and Canada  including 120 full line stores  205 Nordstrom Rack locations  five Trunk Club clubhouses  two Jeffrey boutiques and one clearance store 
	Additionally  their merchandise is available through Nordstrom com  and HauteLook 
	During FY 2015  71  of revenue came from their full price operations and 29  from off price  They have been gaining market share in their business  with 50  sales growth over last five years Strong Results and Raised Guidance
	Nordstrom delivered a big earnings beat even though their sales were slightly shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Earnings of  0 67 per share were substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 55  but down 38 5  year over year  Outperformance was driven by efficient inventory and expense management  along with increased sales at the company s grand anniversary sale event  Per management their anniversary sale event this year was one of its biggest in a long time 
	While sales at their full price stores fell  sales at their discount stores  Nordstrom Rack and Hautelook surged  The company also raised its full year earnings guidance to  2 60  2 75 a share Rising Estimates
	Analysts have raised their estimates after strong results  Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next year have surged to  2 71 and  3 00 per share  from  2 54 and  2 88 earlier 



  



Low fuel prices had lifted airlines  stocks last year but the outlook has turned negative this year thanks to overcapacity  terrorist attacks  currency headwinds and plunging fares  Most airlines have reported disappointing earnings for the recent quarter  Virgin America has seen a sharp plunge in analyst estimates after lackluster results  which sent the stock to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  About the Company
	Launched in 2007   Virgin America      is a California based airline  Richard Branson s Virgin Group is a minority share investor in Virgin America but the airline is an entirely separate company from the British airline Virgin Atlantic founded by Branson 
	The airline is known for providing a quality flying experience  with mood lit cabins  custom designed leather seats and advanced entertainment system  They have won a number of awards for excellence Lackluster Second Quarter Results

Confusion from the Crow s Nest

I think globally to start each week  Do You  Follow me on Twitter  johnblank100
	Secure the main decks on your trading ship to start this global week ahead  We are likely to see machine traded  algorithmic momentum programs issuing sell orders  Fear was the initial driver  Selling is carrying over mechanically from last Friday 

As the global week ahead unfolds  an excellent metaphor for the current state of share markets hails from early sailors  They consistently faced off with sudden turbulence on high seas and unseen menaces 

These early explorers got into what was called the crow s nest to gain a better  more long term perspective of what lay over the horizon  The further ahead the lookout could see  the more time the captain and crew below had to position their precious ship 

In the early 19th century  the crow s nest was simply a barrel or basket lashed to the tallest mast  Wiki says Arctic Explorer William Scoresby invented the barrel crow s nest in 1807 

According to a different popular naval legend  the term goes back much further  It derives from the practice of Viking sailors 

They carried crows or ravens in a cage secured to the top of the mast  In cases of poor visibility  a crow was released  The navigator plotted a course corresponding to the bird s flight path  because the crow invariably headed towards the nearest land 

After climbing into the crow s nest  strategists looked ahead for this stock market s menaces  Unfortunately  I share with traders a confused insight  When share markets get sleepy and trade sideways    like they did in July and August    well placed advisors in the equity strategist crow s nest take up one of 2 broad perspectives 
	The safe idea is trading rooms were on a collective summer vacation  Volume was down seasonally  Dormant bulls will rise again into the fall 
	The more menacing idea   this was an eerie calm before more intense bearish events arrive on the calendar 
	I agree  that s not much help  Only one good insight takes root  When market confusion reigns from the view of the crow s nest  the safest thing below is to secure the decks 
	On Monday  three U S  Fed speakers tee off in various parts of the country  That many Fed voices speaking at one time has stoked up building fears    the FOMC consensus after the coming Sept  20   21 meeting will be hawkish 
	The Fed may soon hit richly valued major USA stock indices with a 25 basis point rate hike  Then  this curiously played Presidential election picks up in its intensity  If you have stock profits on the table  why not get them off the table before that Conclusion  1  Sell stocks for profit now 
	LPL Financial Equity Strategist Ryan Detrick tweeted us these grim facts  The last 2 times the S P 500 index was down  2  on a Friday  the following Monday was down  3 9   August 21  2015  and  1 8   June 24  2016  Conclusion  2  Buy the dip mid week 
	As for the end of this global week ahead  the Bank of England monetary policy committee meets on Thursday  Mario Draghi speaks in Italy  There is going to be a public discussion of Brexit at the EU parliament  led by its leaders 
	That may seem a distant shore when stocks sell off hard to start a week 

Yet  keep your eyes on those external events too Top Zacks  1 Rank stocks to look into  
	 1  Broadcom    is a  64 billion market cap diverse semiconductor company  The stock gets a Zacks  1 Rank and a Zacks VGM score of B  Shares price in richly at  160 a share  after a recent sell off  The PEG ratio is 1 10 
	 2  Applied Materials    is another semiconductor wafer fabrication stock to look into  This  31 billion market cap stock has is a Zacks  1 Rank stock with a Zacks VGM score of B  Shares price more cheaply at  28 each  The PEG ratio is 1 05 
	 3  Look into Ultrapar PA ADRs    for oil production and pipeline exposure  and petrochemical and chemical production  This  12 billion market cap stock has a Zacks  1 Rank and a Zacks VGM score of B 
	Ultrapar is a major Brazilian industrial group  It is one of the largest distributors of liquefied petroleum gas in Brazil and a leading producer of petrochemicals and chemicals

Driehaus Strategy
After studying Driehaus  strategy thoroughly  AAII concluded that it focuses on companies with impressive earnings growth rates and the potential to maintain the positive trend  The strategy also gives emphasis to companies that have a solid track of beating expectations  Moreover  it works better for longer time periods 
Driehaus had said in an interview   That means buying stocks that have already had good moves and have high relative strength   that is  stocks in demand by other investors  I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around  
How to Apply the Strategy
Based on Driehaus  approach  we have created a screen for picking solid momentum stocks  To it  we have added positive relative strength as an important criterion  We have backed it up with the percentage 50 day moving average   which is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price by the 50 day moving average of month end price   Positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend

102367,323882,AVGO,5 Top ROE Stocks To Buy Amid Market Volatility,opinion,Reminiscent of its earlier performances in the month of September  the U S  equity market is still grappling with high volatility  The uncertainty can be partially attributed to the still elusive rate hike decision of Fed Chair Janet Yellen  Speculations are rife that a market correction is imminent in the near future  triggering further chaos Amid such adversities  investors are often on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that would enable them to rake in more profits However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  An Effective Financial MetricROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher the better  It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening Parameters for Solid ROE StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we take a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy    Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  Of course  the higher the ROA  the better it is 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength    Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are 5 of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening Macy s  Inc    NYSE M    Based in Cincinnati  OH  Macy s is one of the leading department store retailers in the U S

5 Top ROE Stocks to Buy Amid Market Volatility

	Reminiscent of its earlier performances in the month of September  the U S  equity market is still grappling with high volatility  The uncertainty can be partially attributed to the still elusive rate hike decision of Fed Chair Janet Yellen  Speculations are rife that a market correction is imminent in the near future  triggering further chaos 

	Amid such adversities  investors are often on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that would enable them to rake in more profits 
	However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  An Effective Financial Metric
	ROE   Net Income Shareholders  Equity
	ROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns 
	Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher the better  It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening Parameters for Solid ROE Stocks
	In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we take a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock 

Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  Of course  the higher the ROA  the better it is 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see     
	Here are 5 of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening Macy s  Inc       Based in Cincinnati  OH  Macy s is one of the leading department store retailers in the U S   operating approximately 870 outlets under the names of Macy s  Bloomingdale s  Bloomingdale s Outlet  Macy s Backstage and Bluemercury  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a decent long term earnings growth expectation of 8 5  and a healthy trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 16 3  Discovery Communications  Inc       Headquartered in Silver Spring  MD  this Zacks Rank  1 stock operates as a global media firm with 3 billion subscribers in more than 220 countries  Discovery Communications offers high quality content through global brands like Discovery Channel  TLC  Investigation Discovery  Animal Planet and Discovery Science  The stock has a strong trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 16 3  Zoetis Inc       Founded in 1952 and headquartered in Florham Park  NJ  Zoetis manufactures and markets veterinary vaccines  medicines  diagnostic products and related services for livestock and companion animals across the globe  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a solid long term earnings growth expectation of 12 6  and a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 15 9  Broadcom Limited      Based in Singapore  Broadcom Limited is a premier designer  developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog semiconductor devices and digital  mixed signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 7  and long term earnings growth expectation of 15  The Priceline Group Inc       Norwalk  CT based Priceline is one of the largest online travel companies in the world  The company s travel related offerings cover hotel rooms  airline tickets  rental cars  vacation packages  cruises   things to do  at customer destinations and travel insurance  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a solid long term earnings growth expectation of 18 3  and a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 6 6

102399,323914,AVGO,Confusion From The Crow s Nest  Global Week Ahead,opinion,"I think globally to start each week  Do You  Follow me on Twitter  johnblank100Secure the main decks on your trading ship to start this global week ahead  We are likely to see machine traded  algorithmic momentum programs issuing sell orders  Fear was the initial driver  Selling is carrying over mechanically from last Friday  
As the global week ahead unfolds  an excellent metaphor for the current state of share markets hails from early sailors  They consistently faced off with sudden turbulence on high seas and unseen menaces  
These early explorers got into what was called the crow s nest to gain a better  more long term perspective of what lay over the horizon  The further ahead the lookout could see  the more time the captain and crew below had to position their precious ship  
In the early 19th century  the crow s nest was simply a barrel or basket lashed to the tallest mast  Wiki says Arctic Explorer William Scoresby invented the barrel crow s nest in 1807  
According to a different popular naval legend  the term goes back much further  It derives from the practice of Viking sailors  
They carried crows or ravens in a cage secured to the top of the mast  In cases of poor visibility  a crow was released  The navigator plotted a course corresponding to the bird s flight path  because the crow invariably headed towards the nearest land  
After climbing into the crow s nest  strategists looked ahead for this stock market s menaces  Unfortunately  I share with traders a confused insight  When share markets get sleepy and trade sideways    like they did in July and August    well placed advisors in the equity strategist crow s nest take up one of 2 broad perspectives The safe idea is trading rooms were on a collective summer vacation  Volume was down seasonally  Dormant bulls will rise again into the fall The more menacing idea   this was an eerie calm before more intense bearish events arrive on the calendar I agree  that s not much help  Only one good insight takes root  When market confusion reigns from the view of the crow s nest  the safest thing below is to secure the decks On Monday  three U S  Fed speakers tee off in various parts of the country  That many Fed voices speaking at one time has stoked up building fears    the FOMC consensus after the coming Sept  20   21 meeting will be hawkish The Fed may soon hit richly valued major USA stock indices with a 25 basis point rate hike  Then  this curiously played Presidential election picks up in its intensity  If you have stock profits on the table  why not get them off the table before that Conclusion  1  Sell stocks for profit now LPL Financial Equity Strategist Ryan Detrick tweeted us these grim facts  The last 2 times the S P 500 index was down  2  on a Friday  the following Monday was down  3 9   August 21  2015  and  1 8   June 24  2016    Conclusion  2  Buy the dip mid week As for the end of this global week ahead  the Bank of England monetary policy committee meets on Thursday  Mario Draghi speaks in Italy  There is going to be a public discussion of Brexit at the EU parliament  led by its leaders   That may seem a distant shore when

102400,323915,AVGO,3 Stocks To Buy On A Market Pullback,opinion,"Trading equities this summer could have put even a wide eyed novice to sleep  For two months the market went absolutely nowhere and volatility was stuck close to all time lows  But now  summer vacation is over and the volatility index has woken up after markets were spooked about a possible September Fed rate hike 
Since the Brexit spike  volatility has been stuck around 12  but the last two days have seen an aggressive spike  pushing the VIX up to 20 early this morning  Traders are starting to get nervous that the Fed might hike rates twice to finish out the year  Recent Fed speak is the cause for the move  as comments on Friday led to a 2  plus selloff 

This might seem silly to most investors who think long term  But in reality  the market was due for a pullback and the complacency that we saw over the summer is now making greedy longs a little nervous 
So let s say the market stays weak into the Fed and continues lower  Where and what do you buy  Looking at the S P 500 there are a couple levels that are interesting  The 200 day moving average is sitting at 2058  a spot that everyone will be watching  The 200 day was cracked on the Brexit panic  but was quickly an area of support after the bounce 
However  I believe this area could be front run with a couple Fibonacci levels  The halfway back  50   level drawn from Brexit lows to recent highs is at 2085 and could find support  If not there I will be looking at 2062  the 61 8  level for support  That level would font run the 200 day be a couple handles and force the 200 day buyers to chase when they realized they missed the entry 
The levels are important to know  but it s more important to know what to trade when these levels are hit  Below I list four top ranked stocks that should be scooped up when the sellers are panicking  These stocks have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a recent track record of earnings beats 
Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   AVGO  is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that is a designer  developer and supplier of analog and digital semiconductor connectivity solutions  The company was founded in 2005  employs over 8 000 people and is headquartered in Singapore 
Broadcom is valued at  64 billion and has a forward PE of 17  The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of A in Momentum and pays out a dividend of 1 24  
Early this month the company beat on the top line and had an 11 cent EPS beat  or almost 8   Despite multiple price upgrades from a variety of analysts the stock sold off  If the stock continues to fall to the 200 day just under  150  the stock must be bought  However  I m eyeing a trendline and Fib level at  157 for a starter position 

 
Ambarella  AMBA  is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that develops video compression and image processing semiconductors  The company was founded in 2004  has only 640 employees and is based in Santa Clara  California 
Ambarella has a market cap of  2 billion and a forward PE of 41  The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of A in Momentum  but a D in Value  The high PE is the reason for the low value score and the company will need to grow into the PE to support the stock  Recent earnings have investors hopeful that this growth can be achieved 
Last quarter  Ambarella surprised on EPS by 56   while beating on revenue by  1 2 million  The stock sold off much like AVGO and will create an opportunity if it continues lower 
The  61 area is the 50 day moving average  but if markets head lower it will likely break and head down quickly  While to 200 day is just under  50  I will look to start buying around the  54 area  which is a halfway back Fibonacci level 
Netease  NTES  is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that is an Internet technology company engaged in the development of applications  services and other technologies for the Internet in China  The company was founded in 1997  employs almost 13 000 people and is headquartered in Beijing  China 
Netease is valued at  28 Billion and has a forward PE of 18  The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of B in both Growth and Momentum and has an expected EPS growth rate of 26  
Last month the company beat on the top line  had a 33  EPS beat and raised its dividend 6 8   Online game revenue growth continues to amaze with revenues coming in at 6 4 billion Yuan  CNY   69  higher than the CNY3 78 Billion seen last year  Advertising revenue year over year was up 24   from CNY428 Million to CNY531 Million  The email  ecommerce and other segments also saw impressive growth  seeing revenue jump from CNY483 Million to CNY1 98 Billion 
The numbers continue to impress and a market pullback could knock the volatile stock back down under the  200 level  A pullback to the  170 level would allow a good entry above the 200 day at  168 

 
In Summary
When the markets start to panic your number one job is to stay calm and focus  There will be opportunity when there is blood and you need to be ready  Take time to make a watch list and target companies that are performing both fundamentally and technically  When the market bounces you will be rewarded

Despite better than expected earnings in each quarter of the past 2 fiscal years  shares have been cut by nearly 70 
Ambarella s success is largely contingent on GoPro which has delivered negative revenue growth in the past 2 quarters
This earnings season saw many sectors suffer  particularly technology and semiconductors  These trends should continue the next few days when names like Ambarella and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  report earnings  Ambarella has delivered strong earnings since its IPO in 2014 but that hasn t been enough to please investors  In its limited time on the market  the stock has lost more than 50  of its value on decelerating growth and weak future guidance  Unfortunately  Ambarella s success is contingent on GoPro  NASDAQ GPRO   which has posted negative revenue growth in each of the past 2 quarters

The report is fostering volatility as the markets grapple with whether the sharp slowdown in job growth was an anomaly  and if the report will keep the Fed on hold  However  the hourly earnings component of the release  which showed a 2 5  rise over the past 12 months  continued to suggest wage growth is picking up 
The Institute for Supply Management  ISM  non Manufacturing Index    fell to 52 9 in May from 55 7 in April  and compared to forecasts of a dip to 55 3  but remained in expansion territory  above 50   New orders and business activity both declined solidly  though staying above 50  Employment fell back into contraction and growth in prices accelerated 
The final Markit U S  Services PMI Index was revised to 51 3 in May from the preliminary level of 51 2  versus expectations of an upwardly revised 51 4  The index was down from the 52 8 reading registered in April  The release is independent and differs from ISM s report  as it has less historic value and Markit weights its index components differently

European stocks mostly lower  Asia nudges higher European equities mostly reversed to the downside as the markets reacted to the large miss in the May job growth and a disappointing services sector report in the U S   which appeared to overshadow an upbeat read on eurozone business activity for May  Financials were the largest drag on the markets as the U S  data dialed back heightened summer Fed rate hike expectations  The final Markit Eurozone Composite PMI Index a gauge of output from the manufacturing and services sectors was revised higher to 53 1 from the preliminary level of 52 9  where it was expected to remain  A reading above 50 denotes expansion and the index was up slightly from the 53 0 level posted in April

Stocks in Asia finished mostly higher on the heels of the gains in the U S  yesterday  though conviction was likely hampered by today s May U S  nonfarm payroll report  Japanese stocks shrugged off the continued rally in the yen  which had weighed on the markets the past two sessions  as well as a softer than expected read on the nation s wages for April  Equities trading in mainland China and Hong Kong gained ground  despite a report from Caixin Markit that showed growth in the nation s key services sector output decelerated in May  mirroring the country s official Services PMI Index s slip reported earlier this week Finally  stocks trading in South Korea and India finished flat 
Stocks mixed in volatile shortened week
U S  stocks finished mixed in the holiday shortened week amid heightened volatility as the markets grappled with a plethora of global events  Domestic stocks were trudging along showing some resiliency in the face of flared up Brexit concerns  mixed reads on Chinese business activity  and fiscal concerns that jumped in Japan after the nation delayed a sales tax hike again  The global markets appeared to come to grips with the heightened possibility of a summer Fed rate hike  bolstered by upbeat reports on U S  manufacturing activity and personal spending 
However  Friday s massive job growth miss and much softer than expected services sector report stymied rate hike expectations  The U S  dollar fell and Treasuries rallied as traders unwound some recent Fed fueled positioning  Crude oil prices slipped slightly as the fall in the U S  dollar failed to lift prices  while a Thursday OPEC meeting concluded with no coordinated action  Europe moved lower on the week amid the Brexit uncertainty and as the European Central Bank maintained its monetary policy stance  Japanese stocks fell as the yen rallied on the aforementioned sales tax hike delay  China was a standout winner this week  courtesy of optimism the nation s A shares will get inclusion into MSCI Inc s global benchmark indexes

102461,323976,AVGO,May Jobs Report Brings Fed Into Focus,opinion,"In almost any endeavor  it is critically important to believe what someone is telling you is true  In the business world  and especially with investing  being able to rely on management to do what it says  or at least try its darnedest to get their goals accomplished  might be more significant than anything else one considers  Conversely  if a person gets the reputation for  embellishing the truth   it can be the kiss of death as far as reputation is concerned  Yesterday s weak May jobs report  one where only 38 thousand jobs were created  as opposed to the 160K estimate   may very well be a critical moment for the current Federal Reserve Board  Why  Over the last few months  multiple board members have gone on record at noting the strength of the U S  economy in an effort to convince the investment community interest rate hikes were a distinct possibility  if not in June than in July  Given the dramatic miss in job creation  and that the Fed has often stated it will be data dependent in making policy decisions  a reasonable person might question the data the Fed is looking at  It is also on the table to ask how these board members are interpreting the information they are seeing 
Even further  and more critical  is taking the next step and questioning whether the current policy is appropriate given the dramatic under performance of the job creating ability of the economy  Macroeconomic analysis is complex and not easy  which is why many investors  like myself  spend a far greater amount of time concentrating on the microeconomics of specific businesses and their valuation  It might be a bit of a stretch to imply the Federal Reserve Board s reputation for integrity is now lost  but as the above quote simply states  some things are difficult or almost impossible to retrieve 
In Europe  Mario Draghi determined the ECB will leave interest rates alone  while raising no doubt it will do everything in its power  including more quantitative easing  to fight deflation  The implications of the poor jobs report means the dollar will probably stay weak versus emerging market currencies and commodities  like oil  Markets responded to the punk number by bidding up the commodity based country indexes of Canada  the euro  and the South American countries  sans the joy of Venezuela  Looking ahead  the futures market priced the expectation of a June interest rate hike at literally zero  with July minimal as well  In this regard  you have to say markets definitely are efficient 
With respect to individual companies and earnings reports  Ambarella Inc  NASDAQ AMBA  and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  enjoyed better than expected numbers and gave some lift to the semiconductor area  as well as maybe helping expectations for the back half of the year  Michael Kors Holdings Limited  NYSE KORS  showed fashion is still in swing with a solid beat but warned of softness in the next six months in order to reduce the prevalence of discounting  Vera Bradley Inc  NASDAQ VRA  also exceeded their estimates  so the luxury sector is still worth keeping your eye on  In the oil patch  the joy which is OPEC continues to show their dysfunction as the independence of Iran to pump at full throttle undermines the ability of the organization to affect prices  What a shame  the fellows from OPEC cannot get it together  Here in the U S   rig counts actually went up a bit  but from the rock bottom level of around 350  Oil still trades at around the  50 a barrel level  and it bears watching to see if demand improves

102502,324017,AVGO,5 Stocks With Solid Dividend Growth To Buy Now,opinion,"Dividend investing has been in vogue since the start of the year given the instability in the market and global growth concerns  In fact  investors are chasing dividend growth when fears of dividend cuts are high amid macro uncertainties 
Importance of Dividend Growth 
A stock with a history of increasing dividends year over year is considered healthy and latent with higher capital appreciation opportunity irrespective of the stock market direction  Stocks with solid dividend growth generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and offers downside protection with its consistent increase in payouts 
Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they are proven outperformers over the long term 
Hence  for finding stocks with a solid dividend growth history  we have focused on 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth of more than zero  The combination of this metric with other exciting parameters could result in a winning portfolio 
Other Parameters
Most Recent Payout Ratio less than M Industry  This is the measure of dividend payments as a percentage of earnings  A relatively low payout ratio indicates the company s ability to increase dividend in the future even in tough times  
Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate Over 10   This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  An improving earnings should help the companies keep paying dividends 
Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for a better cash flow generated by the company 
52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Median   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year 
Zacks Rank less than 3  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and 2  Buy  generally outperform than their peers in any type of market environment 
Growth Style Score of B or better  This further evaluates the company s growth prospects through the analysis of its income statement  balance sheet and cash flow statement  Stocks with a Growth Score of  A  or  B  are deemed the strongest when combined with Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Market Capitalization greater than  2 billion  We have eliminated small caps stocks to ensure better flexibility and tradability 
Here are five of the nine stocks that fit the bill 
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd     NYSE RCL   
Lear Corp     NYSE LEA

102532,324047,AVGO,Forget AMD  Buy These 3 Semiconductor Stocks,opinion,"Earlier this week Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  announced that it had lowered its revenue and gross margin estimates for the second quarter  which caused a stock slide of 15 38  for day on Tuesday  The company said that it estimates revenues to have an 8  decrease for the quarter  which is even worse than the original estimated decrease of 3   plus or minus 3   In regards to gross margin  the company estimates a 28  margin  also lower than original estimates that had gross margin estimated at 32  for the quarter 
AMD is in the midst of shifting its focus towards gaming and low power servers  but progress has not advanced as quickly as expected  causing the drops in revenue and margins 
With a high Zacks Industry rank of 88 265  top 33    AMD finds itself in an industry that is very solid as a whole  Despite AMD s struggles  there are several other stocks that are in much better positions at present  These stocks make for intriguing investment opportunities  Although AMD is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   the following 3 semiconductor stocks are much better options for investment  and warrant legitimate consideration as a potential addition into any investor s portfolio 
Ambarella Inc  NASDAQ AMBA 
A developer of video compression and image processing semiconductors  Ambarella Inc  is one of the best stocks in the industry at the moment  In addition to being a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   the company is projected to see significant growth in sales and earnings in the near future 
Ambarella has projected sales growth of 45 84   and with an extremely favorable net margin of 25 83   Increases in sales means increases in profits for the company  and for potential investors  The company is also projected to see major growth in earnings based off of estimates  with a year over year growth estimate of 67 20  for the current year  Ambarella is likely to reach and even surpass its earnings estimates though  especially if the last 4 quarters are any indicator  The company has seen substantial beats on our earnings estimates in each of the last 4 quarters  with the average beat being 35 63  
On another positive note  a recent acquisition will diversify and potentially provide a major boost for Ambarella s revenue stream moving forward  The company announced that it is buying VisLab  an autonomous vehicle technology company  for  30 million  The autonomous vehicle industry is in its early stages of development but has the potential to grow substantially in the future as it matures and advances 
Avago Technologies Limited  NASDAQ AVGO 
Fellow semiconductor developer and supplier Avago Technologies is another solid option for investment in the semiconductor industry  The company holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  at the moment  and has several strong figures that tend to indicate a strong stock with potential for success 
While not as high as Ambarella s  Avago similarly has a solid net margin of 10 90   meaning that if the projected sales growth figure of 60 80  is correct  net income should be able to grow and bring solid amounts of profits 
Avago s earnings estimates also are estimated to grow significantly  with the year over year growth estimate currently standing at 74 15  for the current year  In addition  analysts are upping their estimates for the current year  with 5 analysts doing so for the current year in the last 60 days  Avago has also been consistent in beating estimates for the company s earnings  Evidence of this is the fact that the company has posted positive beats in each of the last 4 quarters by an average of 19 23  
Synaptics Incorporated  NASDAQ SYNA 
Last  but definitely not least  is Synaptics Inc  a leading developer of human interface solutions for a wide variety of mobile computing and communications devices  The company is a leading supplier of TouchPads to the notebook computer market  As a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and as a company who has seen solid earnings beats in its recent past  Synaptics is currently a viable option for investment  Synaptics also has very recently released a new product  previously unseen in the industry  which may help to boost the company s potential moving forward 
In 3 of the last 4 quarters  Synaptics has been able to not only meet  but beat the earnings estimates made for the company by analysts by an average of 14 44   The past two quarters have produced positive surprises and it can be assured Synaptics will be looking to continue its positive earnings surprise streak to a third quarter 
Synaptics has a year over year earnings growth estimate of 32 43  for the current year  and of 30 49  for next year  but that growth may be even larger than current projections if the the company s newly released product is very beneficial  Just as recently as July 9th  the company released its new and innovative Match in Sensor   fingerprint authentication technology  which is the industry s first fully hardware encapsulated fingerprint sensor and matching system  As the first fingerprinting technology with full isolation from host operating software  the Match in Sensor technology gives Synaptics an advantage over its competition  and could serve as a major revenue booster moving forward 
Bottom Line
While AMD may struggle with company restructuring and a change of company focus  the semiconductor industry as a whole remains strong  with several companies other than AMD being more than viable options for investment  Ambarella Inc   Avago Technologies and Synaptics Inc  are three of the better stocks in the industry  and a lack of consideration to these stocks could be a costly mistake as the three semiconductors are poised to  program  serious profits into investment portfolios in the near future ",2015-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/forget-amd,-buy-these-3-semiconductor-stocks-257876",257876
102554,324069,AVGO,Unstoppable Mobile Trend Fuels Endless Growth,opinion,"Consumers are obsessive beings 

For proof  look no further than the way we fixate on visible  tangible advancements in  

Front  and rear facing cameras  HD quality displays  ultra responsive touchscreens  fingerprint sensors  and smooth  shiny metal cases to protect all this precious technology 

Regrettably  investors are obsessive in much the same way  That is  we become fixated on what can be seen 

This narrow minded view leads us into obvious  overcrowded   and sometimes fatal   investments  The now defunct sapphire display maker  GT Advanced Technologies  is the perfect example 

It s unfortunate  because the most lucrative mobile investments often reside in what s invisible to the naked eye 

Case in point  this triple digit growth trend that s just heating up 

Big Data  Big Problems Opportunity

Mobile devices aren t simply cool gadgets anymore  They ve become vital extensions of ourselves 

Case in point  91  of us are within arm s length of our smartphones at any given moment  according to Morgan Stanley data  We re constantly texting  checking email  surfing the internet  tweeting  gaming  streaming video  The list goes on 

Now  aside from whatever social and cultural issues this mobile obsession throws up  there s another huge problem 

Our beloved smartphones use 24 times more data than old school feature phones 

Consequently  our always connected  high bandwidth  data intensive lifestyles are putting an immense strain on the mobile communications network 

And there s no end in sight 

Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  predicts that on a compounded annual growth rate basis  worldwide mobile data traffic will soar by 57  from 2014 to 2019 

The solution  Add more bandwidth   stat 

If not  we ll be unable to handle all of our data demands 

Unfortunately  though  it s not as simple as flipping a switch  Why 

Well  first  we need more radio spectrum to be made available 

Then  the components inside phones need to be developed so that they can communicate on the new frequency bands 

How do we do this 

In its simplest terms  this is accomplished with things like filters and amplifiers   technology that makes up what s known as the radio frequency  RF  front end 

As Christopher Bowick says in his book  RF Circuit Design   This is arguably the most critical part of the whole receiver  

Agreed  It s what enables phones to communicate wirelessly  And the bottom line is that in order to meet our exploding data demands  more radio frequencies need to be supported in each smartphone 

Therein lies the opportunity 

Rising Costs   Rising Opportunity

Not long ago  the typical smartphone only needed to operate on three or four different frequency bands 

Nowadays  That number is quickly approaching three or four dozen bands 

Translation  Today s smartphones require a lot more RF parts 

Sure enough  the total dollar amount of RF content in high end phones keeps rising 

Take the latest iPhone 6  for example  Total RF front end content costs checked in at  15 89 per phone  according to Barclays  analysis  That s up a staggering 324   compared to a typical 3G phone 

For mobile phone makers  these rising costs keep cutting into margins  But for RF component suppliers  the exact opposite is true   the trend represents a tremendous opportunity 

Or as MKM Partners put it  we re living in  a golden age for smartphone suppliers  

Sounds gimmicky  But it s not 

Just look at the two year chart for the market s top RF front end suppliers   Skyworks Solutions Inc  NASDAQ SWKS  and Avago Technologies Limited  NASDAQ AVGO  



With each company s business booming  it s no surprise that the stocks are up roughly 375  and 275   respectively 

Take  Skyworks  for example 

A Growth Explosion

On the back of what CEO David Aldrich described as  an explosion in analog complexity   the company reported a 59  sales increase to  805 million  and an 88  increase in earnings per share to  1 26 in the most recent quarter 

 We ve been successfully executing with higher and higher dollar content with each successive  smartphone generation    says Aldrich 

I ll say 

This isn t an anomaly  either  Skyworks has reported nine straight quarters of earnings growth and double digit sales growth 

But even after the impressive growth and run up in stock prices  we re still early in the boom 

After all  the three key drivers behind it aren t going to let up any time soon  What are those drivers 

Simply  the growing number of mobile users  runaway data usage  and more advanced wireless standards  3G  4G  etc    Factor them all in  and you can see why this trend is so ingrained and set to last 

The Boom Is Here to Stay

The savviest way to gauge the growth is to track global long term evolution  LTE    or 4G   adoption  Why 

Because it s the fastest and most robust wireless communication network  Enabling phones to communicate on it not only requires more RF content  but also more complex  read  more expensive  RF content 

While a just released report from GSMA Intelligence shows that LTE connections blasted 145  higher last year to about 490 million  it only translates to 7  market penetration 

In other words  the RF boom still has another 93  to go  So the go go days for companies like Skyworks and Avago promise to endure for years to come 

Bottom line  Very few investors think about what it takes on the inside of mobile phones to enable them to work properly  But they should  because it s an incredibly lucrative business for the companies behind such technology   which  in turn  means incredibly lucrative investments  And it s not too late to profit from the boom

102556,324071,AVGO,Defensive Sectors Lead Hesitant Market But Bulls Stand Firm,opinion,"Last week  the major indexes fell back below round number thresholds that had taken a lot of effort to eclipse  There has been an ongoing ebb and flow of capital between risk on and risk off  including high sector correlations  which is far from ideal  But at the end of it all  the S P 500 found itself right back on top of long standing support and poised for a bounce  and Monday s action proved yet again that bulls are determined to defend their long standing uptrend line 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
Last Thursday  semiconductor stocks took a bath  taking the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and the overall market down with it  when SanDisk  NASDAQ SNDK  warned that Q1 revenues could be 10  lower than forecast  The S P 500 lost the 2 100 level  the Dow Jones Industrials lost the 18 000 level  and the NASDAQ lost 5 000  But bulls stood firm at their line in the sand on Friday  leading to Monday s powerful rally 
Many are calling this the most hated and manipulated market in history  But hate has helped prevent the irrational exuberance and subsequent bursting bubble of previous markets  including 1987  2000  and 2007  in which investors were not only fully invested but also heavily margined  Yes  equities are being bought  but the buying is cautious  hesitant  A good bit of high net worth capital is flowing into real estate  private equity  and hedge funds  which is defensive behavior 
Indeed  as we reach the end of Q1  the top performing sector so far this year has been Healthcare by a wide margin  followed by Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical   and then Telecom  As of Monday s close  the only other sectors that are positive are Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  and Utilities  Overall  this is a defensive group 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed Friday at 15 07  which is just barely above the 15 threshold between investor fear and complacency  Nothing onerous here 
The U S  10 Year Treasury yield closed Friday at 1 95  and the U S  dollar continues to trade strong  despite last week s dip  The latest rounds of quant easing from central banks around the world will continue to push global capital into the U S  and keep the dollar strong  as well as limit increases in longer term interest rates  But Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen doesn t want the dollar to rally too strongly  So it is unlikely that the Fed will hike rates until later in the year  as rising rates would further boost the dollar  The most likely scenario seems to be a token rate increase in September  followed by very slow going from there  Moreover  risk assets such as equities and high yield debt should continue to attract capital 
ConvergEx pointed out recently that the yield on the S P 500 is now the same as the 10 year U S  Treasury note at just below 2  and that  relatively speaking  this yield is historically high for stocks and low for bonds given that the 10 year Treasury usually yields twice the average dividend yield  Of course  today s capital markets are quite different than  say  15 years ago  when the 10 year yielded more than 6  and the S P 500 traded at a trailing P E of about 30x and the NASDAQ at 175x  whereas today they are about 18x and 31x  respectively  So  valuations are not too high  Nevertheless  good stock picking remains paramount 
On that note  as Q1 comes to a close  Sabrient s Baker s Dozen annual portfolio of 13 top stocks for the year continues to   led by top performers like Tesoro  NYSE TSO   U S  Silica  NYSE SLCA   Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   and NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI   Note that NXPI  which is a leader in high performance mixed signals  recently announced the acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor  NYSE FSL   a leader in embedded processors  which will make the combined company even more dominant in security  near field communications  and machine to machine connectivity 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 205 74  Once again  for the sixth time in less than four months  it is seeking reliable support from the lower uptrend line of the long standing bullish rising channel   And indeed  Monday s market action gave us a powerful bounce from support  back above the 50 day simple moving average   Apparently  the latest pullback served as yet another opportunity to refresh bullish conviction 
The 100 day simple moving average and the lower trendline joined forces to provide strong support  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all looking ready to turn back up bullishly  The pullback in early March created a bull flag continuation pattern that indeed was confirmed with an upside breakout  and last week s pullback seems to have also formed a bull flag continuation pattern  Below the 50  and 100 day SMAs and the uptrend line resides the critical 200 day SMA  near 201  followed by round number support at the 200 price level  From a technical standpoint  the SPY chart remains bullish  and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF  ARCA IWM  small cap chart is even stronger 

Latest sector rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  multi factor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  A high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative out performance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares which represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  NYSE IYF   Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrial  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
 Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1  Technology continues in first place with an Outlook score of 87  Technology displays the best return ratios  reasonably good forward long term growth rate and forward P E  and relatively sell side analyst sentiment  net revisions to earnings estimates     although all sectors have been hit with net downgrades to forward estimates  Financial takes second at 84 and displays by far the lowest forward P E  above average forward long term growth rate  and the best sentiment among insiders  buying activity   Healthcare takes third with a score of 80 on the strength of solid sell side analyst sentiment  But then there is a big drop down to fourth place Industrial at 48  which is in mid tier pack along with Utilities  Materials  Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical   and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  
2  At the bottom sits Energy and Telecom  Energy continues to hold the bottom spot with an Outlook score of 8 given the persistent weakness in oil prices and the ongoing downward earnings revisions from Wall Street  although the magnitude of downward revisions has lessened   Energy is among the worst in all factors in the model  and in fact its forward long term growth rate is virtually zero 
3  Looking at the Bull scores  Industrial and Financial display the top score of 60  followed by Technology  Healthcare  and Materials  Utilities scores the lowest at 51  Notably  all scores are above 50  The top bottom spread remains narrow at 9 points  which reflects high sector correlations  i e   broad risk on buying   It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold 
4  Looking at the Bear scores  Energy and Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical  display the highest  i e   best  score of 49  which means that stocks within these sectors have been the preferred safe havens  relatively speaking  on weak market days  Utilities and Industrial share the lowest score of 41  Notably  all scores are below 50  The top bottom spread remains a narrow 8 points  which reflects high sector correlations on particularly weak market days  i e   broad risk off selling   Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5  Technology displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Energy and Telecom share the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical  is the strongest  followed by Energy  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Utilities scores the worst 
6  Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings still look mostly bullish to me  with the top four  and six of the top seven  economically sensitive or all weather  Defensive sectors Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  and Telecom rank near the bottom  However  keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   moved to a neutral bias at Friday s close  and suggests holding Technology  Financial  and Healthcare  in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be neutral from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is between its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Technology  Financial  and Healthcare sectors include First Trust NASDAQ CEA Smartphone Index Fund  NASDAQ FONE   First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank Index Fund  NASDAQ QABA   and First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund  NYSE FBT  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Technology  Financial  and Healthcare sectors include Avago Technologies  NASDAQ AVGO   Skyworks Solutions  NASDAQ SWKS   Western Alliance Bancorp  NYSE WAL   Bank of the Ozarks  NASDAQ OZRK   BioMarin Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ BMRN  and Medivation  NASDAQ MDVN   All are highly ranked in the  
If you prefer to maintain a bullish bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Financial  Technology  and Healthcare  in that order  And if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Healthcare  Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical   and Technology  in that order 
IMPORTANT NOTE  I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

102557,324072,AVGO,Forget Oracle   3 Technology Stocks That Are Much Better Buys,opinion,"Investing in the technology sector while being hugely rewarding can also be tricky given the fast pace of evolution  There is no doubt that it is the only sector touching every other in some form or the other  Within the technology sector  cloud computing is an emerging domain  which has been gaining significant traction over the past few years 
The idea of cloud computing is vastly appealing to companies as it can significantly increase the efficiency of operations while reducing costs  Software has made all the difference and it is now provided as a service over the Internet  so enterprises can increasingly purchase just the amount that they need and also scale without any hassles 
However  not all companies in the domain are performing well at present  Oracle Corp  NYSE ORCL  is one such stock  In the last reported quarter  despite managing to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 56   Oracle could not sustain investor confidence 
While Oracle has been taking initiatives to strengthen its capabilities in the cloud  the ongoing business transition on the one hand and the strengthening of the U S  dollar on the other continue to weigh on the company s financials  Further  revenues from a cloud subscription model are realized over a period of several years  which remains a drag in the near term 
Year to date  shares of this software provider have dipped about 3 02  compared with an increase of 2 43  in the S P 500 index over the same time  Moreover  of late  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock has been witnessing negative estimate revisions 
The company s long term growth estimate of 9 4  is also far below the industry s expected growth rate of 15 8   Also  a PEG ratio of 1 17 makes the company slightly overvalued  indicating the possibility of downside going ahead 
However  we have picked a handful of stocks in the tech sector that are likely to ride the growth momentum while beating the odds

102558,324073,AVGO,How To Use Puts To Buy A Stock That Has Gapped Up,opinion,"Mastering both conservative option selling strategies  covered call writing and put selling will allow us to maneuver our way through most market situations  This past Wednesday  May 27  2015  several of the stocks on our BCI Premium Watch List gapped up  On last week s blog commentary  I addressed the situation with BRCM  NASDAQ BRCM  and AVGO  NASDAQ AVGO  and the merger rumors causing their meteoric price increases  Another gap up occurred with Synaptics  Inc   NASDAQ SYNA  as shown in the chart below 


SYNA gap up on May 27  2015

SYNA gapped up nearly  4 00 per share to  99 11  Was this an opportunity lost  Let s assume for a moment that we planned to buy SYNA at the  pre gap up price  of  95 00  Now we have a dilemma because share price is so much higher  One way to deal with this situation is to use our put selling skills  Below is a screenshot of a put options chain for SYNA pre market on May 28  2015 


Put option chain for SYNA on 5 28 15

We can sell the  95 00 put for the published price of  1 45  and  if exercised  buy the shares at a cost basis of  93 55  or we can sell the  97 00 put for the published price of  2 10 and  if exercised  buy the shares at a cost basis of  94 90  The beauty of this approach is that if the options are not exercised  we have leveraged this security to generate a significant cash flow  Next  let s feed the option chain information into the BCI Put Calculator 


Put calculations for SYNA

Note the following 

If unexercised  the  95 00 put generates an annualized return of 25 72 
If unexercised  the  97 00 put generates an annualized return of 36 71 
If exercised  the  95 00 put results in a cost basis of  93 55  a 5 61  discount from current market value
If exercised  the  97 00 put results in a cost basis of  94 90  a 4 25  discount from current market value
For both puts  the cash required to secure those puts is slightly less than the cash required to buy 100 shares at  95 00

Discussion

Mastering the skills of covered call writing and selling cash secured puts will allow us to deal with most market events  like the gap up of the price of a security we are interested in  By selling out of the money cash secured puts  strike price below current market value   we can craft our trade to buy the shares at the pre gap up price  If the trade is not executed  we still will have generated a significant cash flow  Another way to view this is that we either purchase the shares at our price or get paid not to buy that security 

Market tone

Growth Factors in the Second Quarter
Avago recently completed the acquisition of LSI Corporation for  6 6 billion in cash  The transaction diversified its existing business line from wired infrastructure  wireless and industrial businesses into the storage chip market  The strategic move was aimed at augmenting its revenues  as the industry braces for more consolidation amid a challenging macroeconomic environment  With annual revenues of approximately  5 billion  the combined company is expected to be one of the behemoths in the semiconductor industry  offering a complementary yet diversified product portfolio to a wider range of customers  Leveraging on economies of scale  Avago is expected to benefit from the rapid increase in data center IP  Internet protocol  and mobile data traffic  to emerge as the undisputed leader in the enterprise storage market  In addition to cost synergies from a combined resource pool as the cost of designing and building semiconductors rises  the acquisition is likely to improve the operating margin of the combined company  creating greater scale to further drive innovation into the datacenter  The transaction is expected to be accretive to Avago s free cash flow and recurring earnings  leading to annual cost savings of  200 million by fiscal 2015  With the acquisition  Avago has replaced LSI on the S P 500 after the close of trading on May 7  This has further raised investor confidence  who seek to own blue chip stocks 
Earnings Whispers
 Despite focused attempts to restructure its business  our proven model does not conclusively show that Avago is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key ingredients for a success recipe  Zero Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction or ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at 0 00   This indicates a likely in line earnings for the shares  Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Avago s Zacks Rank  3 reduces the predictive power of ESP  Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks of  1  2 and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  However  when combined with 0 00  ESP  the Zacks Rank  3 fails to conclusively predict an earnings surprise for Avago  Meanwhile  we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement
