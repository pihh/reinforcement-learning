bell In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 8   Moreover  the bottom line outpaced estimates in the trailing four quarters  the average being 5 8  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Key CatalystsWe are upbeat about Medtronic s successful execution of growth strategies  such as therapy innovation  globalization and increase in economic value  Combined with the demographics of an aging population  these positives opened up wide opportunities for the company  which might get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results The therapy innovation space has been seeing multiple developments  Under Cardiac and Vascular Group  CVG   new therapies are helping the company gain traction from the rapidly growing MedTech market for left ventricular assist device  transcatheter aortic valve replacement  drug coated balloons  atrial fibrillation ablation and insertable diagnostics Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise   There has been a gradually stabilizing trend in the global cardiac rhythm and heart failure  CRHF  market  In the fiscal second quarter  the company is expected to have registered strong growth in its ICD  implantable cardioverter defibrillator  and CRT  cardiac resynchronization therapy  product lines within the scope of CRHF  banking on product launch and creation of meaningful markets Strong demand for the company s Micra transcatheter pacing system  Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft  VenaSeal Closure System  TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope  Reveal LINQ product lines and a robust performance in TAVR franchise are steadily driving Medtronic s revenues within this niche  Further  following CMS  final TAVR NCD memo published in June  many new TAVR centers in the United States are entering into partnerships with Medtronic  This is also expected to have positively contributed to Medtronic s top line in the fiscal second quarter However  in the to be reported quarter  this growth is likely to have been offset by weakened sales of left ventricular assist device  LVAD  as a result of market share loss  due to the regulatory approval of Abbott s competitive product HeartMate 3  and certain unfavorable changes in the heart transplant guideline  This apart  sales might have taken a hit as the company is in its CRM replacement cycle Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVG revenues in the fiscal second quarter is pegged at  2 87 billion  indicating a 0 4  dip from the year ago reported number Within Restorative Therapies Group  RTG   the company is again projected to

Medtronic is likely to have sustained U S  patient demand for its MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system in the fiscal second quarter  Outside the United States  the company is witnessing buoyant demand for 640G system  It is continuing with the launch of MiniMed 670G in several international markets  which in turn  is expected to have consistently boosted its international diabetes revenues

129419,350934,ACAD,What s In The Cards For Bausch Health  BHC  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Bausch Health Companies Inc    NYSE BHC   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and full year 2018 results on Feb 20 
In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings beat estimates by 32 2   Bausch s earnings track record has been pretty decent so far  Over the last four quarters  the company beat earnings expectations thrice  delivering average positive earnings surprise of 83 2  
Bausch s stock has gained 19 5  in the past six months compared to  a 22 2  decline for the  
 
 
Factors Likely to Impact Results
Bausch conducts its business in four operating segments   the Bausch   Lomb International segment  the Salix segment  the Ortho Dermatologics segment and the Diversified Products segment 
The Bausch   Lomb International segment primarily comprises products with a focus on the vision care  surgical  consumer and ophthalmology Rx products  The Salix segment consists of sales of gastrointestinal products 
The Ortho Dermatologics segment consists of sales of Ortho Dermatologics  dermatological  products in the United States and global sales of Solta medical dermatological devices 
The Diversified Products segment comprises sales of pharmaceutical products in the areas of neurology and certain other therapeutic classes in the United States  generic products  and dentistry products 
Approximately 75  of the company s total third quarter revenues was generated by the Bausch   Lomb International and the Salix segments  Hence  the focus will be on these two segments in the fourth quarter  Revenues in 2018 are expected between  8 15 billion and  8 35 billion  The company expects R D expenses of  415 million in 2018 
The Salix business continues to drive growth and contribute to the top line  In particular  increased sales of Xiaflex and Relistor are boosting the segment  In August  Bausch launched Lucemrya for the mitigation of withdrawal symptoms to facilitate abrupt discontinuation of opioids in adults 
The company also entered into an exclusive agreement with Dova Pharmaceuticals  Inc  to co promote Doptelet in the United States for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure  Bausch also launched Plenvu  a one liter PEG bowel cleansing preparation for colonoscopies  in the United States 
Meanwhile  investors are expected to focus on pipeline development  apart from the regular top and bottom line numbers  Bausch has narrowed its focus on seven recently launched or expected to be launched products pending completion of testing and receipt of FDA approval  The products include Vyzulta  Siliq  Bryhali  psoriasis   Lumify  Duobrii  Relistor and SiHy Daily 
Bausch also obtained FDA approval for Vyzulta  a treatment option for glaucoma  The FDA also approved Lumify  the over the counter eye drop with low dose brimonidine for the treatment of eye redness  The approval of new drugs should boost the top line  The company successfully launched Lumify 
The FDA also approved Altreno  IDP 121   an acne treatment in lotion form  The company launched Bryhali lotion  a topical treatment for plaque psoriasis  following the receipt of final FDA approval  The FDA accepted the resubmission of the NDA for Duobrii Lotion for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis with a PDUFA action date of Feb 15  2019  The phase III studies for IDP 120 are expected to begin shortly and the company expects to submit an NDA for IDP 123 in the first half of 2019 
The focus will also be on the company s efforts to pay down debt  as it had been under the scanner for its huge levels of debt  During the third quarter  the company repaid  360 million of debt  Consequently  the company reduced debt by approximately  7 4 billion  since the first quarter of 2016  In January 2019  the company paid down an additional  100 million of its senior secured term loans using cash generated from operations 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Bausch will beat on earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP for Bausch is 0 00   This is because both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at 88 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Bausch carries a Zacks Rank  3  which is favorable  However  the 0 0  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies you may consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver a beat this quarter 
Mallinckrodt   NYSE MNK   has an Earnings ESP of  2 25  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is scheduled to report results on Feb 26  You can see  
ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ ACAD   has an Earnings ESP of  12 95  and a Zacks Rank  3  It is scheduled to release results on Feb 28 
Recro Pharma  Inc    NASDAQ REPH   has an Earnings ESP of  3 03  and a Zacks Rank  2  It is scheduled to report earnings on Feb 19

129437,350952,ACAD,Exelixis  EXEL  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Exelixis  Inc    NASDAQ EXEL   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 12  after the market closes 
Exelixis  shares have gained 7 6  in the past six months compared with the  decline of 13 5  

 
The company has an excellent earnings surprise history  surpassing expectations in all of the trailing four quarters with average beat of 83 43    In the last reported quarter  the company beat expectations by 115 79  
Let s see what is in store for this quarter 
Factors Likely to Impact Results
Strong Cabometyx sales boosted the company s third quarter results and we expect the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter  The company experienced 11  increase in Cabometyx s prescriber base in the third quarter as compared to that in the second quarter 
While the FDA approved Cabometyx tablets in April 2016 for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma   RCC    the drug s label was also expanded in December 2017 for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC  Since the drug is now approved for first line RCC as well  the company can now cater to the entire patient population suffering from the disease 
In May 2018  Exelixis and partner Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals also obtained the European Commission  EC  approval for Cabometyx  20 mg  40 mg and 60 mg  in the first line treatment of adults with intermediate  or poor risk advanced RCC  The approval will broaden the geographic reach of the drug as the market potential is significant for the first line treatment of kidney cancer 
Moreover  Exelixis and partner Ipsen obtained EC approval for Cabometyx as a monotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC  in adults who have previously been treated with Bayer s Nexavar  In January 2019  the FDA also approved Cabometyx for HCC 
In September 2018  Exelixis announced that the National Comprehensive Cancer Network  NCCN  has updated its Clinical Practice Guidelines to include new recommendations for lead drug Cabometyx  As a result of the update  Cabometyx is now recommended by the NCCN for the treatment of advanced RCC  regardless of patient risk status  favorable   intermediate  and poor risk  
We expect sales to get a further boost  with an increase in the eligible patient population for Cabometyx in the United States  However  competition has increased in the RCC market  with the approval of Opdivo combined with Yervoy for the treatment of poor and intermediate risk first line RCC 
Meanwhile  investors are expected to focus on pipeline development  In December 2018  Exelixis and Ipsen announced the initiation of a pivotal phase III study   COSMIC 312   to evaluate a Cabometyx combination therapy in treatment na ve advanced HCC  Moreover  an exploratory arm will also evaluate Cabometyx monotherapy in the first line setting for similar patients 
Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program  comprising more than 45 clinical studies across multiple indications  Exelixis inked agreements with Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY   and Roche to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents 
Earlier  Exelixis announced encouraging results from the dose escalation stage of the phase Ib COSMIC 021 study of Cabometyx in combination with Tecentriq in previously untreated advanced RCC  The combination was well tolerated and showed promising anti tumor activity 
Exelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2018 to be  410  420 million 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Exelixis will beat on earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP for Exelixis is  3 45   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 25 cents  while the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at 24 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Exelixis carries a Zacks Rank  2  which is favorable  However  the negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Exelixis  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

129438,350953,ACAD,Tilray  TLRY  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Tilray  Inc    NASDAQ TLRY   is expected to release fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 12 
In the last reported quarter  Tilray beat earnings expectations by 42 9   The company went public in July 2018 
Pipeline Progress in Focus
Tilray produces medical cannabis in Canada and Europe  In July 2018  Tilray completed its IPO  selling 10 350 000 shares of Class 2 common stock at  17 per share  C 22 45 per share   The company received net proceeds of  163 6 million  after deducting the underwriting discount 
The company has two product categories   dried cannabis  which includes whole flower and ground flower  and cannabis extracts  which includes full spectrum and purified oil drops and capsules  The company recorded 85 8  growth in revenues  driven by increased patient demand  bulk sales to other licensed producers and accelerated wholesale distribution in export markets  We expect the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter as well 
There is a global paradigm shift with regard to cannabis  As a result of this shift  the multi billion dollar cannabis industry is transforming from a state of prohibition to a state of legalization  Medical cannabis is now authorized at the national or federal level in 29 countries  Although the legal market for medical cannabis is still in its early stages  it represents huge potential  Recreational cannabis was legalized on Oct 17  2018  by the Federal Government 
In September 2018  Tilray announced that the U S  Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA  has approved an import pharmaceutical grade medical cannabis product produced by Tilray in the United States  for a clinical trial focused on Essential Tremor  ET   a neurological movement disorder  The drug will be imported from Canada for a clinical trial to be conducted at the University of California San Diego  UC San Diego  Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research  CMCR  to examine its safety  tolerability and efficacy for ET 
Tilray has been working to broaden its global footprint  In December 2018  Tilray announced that its subsidiary  Tilray Canada Ltd  has entered into a global framework agreement with the generic arm of Novartis   NYSE NVS    Sandoz AG  expanding the current collaboration  Under the new agreement  Tilray will collaborate with Sandoz to increase the availability of high quality medical cannabis products across the world  The company recently entered into a research partnership with world s leading brewer  Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV to research non alcohol beverages containing tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD 
The company recently entered into a marketing agreement with Authentic Brands Group  Both the companies have entered into a long term revenue sharing agreement to market and distribute a portfolio of consumer cannabis products within Authentic s brand portfolio  in jurisdictions where regulations permit 
In October 2018  Tilray acquired its existing Chile based import and distribution partner  Alef Biotechnology SpA  In December 2018  Tilray announced an investment in Qu bec based cannabis producer  ROSE LifeScience Inc   and an exclusive sale  supply  distribution and marketing agreement between High Park Farms Ltd   a wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray  and ROSE 
We expect investors to focus on other business updates from the company on the call  apart from the regular top and bottom line numbers 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tilray will beat on earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  45 46   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate stands at   0 24 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is   0 17  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell  before they re reported  with our

129441,350956,ACAD,Is A Disappointment In Store For Incyte  INCY  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 14  before the market opens 
In the last reported quarter  the company missed estimates by 5 0   Incyte s earnings track record has been disappointing so far  Over the last four quarters  the company missed earnings expectations thrice  delivering average negative earnings surprise of 6 75  Incyte Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Factors Driving Growth
Incyte s lead drug  Jakafi  ruxolitinib  is a first in class JAK1 JAK2 inhibitor  approved for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera   PV    and those with intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis   MF    including primary MF  post PV MF and post essential thrombocythemia MF  While Incyte markets the drug in the United States  it is marketed by Novartis   NYSE NVS   as Jakavi outside the country 
Incyte continues to gain traction from Jakafi s performance  Jakafi revenues summed  1 0 billion in the first nine months of 2018  up 21  from the year ago timeframe  driven by strong patient demand 
We expect the trend to continue in the fourth quarter  The company updated its sales guidance with the third quarter results  The company expects Jakafi revenues of  1 370  1 400 million  previous guidance   1 350  1 400 million  
In order to expand patient population and increase commercial potential of the drug  the company is working toward expanding Jakafi s label  further 
We expect investors to also focus on the pipeline development efforts  given the recent setbacks 
The FDA recently extended the review period of the supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for Jakafi to treat patients with acute graft versus host disease  GVHD  who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids   The sNDA was submitted in August 2018  and the FDA granted it both Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation  
However  the FDA extended the action date by three months to review additional data submitted by Incyte in response to the FDA s information requests  The additional data has been determined by the FDA to constitute a major amendment to the sNDA  Hence  the new Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  target action date is May 24  2019 
We remind investors that while Jakafi sales and royalties are key components of Incyte s revenue growth  Iclusig sales and Olumiant royalties are also contributing to the top line  Iclusig revenues are expected to be  80  85 million 
Earlier in the month  Incyte and partner Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY  announced that Olumiant  baricitinib  met the primary endpoint in two phase III studies   BREEZE AD1 and BREEZE AD2   evaluating the efficacy and safety of Olumiant monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  AD   Olumiant is already approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis   RA   in patients with inadequate response or intolerant to TNF inhibitor therapies 
The company also updated its guidance along with third quarter results announcement  R D expenses are now expected to be  993  1 038 million  down from  1 008  1 103 million projected earlier  SG A expenses are expected to be  370  385 million compared with the previous guidance of  340  355 million 
Meanwhile  Incyte entered into a collaboration agreement with China based Innovent Biologics  Inc 
Both the companies have entered into the agreement through their respective subsidiaries  for the development of three clinical stage product candidates   pemigatinib  FGFR1 2 3 inhibitor   itacitinib  JAK1 inhibitor  and parsaclisib  PI3K  inhibitor   All the three candidates were discovered and developed by Incyte 
Share Price Performance
Incyte s stock has gained 24 1  in the past six months  worse than the  s decline of 14 4  

 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Incyte will beat on earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  For Incyte  Earnings ESP is  17 82   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Incyte currently carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   While the company s positive ESP is favorable  an unfavorable rank makes surprise prediction difficult  Moreover  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5 going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

Factors to Consider
Zoetis derives majority of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals  The company continues to strengthen its diverse product portfolio through lifecycle innovations  strong customer relationships  and access to new markets and technologies 
The company s companion animal business has been performing well  Apoquel and other product launches continue to drive growth in companion animal portfolio  Key dermatology products Apoquel and Cytopoint  new products such as Simparica and Stronghold Plus  and increased medicalization rates in key international markets such as China and Brazil should propel further growth 
Zoetis expects to generate more than  500 million in combined sales from Apoquel and Cytopoint in 2018  Oral parasite Simparica is expected to witness further growth  The company also expects to see more favorable conditions for livestock 
In July  Zoetis completed the acquisition of Caifornia based Abaxis to augment its presence in the animal health diagnostics market  which is a fast growing portion of the animal health industry  This is anticipated to boost sales  Further  updates on this acquisition are expected during fourth quarter conference call 
We expect the company to throw more light other pipeline updates

129512,351027,ACAD,What s In The Cards For Adverum  ADVM  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Adverum Biotechnologies  Inc    NASDAQ ADVM   is expected to report third quarter 2017 results on Nov 14 
The company has a dismal track record as it missed estimates in three of the last four quarters  resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 11 95   In the last reported quarter  Adverum beat estimates  delivering a positive surprise of 27 03  
Also  Adverum s share price movement year to date indicates that the stock has outperformed the   The company s shares have gained 12 1  compared with the industry s gain of 2 3  

Factors to Consider
Adverum is a development stage biotech company with no approved product in its portfolio 
Adverum s pipeline consists of gene therapy programs for rare diseases  alpha 1 antitrypsin  A1AT  deficiency  wet AMD and hereditary angioedema   HAE    However  all the candidates are in pre clinical studies 
The company added multiple early stage candidates including ANN 043  ADVM 001   ANN 053  ANN 002  and ANN 003 among others with the acquisition of Annapurna Therapeutics in May 2016 
Based on pre clinical development results  the company is planning to advance its anti VEGF gene therapy candidate  ADVM 022  The candidate is being developed for treating wet age related macular degeneration   AMD    Adverum is in the process of filing a pre investigational new drug  IND   following its meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2017  The company is also developing another anti VEGF gene therapy  ADVM 032 
Adverum expects to initiate a phase I II study on ADVM 043 for the treatment of A1AT deficiency by the end of this year  The company filed an IND with the FDA and also met the agency in July for a review of the development plan 
Moreover  it is evaluating ADVM 053 to treat HAE and discussed a development plan with the FDA in the first quarter  It is preparing to file an IND 
Adverum extended its collaboration agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   by three years till May 1  2020  The companies will developeight distinct ocular therapeutic targets  including AVA 311  which is being developed for treating juvenile X Linked Retinoschisis 
The company has also collaborated with Editas Medicine  Inc    NASDAQ EDIT   for developing treatment for inherited retinal diseases using the latter s CRISPR based genome editing technologies 
We expect investor focus to remain on pipeline updates on the third quarter earnings call 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Adverum is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  But that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  3 33   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at a loss of 31 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of 30 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank   Adverum s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Adverum Biotechnologies  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are a couple of health care stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ ACAD   is scheduled to release results on Nov 7  The company has an Earnings ESP of  3 2  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see

129552,351067,ACAD,Horizon Pharma  HZNP  Q3 Earnings  A Disappointment In Store   revised ,opinion,"Horizon Pharma plc   NASDAQ HZNP   is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 6 
Last quarter  the company missed expectations by 16   Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter  
 
Horizon Pharma s shares have declined 12  in the year so far  underperforming the  s gain of 0 9  
Factors Likely to Impact This Quarter
Concurrent with the second quarter earnings  the company raised its outlook for 2017 and now expects sales in the range of  1 010  1 045 billion  compared to the earlier estimate of  985  1 020 billion 
Horizon Pharma is significantly increasing investments in one of its key growth drivers  Krystexxa  and projects peak sales of around  400 million in 2017 driven by higher demand  The guidance includes assumption of lower net average net realized price from the U S  Government s Health Resource and Services Administration s Final Rule on 340B drug ceiling price implementation scheduled for Oct 1  
The company expects continued double digit net sales growth for Ravicti in 2017  with room for additional uptake due to the recent label expansion  The drug is also expected to be launched in Europe in the second half  However  sales of Procysbi will decline due to the divestiture of European rights  Sales of Actimmune are projected to grow in low single digits driven by a year over year growth in the second half 
Meanwhile  Horizon Pharma s primary care business is under pressure due to the implementation of a new commercial model  where the company is teaming up with pharmacy benefit managers and payers to help patients obtain access to its medicines 
During the third quarter earnings call  focus will be on the performance of the business units  along with that of products like Actimmune and Krystexxa 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Horizon Pharma is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  8 48   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate is 21 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 22 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   
Zacks Rank  Horizon Pharma currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   As it is  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Horizon Pharma PLC Price and EPS Surprise

129578,351093,ACAD,Mallinckrodt To Begin Sarcoidosis Study On Acthar Gel,opinion,"Mallinckrodt plc   NYSE MNK   announced that it will initiate a new phase IV study on H P  Acthar Gel 
This multi center  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study will further assess the efficacy of Acthar as a therapy option in patients with symptomatic sarcoidosis  The study will evaluate Acthar as a later line treatment option for sarcoidosis patients with persistent disease 
The drug is already approved in the United States for this indication   The company is conducting the study to determine which class of patients will benefit the most from an alternative treatment like Acthar 
Acthar became part of the company s portfolio following the Questcor acquisition and is currently approved for 19 indications  Mallinckrodt is working on boosting Acthar sales in the approved indications including rheumatology and pulmonology as well as underserved patient populations  The company intends to invest in research and development activities for developing Acthar for indications like lupus  proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and diabetic nephropathy 
Performance of the drug has been impressive so far  propelled by solid demand for rheumatology  pulmonology  ophthalmology and nephrology  and expanded access in more recently promoted indications such as lupus and sarcoidosis  as well as mature indications such as infantile spasms and nephrotic syndrome 

Mallinckrodt s stock price has declined 28 0  year to date  compared with the  s  fall of 20 7  
We note that Mallinckrodt is currently focused on reshaping its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions and non core asset divestitures to transform the portfolio and become a high performing specialty pharmaceutical company  The company recently acquired privately held InfaCare Pharmaceutical Corp  This specialty pharmaceutical company focuses on the development and commercialization of proprietary pharmaceuticals for neo natal and pediatric patients 
The company s generic segment continues to face weakness as various product categories are witnessing stiff competition  which is hurting both volumes and prices  The company expects double digit declines in revenues from this segment  In addition  continued expected weakness in this segment will adversely impact gross profit margins also 
The company sold its Nuclear Imaging business due to persistent challenges  The company also sold its Intrathecal Therapy business to focus on key areas  While Acthar Gel sales continue to be strong on the back of increased formulary positions and access for appropriate patients in both the commercial and public environments  sales of Therakos are expected to decline

129579,351094,ACAD,Here s Why Intercept  ICPT  Stock Lost 37  So Far In 2017,opinion,"Shares of Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ICPT   declined 37 4  year to date against the  s gain of 15 4    In particular  shares have plunged 40 4  over a month due to safety issues regarding approved drug Ocaliva 

Per a recent news article  prescriptions of the drug have fallen by 25   The FDA issued a guideline regarding incorrect dosing of Ocaliva   The FDA reported 19 deaths due to Ocaliva  approved for primary biliary cholangitis  PBC  and stated that the drug may also affect the liver 
However  Intercept conducted an analysis and concluded that that these patients were prescribed once daily doses of Ocaliva  which is seven times higher than the recommended weekly dose  The analysis was conducted in consultation with the FDA  The company concluded that deaths occurred due to overdosing 
Consequently  Intercept issued the Dear Healthcare Provider letter  Thereafter  the FDA issued their own safety communication to reinforce recommended label dosing  Intercept is also working in tandem with the FDA to develop Ocaliva s label for safety purposes 
We note that Ocaliva was approved in the United States in May 2016  and subsequently in the European Union and Canada  for the treatment of PBC with an inadequate response to or intolerant to the standard of care  UDCA 
The dose recommended for earlier stage PBC patients with no or mild hepatic impairment was 5 mg once daily  which was increased after three months to 10 mg once daily based on tolerability and treatment response  On the other hand  in late stage patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment  Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis   recommended dosing starts at 5 mg once weekly  with the possibility to gradually increase to a maximum of 10 mg twice weekly 
The warning comes a major setback for Intercept and we expect the company s sales to be hurt in the third quarter due to the same  The company expected the drug s sales to improve in 2017 as international demand was projected to pick up in the second half  Ocaliva is the company s only approved drug and such side effects will limit the sales potential

Notably  closed triple combination therapy is not licensed as a single inhaler triple therapy anywhere outside the United States 
GlaxoSmithKline s shares are up 4  so far this year  comparing unfavorably with the 16 4  rally of the  during the period 

 
We remind investors that in November last year  GlaxoSmithKline and Innoviva announced filing of a regulatory submission for the triple combination therapy in the United States for the given indication  Good news is that the regulatory application was submitted around 18 months earlier than expectations 
Additionally  last December  GlaxoSmithKline and Innoviva had filed regulatory applications for the combination therapy in the EU 
The filing was based on data from the closed triple combination therapy development program as well as results of the phase III FULFIL study on FF  UMEC and VI  either alone or in combination  The study revealed superiority of the closed triple combination over Symbicort Turbohaler in improving lung function and health related quality of life in COPD patients 
Good news is that this month  European Medicines Agency s  EMA  Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  has adopted a positive opinion for the combination treatment 
Notably  the combination therapy is also under assessment across a number of other countries  including Australia and Canada

Shares of Ultragenyx have underperformed the  year to date  The stock has been dismally down 16 3  as against the industry s 7 2  gain during the period

We remind investors that in November 2016  Ultragenyx has also withdrawn its conditional filing application for Ace ER s regulatory approval in the EU for treatment of adult patients with GNEM  This conditional filing was withdrawn based on feedback from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  indicating that the submitted phase II study results were not sufficient to support the approval 
However  the company clarified that the discontinuation of Ace ER will not impact its overall strategies as it s already on a progressing track with several developmental activities and regulatory filings lined up ahead 
Notably  in July 2016  Ultragenyx announced positive top line data from a pivotal phase III study on recombinant human beta glucuronidase  rhGUS  for treating mucopolysaccharidosis 7  MPS 7   The candidate is presently under review in both the U S  and EU with responses expected on Nov 16  2017 and in the first half of 2018  respectively

129711,351226,ACAD,Best Biotech Stock Buys In January,opinion,"With the biotech sector going on sale due to its massive underperformance in the S P 500 year to date  it is likely to generate bargains 
This bargain will definitely draw in traders and investors  but which biotech company stocks are the best to buy for the beginning of 2017  Here are   four biotech stock highlights that we think would be the best buys as we welcome the coming year 
ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ACAD 
Acadia Pharmaceuticals is making a buzz in the biotech sector as its drug Nuplazid is the first and only FDA approved  Food and Drug Administration  treatment for Parkinson s disease Psychosis  PDP   While launching a new medicine to the market is difficult  the challenge isn t quite hampering when there isn t any rival to worry about 
Nuplazid was previously introduced only a few months back  but the early results are positive  Third quarter total sales poured in at  5 3 million  an amount that exceeded than double of analysts  expectations  This is seen as a good beginning for the biotech even if the total sales are nowhere near to balance the company s massive spending 
While the said drug has just hardly begun to penetrate into the PDP market  the Acadia management is also proposing for expanding Nuplazid s labeling 
Overall  Acadia gives investors a lot of reasons to believe that it will display an incredibly fast growth for the coming years ahead a long term gain  It is a recommended bet to get shares for Acadia while they are currently trading at a discount 
The ACAD stock finished the prior trading session at  29 750  up by 7 52  or  2 08 
Geron Corporation  NASDAQ GERN 
Geron comes as one of the sector s most intriguing long term value plays after suffering a market beat down in the year  While this biotech firm doesn t possess a product to offer to the market yet  its lead candidate  imetelstat  has generated attractive trial results that indicate it could potentially take over a somewhat underserved niche 
Its partner Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  is anticipating additional data from continued studies with the said drug next year  Should trial results for myelofibrosis  a bone marrow disorder that unsettles the body s normal production of blood cells  remain consistent with prior observations  the healthcare giant will aid in funding larger trials in order to support New Drug Applications 
As it stands  there is only one treatment for myelofibrosis  and that is Jakafi  manufactured by Incyte  According to third quarter earnings report  Jafaki has generated sales and royalty revenue at a year run rate of  1 01 billion  The drug has also gained the FDA approval in 2011 due to its capability to lower spleen size  which is a symptom of the disease 
But Geron s imetelstat is the first to reveal clear signs of decreased disease activity and even push the rare blood cancer to total diminution 
Currently  Geron s enterprise value is a mere  340 million  But with a partner ready to usher the lead drug through the regulatory pathway and eventually into the commercial scene  there is a likely chance Geron could offer great returns to persevering investors next year 
At Monday s close  GERN shares earned 5 39  or  0 110 to trade at 2 150 
Ligand Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ LGND 
Ligand Pharmaceuticals boasts of a market cap less than  3 billion with a deep pipeline  eight programs in late stage clinical studies and 18 more in mid stage levels  which is a considerable amount the competes better against other larger biotech firms 
The success behind this is Ligand s partnerships  the company has more than 90 partners and licenses for its drug development platforms  and many of which are the largest drug manufacturers in the market 
The appeal that comes with Ligand s products is that they aid biopharmaceutical firms develop new drugs more effectively  Captisol  its leading technology  possesses a chemical structure that enhances solubility  stability  bioavailability and dosing of active pharmaceutical components 
From January to September 2016  Ligand s revenue surged almost 40  in comparison to the same period last year  The biotech is seen to sustain this pace of growth for the next couple of years  supported by its solid pipeline and the soaring sales of Kyprolis and Promacta its current products 
LGND ended Monday s trading session with a gain of 3 12  or  3 14 to trade at 103 65 
Trevena Inc  NASDAQ TRVN 
The clinical stage biotech Trevena is scheduled to post top line results from two phase 3 studies  namely APOLLO 1 and APOLLO 2  for its lead drug in the first quarter of 2017  The said experimental drug  oliceridine  is an injected dose for the treatment of moderate to severe pain in post surgery 
Oliceridine should not be taken lightly because the acute pain market is enormous  and there s an urgent need for viable substitutes to addictive drugs like morphine  With these descriptions  this specific drug market has all the factors in place to possibly make a highly lucrative product such as oliceridine 
All the evidence so far indicates that this experimental drug is an effective pain reliever  which suggests that it may hit the mark in each trial regarding its primary point  the ability to beat placebo as a pain reliever  This is a feat achieved successfully in its mid stage trials that even led to a breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA previously in February 
However  oliceridine s value proposition depends on how well it stacks up against morphine in regards to safety and efficacy  the secondary standpoint in the trials  Should Trevena s drug generate a promising clinical profile relative to morphine  it may produce hundreds of millions in sales a great potential haul for a firm with a market cap of roughly  300 million 
Keep in mind that there is a gripping bear case surrounding the drug s ultimate commercial potential  Bears have shared that oliceridine s target market is just a minute fraction of the acute pain aspect  and the biotech company may not be able to persuade payers to cover for an obviously more costly drug than morphine 
In the previous Monday session  TRVN was last up by 3 11  or  0 18 to  5 97 ",2016-12-27,FSM News,https://www.investing.com/analysis/best-biotech-stock-buys-in-january-200170871,200170871

129743,351258,ACAD,Here s Why ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Is Up,opinion,"ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc   NASDAQ ACAD  is having an incredible day in the market today  and for good reason  Late Friday  the company announced positive news it had received from the FDA  One of the treatments the company has been working on has been approved  Today  we ll talk about that treatment  how the market reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from ACAD moving forward  So  let s get right to it 
ACAD Announces The Approval Of NUPLAZID
For some time now  ACADIA Pharmaceuticals has been working on a treatment for hallucinations and delusions that are associated with Parkinson s disease psychosis  That treatment is known as NUPLAZID or pimavanserin  On Friday  the company announced that the FDA has approved NUPLAZID as a Breakthrough Therapy to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson s disease psychosis  NUPLAZID is the first treatment of its kind  and the only FDA approved treatment designed for this indication  In a statement  Steve Davis  the President and CEO at ACAD had the following to say with regard to the approval   

NUPLAZID represents a major medical advancement for patients with Parkinson s disease psychosis who suffer from hallucinations and delusions    We are grateful to the many patients and investigators who participated in NUPLAZID s clinical studies  NUPLAZID represents the culmination of many years of work across our entire organization to bring this novel medicine  discovered by our scientists to patients in need 

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  Any time positive news is released with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the value of the company as a result  Adversely  when negative news is released  we can expect to see declines  Considering the fact that NUPLAZID has been approved  the news surrounding ACAD is overwhelmingly positive  As a result  we re seeing strong positive movement in the market surrounding the news  Currently  9 27   the stock is trading at  33 96 per share after a gain of  1 66 per share or 5 14  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion with regard to what we can expect to see from ACAD  The reality is that the FDA s decision to approve NUPLAZID is an overwhelmingly positive decision for ACADIA  Currently  there is a major medical need for the treatment the company is now approved to offer  According to the National Parkinson s Foundation  in the United States  there are about one million people that suffer from this condition and between four and six million around the world  It is estimated that about 40  of the patients that are dealing with Parkinson s disease also are forced to deal with Parkinson s disease psychosis  This means that ACAD has a relatively large audience for the treatment that it has created  Aside from NUPLAZID  ACAD has an incredibly strong company  They have a wide range of both approved treatments  and treatments that they are working on  With strong management  an incredible team  and great products  it only makes sense that this stock will soar from here

   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Neratinib in Focus
Puma Biotech has made significant progress with its lead candidate  neratinib  The candidate is currently under review  in both the U S  and the EU for the extended adjuvant treatment of HER2 positive early stage breast cancer that has previously been treated with Herceptin based adjuvant therapy 
We note that several phase II combination studies on neratinib for the treatment of breast cancer are currently underway 
At the time of announcing second quarter 2016 results  the company projected that net loss may narrow in the subsequent quarters due to continued reduction in clinical trial expenses and expenses associated with the completion of regulatory filings for neratinib  The company also expects its research and development expenses to decrease in subsequent quarters for the same reasons 
Being a development stage company  Puma Biotech does not have any approved product in its portfolio  Thus  investor focus should remain on updates pertaining to the development of neratinib

129770,351285,ACAD,ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Stock  Here s Why We re Seeing Gains,opinion,"ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ACAD  is having an incredible time in the market at the moment  and for good reason  The company recently announced incredibly positive news with regard to a treatment for Parkinson s Disease Psychosis that it has been working on for some time now  Today  we ll talk about the news  how the market is reacting  and what we can expect to see from ACAD 
ACAD Submits A New Drug Application 
On Monday  it was announced that ACADIA Pharmaceuticals had submitted a New Drug Application or NDA to the United States Food and Drug Administration  The NDA surrounds a treatment the company has been working on for quite some time  known as NUPLAZID  The treatment was designed for Parkinson s Disease Psychosis  According to ACAD  the drug  provides clinically meaningful benefit  with robust improvements observed across multiple measures of psychosis that were achieved without causing adverse effects to motor function  
What We re Seeing In The Market 
As investors  we know that any time there is news released with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see movement in the value of the stock associated with that company  Good news will lead to positive movement and bad news will cause declines  It s no secret that the news surrounding ACADIA is overwhelmingly positive news  As a result  we ve seen strong gains on the stock since Monday  Currently  9 31   ACAD is trading at  28 34 per share after a gain of  4 53 per share or 19 03  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I m expecting to see overwhelmingly positive movement out of ACAD  The reality is that what they ve done with NUPLAZID is absolutely amazing  Parkinson s Disease Psychosis is an incredibly common problem and as of today  the treatments used for it don t have anywhere near the amounts of benefits that we see from NUPLAZID  I ve been following the studies on the treatment since they started  and based on what I ve seen  ACAD has come up with something that s absolutely incredible here 
Now  it s one thing to have a solid treatment  but it s also important to look at the target market associated with the treatment when gauging the profitability of the treatment  In this particular case  the target market is gigantic  According to the National Parkinson Foundation  it is estimated that one million people in the United States and between four and six million people around the world suffer from Parkinson s disease  It is also estimated that of the millions of people suffering from the ailment  about 40  of them have Parkinson s Disease Psychosis  These people suffer with hallucinations  delusions  and a diminished quality of life  With that said  the new treatment offered by ACADIA is much needed in the treatment of Parkinson s disease and will likely lead to incredible amounts of sales 
All in all  ACAD is an incredible company that has created a much needed product  With a strong management team and a proven ability in medical innovation  I m expecting to see strong long run gains out of ACAD ",2016-03-30,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/acadia-pharmaceuticals-(acad)-stock:-here’s-why-we’re-seeing-gains-200123367,200123367
129792,351307,ACAD,Obagi Medical Products Acquired  These Biotechs May Be Next,opinion,Yesterday  Obagi Medical Products  OMPI  was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals  VRX  for  19 75 a share in an all cash deal  Last summer I covered in depth  acquisition rumors regarding Obagi  At the time  good private sources of mine confirmed that companies were interested in Obagi  I was informed by these sources that a well known large cosmetic company was very interested in acquiring the company for up to  22 50 a share  Based on the available information I had to work with at the time  I predicted that Obagi would see an acquisition soon  However  as I found out after there was no acquisition  the Obagi Board of Directors  BOD  was continuing to entrench themselves  refusing to open up the books to the potential suitor  Needless to say at the time  I was very frustrated with the events that were taking place with Obagi  as I strongly felt the BOD was neglecting its fiduciary duties  I was not alone in my frustrations  Enter in activist shareholder David Callan  who up to yesterday was a large block private shareholder of Obagi  I had the pleasure of meeting David both via a mutual acquaintance and speaking with him on the phone about the situation at Obagi  David was very upset with the company s BOD  and was prepared to take whatever legal steps he deemed necessary to see Obagi sold  With yesterday s acquisition now firmly in place  the Obagi acquisition story is for all intensive purposes  over  Because of the delay in the Obagi Acquisition  I have been hesitant to write on other companies I have heard through various sources have acquisition interest  However  in this article I will mention companies I believe will be acquired this year  based on my own speculation and some of the same chatter from the same sources who originally brought Obagi to my attention  Antares Pharma  ATRS  focuses on developing self administered parenteral pharmaceutical products  injectors   The company currently has an NDA pending with the FDA for OTREXUP  which is a self injector product for the delivery of methotrexate using Medi Jet technology for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  poly articular course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis  and psoriasis  An approval decision from the FDA is expected in October of this year  Many who follow me both on Seeking Alpha and twitter know that I used to own a good size block of shares in Antares  which I originally purchased in the summer of 2011  In December of the same year  I began to hear chatter than Pfizer  PFE  was interested in acquiring Antares  I did not think much of it at the time  until I saw a short time later that the company made a deal with Pfizer to partner on an unknown over the counter drug  I inquired back with my source at the time to ask him how solid the rumor was  and he felt it was  very solid   A few months later  the company  Jack Howarth  a former King Pfizer executive  as Vice President of Corporate Affairs  Additionally  I had a few conversations with Jack  where he said he owned over 400k shares of Antares  but was not  an official insider   I then speculated that Jack was appointed by Antares at the request of Pfizer  to in essence   bird dog  the company  Oct 2007 Alphapharma hires Howarth VP of Investor RelationsNov 2008 King acquires AlphapharmaJune 2009 King hires Howarth VP of Investor RelationsOct 2010 Pfizer acquires KingFeb 2011 Antares appoints Howarth VP of Corportate Affairs  Investor RelationsBased on Jack s above history and timeframe  and with Antares virtually assured approval of its current NDA in submission to the FDA  notwithstanding what sources have informed me in the past  I speculate that Antares will be acquired sometime this summer early fall  The main reason I believe Pfizer will acquire Antares is for its patent profile it holds in regards to biosimilars  Biosimilars biobetters  or follow on biologics  are terms used to describe officially approved subsequent versions of innovator biopharmaceutical products made by a different sponsor following patent and exclusivity expiry on the innovator product  biosimilars being  similar   biobetters being  better    Follow on manufacturers do not have access to the originator s molecular clone and original cell bank  the exact fermentation and purification process  or to the active drug substance  In other words  companies do not need to wait for patent expiration of a biologic to get its hands on the exact formulation  In fact  because biosimilars biobetters do not use the exact composition of the biologic drug it is  following after   it is not considered a  copy   therefore  it is not a generic  but a new composition capable of its own unique patent protection  Many large pharmas are gearing up for what I believe to be the wave of the future in biopharmas  biosimilars and biobetters  For those of you wonder how Pfizer might have got wind of Antares  patent profile  I would point out that Pfizer had a lawsuit engaged against Teva over epipen which was settled late last year  While I will not go into the exact details of this lawsuit  it s entirely possible that during the discovery phase of the litigation  Pfizer s lawyers might have seen something in Teva Antares patent profile that may have sparked Pfizer to approach Antares with an  unknown product  which subsequently led to a partnership deal with Antares for the product  A little more than 2 months afterwards  Antares  appointed  the former Pfizer King Corporate Affairs VP Jack Howarth to be its VP of Corporate Affairs    strange coincidence  or something more  As stated  I believe Antares will be acquired by Pfizer by the end of Summer  early Fall  for a price range between  6 50 and  9  and I plan to buy back in at some point before Summer of this year  AcelRx  ACRX  AcelRx focuses on therapies for the treatment of acute and breakthrough pain  The company s principal product candidate is ARX 01  a Sufentanil NanoTab PCA system  which has  successful Phase III  a 3rd Phase III data release is set for release in June of this year  clinical trials for acute post operative pain in patients in the hospital setting  AcelRx has basically up to this point been under my radar  That was until a source informed me that he was hearing strong back chatter about the company shopping itself around  along with institutions showing interest to purchase shares in the company  I decided to take a look at AcelRx to see if the rumor might hold any water  The  rumor  focuses on Adrian Adams who is Chairman of The Board  COB   just appointed recently in February  Adams is also the current CEO and President of Auxilium Pharmaceuticals  AUXL   joining that company in December  2011  Mr  Adam s pattern of joining companies and engaging in selling them is clear from what we read from Auxilium s website   Prior to joining Auxilium  Mr  Adams served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Neurologix  a Company focused on development of multiple innovative gene therapy development programs  Before Neurologix  Mr  Adams served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Inspire Pharmaceuticals  Inc   where he oversaw the commercialization and development of prescription pharmaceutical products and led the company through a strategic acquisition by global pharmaceutical leader Merck   Co  MRK    Inc  in May 2011  Prior to Inspire  Mr  Adams served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Sepracor Inc  from December 2006 until February 2010  Under his leadership  Sepracor conducted multiple strategic corporate development activities  including the in licensing of seven products and out licensing deals with two major pharmaceutical companies  prior to its acquisition by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co  Before Sepracor  Mr  Adams was President and Chief Executive Officer of Kos Pharmaceuticals  Inc  from 2002 until the acquisition of the company by Abbott Laboratories  ABT  in December 2006  During his tenure he led the transformation of Kos into a fully integrated and profitable pharmaceutical company with annual revenues approaching  1 billion  Mr  Adams graduated from the Royal Institute of Chemistry at Salford University in the U K   My source informs me that the company is being shopped around  and that there might be an interested party at this time  Considering Mr  Adams executive history from above  I give the rumor relayed to me a lot of credit  As mentioned  AcelRx has had two recent successful Phase III data releases  with a 3rd upcoming Phase III data release in June  which is expected to produce positive results  Because of this  the company has become considerably de risked  The post operative pain market in the United States  Europe  and Japan has been growing steadily over the last few years and is expected to reach  6 5 billion by 2018  Acelrx s Nanotab tech could potentially grab a significant piece of this market  especially in the hands of a larger pharma that could leverage it with substantial capital to introduce the product correctly to the market  With Obama care basically subsidizing healthcare as we know it  there will be more incentive for companies to produce new and innovative drugs and treatments  with a design to offer care to most people at an affordable price  With insurance companies receiving more government money subsidy under Obama care  there should be more patient coverage which would support and pay for new products and treatments as well  Nanotab  if introduced correctly to market  should be a product that benefits from Obama care  AcelRx s market cap of  106 44M is a dirt cheap for a company that is significantly de risked  I would expect an acquisition price at a minimum premium of 70  of its current market cap  With the first two companies  I have the same source that introduced me to Obagi s potential buy out  The following two companies have no solid rumors that I am aware of connected to them  but do have some buy out buzz associated with them  and make for attractive acquisitions  Sarepta  SRPT  Sarepta focuses on the discovery and development of RNA based therapeutics for the treatment of rare and infectious diseases  Its lead product candidate is eteplirsen  designed to treat Duchene muscular dystrophy  DMD   The drug is currently under review by the FDA for accelerated approval  and a decision is expected by the middle of this year  Valuation is the name of the game in speculative Biotech  and finding companies that have high upside as well as mitigated risk is not only a challenge for investors  but big pharma as well  One such company is Sarepta  and many reading this article are undoubtedly familiar with its lead drug eteplirsen and its clinical success treating DMD  The drug alone makes Sarepta a very attractive candidate to be bought out  Recent struggles by Glaxo Smith Kline s  GSK  drug drisapersen highlight both the desire and difficulty that big pharma is having trying to enter this space  One additional caveat to consider is that most Americans have some knowledge of DMD as a disease  if treated  would garner a tremendous amount of positive Press coverage  Companies like Pfizer and Bristol Meyers Squib  BMY  could see eteplirsen as a way to bolster their reputations as well as their bottom line  Another reason that I think an acquisition bid could be in order for Sarepta is because when a company has tremendous stock appreciation in a short amount of time or a dramatically positive event  sometimes management does not have experience in executing the  next step   Sarepta s management was previously operating as a developmental company versus one ready to go to the next level  At minimum  bringing in some high profile resume s or the completion of a partnership would seem reasonable  if not a full buyout  Acadia Pharmaceuticals  ACAD  Acadia is a developmental biopharma that focuses on the development of drugs for central nervous system disorders  Acadia shares have been on the rise from the  1 50 range to a close of  6 65  on 3 20 13   Acadia has drug candidates for the treatment of Parkinson s disease  Alzheimers  schizophrenia  and glaucoma  These conditions are all connected with large market size and present significant opportunities for big pharma  Acadia has shown ability in the past to partner or collaborate with larger companies such as Biovail  Allergan  and Meija Seika Kaisha  LTD  It is not being overly presumptive to assume that big pharma would have interest in Acadia for its lead drug pimavanserin  which possess potential for massive revenue in multiple applications  On Tuesday of this week  Acadia received new coverage from Jefferies who initiated the company as a  Buy  with a  13 price target  The firm says notes that pimavanserin is a drug for which there is currently no FDA approved counterpart  Jefferies also commented on Acadia being a highly attractive licensing acquisition target for big pharma companies  I will be interested in seeing what happens this year regarding the companies listed  My source s  ultimately proved to be correct regarding Obagi  and I believe he they will be right about Antares and AcelRx  Certainly  the condition of The United States economy along with anticipated health care measures should have an effect on big pharma s appetite for acquisitions    something we all should watch closely  Disclosure  I am long ACRX ,2013-03-21,Scott

129794,351309,ACAD,3 Small Cap Biopharmas Primed To Move Much Higher Now,opinion,With the current record market run  small cap biopharma stocks have kept pace and continue to trend higher  being one of the best sectors for both trading and investing over the past year  With   2012 showed the most new approvals since 1996  In this article  I list three companies I believe will exceed this current trend moving forward  Aveo Pharma  AVEO  A Food and Drug Administration  FDA  Advisory committee will convene on May 2nd to vote for or against recommending tivozanib for approval  Tivozanib is a low molecular weight inhibitor of the VEGF receptor designed for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma  RCC   which is more widely known as kidney cancer  In January of this year  the company reported positive  from a study of 517 patients with RCC  The study compared tivozanib to sorafenib  which is the current front line treatment for RCC  Sorafenib is marketed by Onyx Pharmaceuticals  ONXX  under the trade name of Nexavar    global Nexavar net sales  in 2011  Perhaps the most important positive quality of tivozanib is the fact that patients tolerated the drug very well  Dose reductions of the drugs compared were 11 6  with tivozanib versus 42 8  with sorafenib  PThis is a clear indicator that patients tolerated tivozanib much better than sorafenib  Patient tolerability is perhaps the most important deciding factor for physicians to prescribe a drug other than efficacy  If a patient discontinues use of a drug  any possible benefit from the drug is obviously lost  I am very confident that the adcomm will recommend Tivozanib for approval  but yet the stock has a healthy amount of short interest in it  Simply stated  the bears have it wrong here with tivozanib and are misunderstanding the lack of impact the overall survival  OS  numbers will have on the FDA s decision to approve the drug  First off  the OS for tivozanib was 77  versus 81  for sorfenib  which is statistically about the same  The Phase III head to head study was based on one way crossover to the experimental therapy after disease progression in the control arm  According to   Crossover studies are a type of clinical trial in which the study participants receive each treatment in a random order  With this type of study  every patient serves as his or her own control  Crossover studies are often used when researchers feel it would be difficult to recruit participants willing to risk going without a promising new treatment  A one way cross over study is a trial design that is used in cases where two treatments are administered successively in the same group of trial subjects  The company  tivozanib because more than 60  of the patients randomized to the Nexavar arm  crossed over  to receive tivozanib or some other therapy upon tumor progression  These Nexavar crossover patients might be surviving at a higher rate because they benefited from receiving treatments with two active kidney cancer drugs  Furthermore  many  test subjects  were from Central and Eastern Europe  and access to good treatment options for RCC are limited in this part of the world  In North America and Western Europe where better treatment options exist  longer OS was observed  It s worth noting that there are nine analysts covering Aveo who have an  of  11 30  If tivozanib is approved by the FDA  my one year price target opinion is  15  based on its current price of  7 55  representing a market cap of  328 68M  Potentially  tivozanib could rake in yearly average sales of near  1B when considering sorfenib generated over  1B in 2011  After reviewing the Aveo s website  the company seems to be highly confident that tivozanib will be approved by the FDA  and are taking the necessary prudent steps to ensure the product garners success  Under   clicking  view all open job positions  shows three pages of new positions  a majority of which are  Oncology Sales Specialist  positions and located all across the United States  Aveo is clearly confident tivozanib will be approved  as am I  In addition  the  notes a  4 6 million increase in salaries  benefits  and other hiring costs in 2012 due to an overall increase in personnel in preparation for the potential launch of tivozanib  This was while completing a restructuring in October which included laying off forty eight people  With the company claiming it still had an  overall increase in personnel   clearly a new type of employee had to be hired  A good portion of this includes the new sales force the company is still actively recruiting along with other people experienced in new product roll outs  Aveo also has more drugs in its clinical pipeline  and an approval of tivozanib would give this pipeline more validity  which should equate to higher investor speculation  Considering the near term large catalyst event of an Acomm combined with the factors I mention  Aveo has the potential to double from its current price in the next year or so  Acadia  ACAD  Acadia Pharmaceuticals has been surging higher lately on huge volume relative to what is typical for the company  I wrote about Acadia  talking about its takeover potential as well as its amazing run from  1 50 to  6 50 share  Incredibly  as of close of business just four business days later  3 26 13   the shares were trading at  8 23  Acadia is a developmental biopharma that focuses on the development of drugs for central nervous system disorders  The company has drug candidates for the treatment of Parkinson s disease  Alzheimer s  schizophrenia  and glaucoma  These conditions are all connected with large market size and present significant opportunities for big pharma  Acadia appears to be drawing interest from big pharma because of its lead drug pimavanserin  which possesses potential for massive revenue in multiple applications  The surge in the past week can be mainly attributed to the  positive Phase III 020 results for pimavanserin in patients with Parkinson s disease psychosis  This was announced at the Emerging Science session of the 65th American Academy of Neurology  AAN  Annual Meeting  The analysis of the full data set from the Phase III  020 Study showed Meeting  The analysis of the full data set from the Phase III  020 study showed robust and consistent efficacy of pimavanserin across a wide array of study measures and confirmed the positive top line results previously reported   The significant and consistent results observed across measures in the Phase III  020 study are impressive and potentially very encouraging for Parkinson s patients who suffer from the psychosis frequently associated with this disease   said the presenter Dr  Jeffrey Cummings  M D   Sc D   Director of Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health   Importantly  regardless of whether assessments were performed by independent blinded raters  site investigators  or caregivers  clear benefits were observed and clinical measures were well aligned  The results of this study suggest that a selective  non dopaminergic based therapy has the potential to transform the standard of care by providing an effective  safe and well tolerated treatment for patients suffering from this large unmet medical need  As I referred to in my prior article  Acadia recently received  from Jefferies who initiated the company as a  Buy  with a  13 price target  The firm notes that pimavanserin is a drug for which there is currently no FDA approved counterpart  Jefferies also commented on Acadia being a highly attractive licensing acquisition target for big pharma companies  As an added bonus for the company  it has  108 million in cash and short term investments plus no debt as of 12 31 2012  This gives the company extra leverage in any possible partnership or acquisition talks  Also with this cash position  the company is far more de risked than other developmental biopharmas  Acadia likely has a lot of gas left in the tank to drive the stock price higher in the short term  Sarepta  SRPT  The buzz on Sarepta continues as the stock seems to climb on a daily basis  Sarepta is working on what many consider to be a huge break through with its clinical drug eteplirsen  an antisense PMO based therapeutic for the treatment of individuals with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  DMD   A big reason the stock continues to climb is because epteplirsen is currently being evaluated for accelerated approval  If the FDA decides to grant accelerated approval  DMD patients will finally have a drug that can help them live better lives  and owners of the stock will certainly see better equity returns The worst part about DMD is that it only affects children  affecting roughly around 1 in 3 600 boys  Over the years  many of us have watched the Jerry Lewis telethons on television  To see children suffer from various forms of Muscular Dystophy is heart wrenching  Philanthropist investors are also watching and Sarepta is the kind of company that attracts them in droves  which subsequently drives the stock price higher  Some might argue that accelerated approval would only temporarily drive the stock price much higher  only to see the stock price retrace near to where it started  Regardless  I would like to see an acceptance of the drug now so that children who need eteplirsen can receive it  Because of the current political scope  good efficacy  and positive safety data  eteplirsen should see an accelerated approval  There is no question in my mind that once the drug gains early approval  the stock will gap up at least 50  from its current levels  and likely will not hold that gap in the short term  The question for those currently holding the stock is whether to wear a trader s hat and take the profit  or put on an investor s hat and simply hold the stock for the long term  If you are a philantrophist  you are likely well off investing in Sarepta to be part of something potentially life changing  However  if you are a trader  your main concern should be profits   period  Sarepta is a story stock  and story stocks can either make you a ton of money  or leave you holding a massive bag  Dendreon  DNDN  stock holders unfortunately became familiar with this  Dendreon saw an epic stock price run on speculation for its prostate cancer vaccine provenge  The stock ran from around  5 to  57 in a short period of time  only to come crashing back down when people realized that  the provenge story  did not measure up to the actual reality of the drug  Insurance companies were not informed of provenge s pricing  and subsequently  many of them did not support the drug  To this day  Dendreon s stock price is nowhere near the highs it saw 3 years ago  and company management is still trying to get its act together  Sarepta s story is different than Dendreon s  Eteplirsen is potentially one of the biggest breakthroughs in a generation  and again  DMD affects young children who have a whole life ahead of them  Let s hope for their sake that eteplirsen gains accelerated approval    it s good for everyone  2013 is sure to either meet or exceed 2012 s drug approval rate  and both traders and investors who pick the right companies should enjoy some serious monetary gains  Disclosure  I am long AVEO  Disclaimer  This article is intended for

129795,351310,ACAD,Thursday s BioPharma Movers,opinion,Today  I have compiled a small list of biopharmas I feel offer strong upside potential in short and midterm  Some have event catalysts quickly approaching  while others are strong speculation investments  As we draw closer to  sell in May and go away   the market will become more stock picker orientated  Making the right trades and investments during this period will be crucial for portfolio appreciation Aveo Pharma  AVEO A Food and Drug Administration  FDA  Advisory committee will convene on May 2nd to vote for or against recommending tivozanib for approval  Tivozanib is a low molecular weight inhibitor of the VEGF receptor designed for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma     which is more widely known as kidney cancer In January of this year  the company reported positive  from a study of 517 patients with RCC  The study compared tivozanib to sorafenib  which is the current front line treatment for RCC  Sorafenib is marketed by Onyx Pharmaceuticals  ONXX  under the trade name of Nexavar    global Nexavar net sales topped over  1billion in 2011 Tivozanib should receive a positive recommendation from the FDA Adcomm  so I would expect to see a stock price of  8 50 or higher as we get closer to the Adcomm date in May  AVEO is also a strong acquisition target for a larger pharma as tivozanib might eventually be approved to treat such diseases as triple negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT On Monday April 15th  the FDA asked Sarepta to provide additional information on the drug  eteplirsen  to consider early approval  Eteplirsen is an antisense PMO based therapeutic for the treatment of individuals with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy    After shares initially gaped up on the news  they slid back down to the mid  30 dollar range  Many investors took this news as a negative  I take the news as actually positive  If the FDA had no intention to grant an early approval for the drug  the organization would not be asking for more information from the company  To date  every study shows that the drug is successful  and being that DMD is so debilitating  and effects only children  it s a good bet the FDA will in fact grant early approval  By asking for more information from the company  the FDA wants to be sure they are doing the right thing in granting early approval  in my opinion There is no question in my mind that once the drug gains early approval  the stock will gap up at least 50  from its current levels  so Sarepta at its current price range offering a nice entry point for both investors and traders  This delay in early approval should allow for a longer period of slow price appreciation  which I believe offers a great midterm investment opportunity ACADIA Pharmaceuticals  ACAD On Thursday April 11th  ACADIA  that the FDA has agreed to allow the company to file a New Drug Application  NDA  for the treatment of Parkinson s disease psychosis     The FDA agreed that the data from the pivotal Phase III  020 study  together with supportive data from other studies with pimavanserin  were sufficient to support the NDA filing On the news  the stock gaped up from a prior session s close of  7 97 to close the next trading session at  13 10  Since then  the stock has pulled back a bit  currently trading around  12 a share PDP is a large unmet need market  and could bring the company billions in revenues  which would support a much higher valuation from the current levels  It is also possible the FDA will allow an expediated review based on the fact that there are currently no treatments on the market for PDP  A stock price north of  20 a share is possible this year if everything pans out for the company  and I think it will Antares Pharma  ATRS I continue to maintain that Pfizer  PFE  will acquire Antares sometime before the end of this year Pfizer and Antares already have a working relationship in the form of a  secret deal  that I speculate is an Advil gel based formulation  Company CEO Paul Wotton mentioned last year that Pfizer came to Antares to inquire about one of Antares products  but company Vice President Jack Howarth said that Antares sought out Pfizer for the same deal  Someone is obviously  mistaken  here  I first heard the buyout rumors surrounding Antares in December of 2011  well before the company  appointed  Jack Howarth as a Vice President  Jack is not an official  insider  at Antares  yet has informed some Antares investors that he holds over 400 000 shares of the company  So who does Jack work for  Jack s last official job was with King Pharma  a company Pfizer acquired a few years ago The main reason I believe Pfizer will acquire Antares is for its patent profile it holds in regards to biosimilars Biosimilars biobetters  or follow on biologics  are terms used to describe officially approved subsequent versions of innovator biopharmaceutical products made by a different sponsor following patent and exclusivity expiry on the innovator product  biosimilars being  similar   biobetters being  better   Follow on manufacturers do not have access to the originator s molecular clone and original cell bank  the exact fermentation and purification process  or to the active drug substance In other words  companies do not need to wait for patent expiration of a biologic to get its hands on the formulation  In fact  because biosimilars biobetters do not use the exact composition of the biologic drug it is  following after   it is not considered a  copy   therefore  it is not a generic  but a new composition capable of its own unique patent protection  Many large pharmas are gearing up for what I believe to be the wave of the future in biopharmas    biosimilars and biobetters Antares has been locking down patents for the past few years with biosimilars  and many speculate the company has a raftload of these patents secured  Since biosimilars are likely to be the future of biopharma  Antares has placed itself as a strong acquisition target  and as mentioned  I believe Pfizer will be the buyer Also  starting in June  there will be warrant expiration occuring  Last year I predicted that Antares would see a pop in its stock price to over  5 a share when the stock was selling for around  3  I based my prediction primarily on the fact of warrant expiration at the time I am predicting a similar occurrence this year  and expect a price approaching  5 by the middle of this summer  Afterwards  I believe the company will be acquired for a price between  7 to  9 a share  Therefore  I have taken a position in Antares for a midterm investment Disclosure  I am long ATRS  AVEO  Disclaimer  This article is

129820,351335,ACAD,Investors Note Acadia Pharmaceuticals  Late Stage Progress,opinion,Acadia Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ  ACAD  has pulled back only slightly after pushing new highs on the prospects of its flagship Parkinson s Disease Psychosis treatment  Pimavanserin   which is now undergoing phase III trials  The development of pimvanserin also includes a program for schizophrenia and Alzheimer s disease  which have progressed into phase II trials Though our knowledge of structure and location of neurotransmitter receptors is incomplete  Acadia has developed a molecule that is able to block the activity of receptors that are suspected links to certain psychiatric disorders  The market potential for the treatment of these disorders  on paper  looks enormous  Take Abilify  Aripiprazole   which now generates around  5 5 billion in annual revenue for Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE  BMY  as a treatment for schizophrenia  and as a secondary medication for more common disorders like manic depression  Pimavanserin is an inhibitor of a certain class of serotonin receptors  which means that it inhibits the normal biochemical activity of serotonin in certain areas   and may have diverse applications like many of the blockbuster drugs that are generating billions every year  Pimavanserin was specifically tailored to be a potent inhibitor of serotonin receptor 5 HT2A  which is a specific receptor in the brain that is thought to play a vital role in patients that experience psychosis  The 5 HT2A receptor was originally known for being the target receptor of hallucinogens like LSD  but contemporary studies have noticed biochemical downregulation of 5 HT2A under the effects of classical antipsychotic medications  In simpler terms  we saw traditional antipsychotics inhibit the activity of 5 HT2A  which leads us to believe that direct inhibition of 5 HT2A might work as an unconventional antipsychotic treatment At first glance  Pimavanserin now sounds incredible to investors  because an older  which implies  inferior  in some cases  compound like Aripiprazole has the capacity to generate  5 5 billion a year  ACADIA s market capitalization  being about  140 million  would probably be undervalued if Pimavanserin could manage just 3 or 4  of Abilify s sales  Unfortunately  looking at past examples  you can see that even small percentages of big pharma s market share in anti psychotics are very hard to grab  This is also assuming that Pimavanserin  or any other competing drug  would be approved by the FDA in the first place Even though the antipsychotic drug market has ballooned to an astounding  20  billion in annual sales this year  the presence of the big pharmaceutical companies  with their enormous marketing budgets  can prevent most competition from getting any profit whatsoever in the development of antipsychotics  Taking this obstacle into account  we are now looking at pimavanserin with healthy skepticism To add more perspective  we go back to pimavanserin s biggest blunder In 2009  pimavanserin failed to meet the primary endpoint in its first pivotal phase III trials which immediately sent shares of ACAD into a violent selloff  The primary endpoint for the study was a statistically significant change in the mean of SAPS  Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms  scores from baseline  What wasn t really conveyed in the headline was the fact that the 40 mg pimavanserin arm  the group with the highest dose  did outperform on the SAPS  but it wasn t by enough The new phase III trial has been tweaked to highlight differences between the placebo and pimavanserin arms  and should address other issues that may have tampered with the trial s outcome  We are obviously expecting pimavanserin to meet its primary endpoint this time  In addition to that  we are going to see the conclusion of pimavanserin s phase III safety study in December 2012  which paves the way for an NDA submission in 2013 At this point  the big question we want to ask is whether or not pimavanserin is going to sell in the even that it does hit the market  Is there another  inverse 5 HT2A agonist  that would directly threaten pimavanserin I did find a few molecules that are blocking 5 HT2A receptor  but there aren t any other marketed  or developing  inverse agonists for 5 HT2a receptors other than an interesting molecule called Nelotanserin  which was a failed insomnia drug that was abandoned in 2008 by Arena Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ  ARNA   and another failed sleeping pill called Ciltyri  eplivanserin  which was started and abandoned by Sanofi Aventis  NYSE  SNY   Pimavanserin  as an inverse agonist  which does a little more than inhibit its targeted receptor and actually triggers an  opposite response   could have some niche potential when it has to compete for the treatment of schizophrenia and Alzheimer s disease psychosis The most important aspect of pimavanserin s appeal  by far  is its potential as a treatment for Parkinson s disease psychosis  PDP   The Parkinson s Disease Foundation provides some eye popping incidence statistics for Parkinson s Disease  with estimates of 7 10 million affected worldwide and about 60 000 new diagnoses each year in the United States alone  If we take a very conservative chunk  maybe 500 000  and multiply by the NIH s 40  estimate of Parkinson s patients affected by PDP  instead of Acadia s looser 60  estimate   we have 200 000 To account for off label substitutes and untreated people  we ll cut that population  If the average Parkinson s patient spends about  2 500 a year on medication  we are looking at a fair  conservative estimate  250 million year market for medications  If pimavanserin can manage an FDA approval  that implies at least  5 share for ACAD in a rational market  After approval  if pimayanserin had the chance to saturate the broader PDP market while taking market share from off label usage of other antipsychotics  we d see plenty of room for additional upside ,2012-10-02,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investors-note-acadia-pharmaceuticals'-late-stage-progress-138421,138421
129821,351336,ACAD,ACADIA Investors Await Clinical Trial Results For Pimavanserin,opinion,Shares of Acadia Pharmaceuticals  ACAD  have recently given back a lot of the gains that were made earlier in the year   especially those from September  to bring total YTD gains to 99  With the gains made this year  ACAD has reached a market capitalization of  122 million  This jump in the valuation of the company is primarily based on the implied market potential of its flagship compound Pimavanserin  which is finishing phase III trials for the treatment of Parkinson s Disease Psychosis  PDP   and phase II trials for schizophrenia and Alzheimer s Disease Psychosis  ADP  Acadia has two other compounds in the clnical development stage called Adrenergic and Muscarinic  for the treatment of chronic pain and glaucoma  respectively  but since collaborator Allergan has the commercialization rights to these  Acadia is limited to milestone payments and royalty fees when if these drugs reach the market Pimavanserin works as an inhibitor of a specific serotonin receptor known as 5 HT2A  which has been associated with the altered brain chemistry in patients experiencing psychosis in certain studies  Contemporary studies have also noticed suppression of 5 HT2A related activity with traditional antipsychotic medications  which implies that there is an obvious link between this specific serotonin receptor and psychosis  This is why Acadia sees potential for Pimavanserin in a variety of patients that experience psychosis  There are no other 5 HT2A inhibitors being marketed or in development at this point  although there are failed compounds that targeted 5 HT2A A lot of investors were discouraged at the results of Pimavanserin after it failed its first phase III trial in 2009 for Parkinson s Disease Psychosis  although there seems to be a renewed hope that the upcoming phase III results  which are due before the end of the month  will finally prove the compound s efficacy and allow the drug to increase significantly in value The headline results from 2009 implied that pimavanserin s Parkinson s Disease Psychosis program was in big trouble  which was reflected adequately in the enormous selloff that followed the initial results of the trial   but there is some hope that the upcoming trial results will have a different outcome  The original results  from 2009  did imply that the 40 mg pimavanserin arm did outperform the placebo arm by the efficacy measure that was used   the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms  SAPS   but the improvement wasn t quite good enough to achieve a statistically significant p value  While the trial did technically fail  the results weren t completely negative or useless  According to Acadia s statements  the company also adjusted their recent phase III pimavanserin PDP trial to give the drug a better chance at achieving statistically significant improvement versus the placebo arm  Overall we believe that the optimized  020 study design has enabled sites to enroll patients with the desired clinical profile and should significantly improve the likelihood of achieving a successful outcome  Roger Mills  Acadia Pharmaceuticals Q3 Earnings Conference CallThe phase III results that are due before the end of this month  November  will be from something that the company refers to as the   020 study   although there are two others that will prove vital data towards pimavanserin s eventual NDA submission  Acadia is planning to put pimavanserin through a trial they re referring to as the   021  study  which will use results from the  020 study to optimize the trial design and find the best way to provide favorable results for pimavanserin s efficacy profile in PDP treatment  Another trial  known as the  015 study  will continue to build the safety profile of pimavanserin as it progresses towards an NDA submission for PDP Although investors may still worry about the old phase III results that the company presented in 2009  an event that Acadia still hasn t fully recovered from   there is enormous potential given that the drug can achieve FDA approval  With no approved treatments available for an estimated pool of 150 000 400 000 PDP patients  not including the rests of the  1 million Americans that have Parkinson s disease   there is enormous market potential for this drug given the huge number of people that could benefit from an effective treatment  Even more exciting is the unmet demand in Alzheimer s Disease  the most common neurodegenerative disease in the population   If Pimavanserin can demonstrate efficacy in PDP treatment in the upcoming results from the  020 trial  long term investors that haven t been following ACAD should give some attention to the stock for its appreciation potential as we wait for an NDA submission and potential FDA approval ,2012-11-27,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/acadia-investors-await-clinical-trial-results-for-pimavanserin-145071,145071
129822,351337,ACAD,Acadia Rockets Into The Stratosphere On Clinical Trial Data,opinion,Yesterday morning we finally got to see the much anticipated data for ACADIA Pharmaceuticals   ACAD  phase III trial  which tested its flagship drug pimavanserin in the treatment of Parkinson s Disease Psychosis   Reacting to the news  ACAD stock rallied into the stratosphere and tacked on an incredible 136  by the closing bell   bringing the stock from  2 28 share to  5 43 share in a single trading session  This was a welcome relief for long term ACAD investors  who may have had positions decimated back in 2009 when pimavanserin failed its first phase III trial in the treatment of Parkinson s Disease Psychosis  ACAD stock briefly touched the speculative highs made back in 2009  but profit taking did cut down some of the enormous gains made in the stock yesterday   Pimavanserin s clinical trial met its primary endpoint with a large degree of confidence  p 0 001   The primary endpoint was based on improvement in the 9 item SAPS PD scale  a  Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms  index   which is the same measurement scale that was used for pimavanserin in its failed trial from 2009  The secondary endpoint  which was based on measurements of motor function in Parkinson s patients that received pimavanserin  was also met with high levels of confidence  The study used the Unified Parkinson s Disease Rating Scale  UPDRS  to measure the motoric tolerability in PDP patients on pimavanserin  which showed that the drug was able to maintain stability in motor function relative to placebo   This endpoint was also strengthened with results gathered using something known as the CGI I scale  the Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale  which observes the overall illness of the patients  and implies some extra evidence of pimavanserin s overall safety efficacy profile   ACADIA stated that there were issues with the structure of the old phase III trial that could be addressed in the next trial  and it seems that they were right   The results were very good  and showed that pimavanserin is probably going to be the first true Parkinson s Disease Psychosis treatment  This will address the substantial unmet demand for a significant fraction of the  1 million that are affected by Parkinson s Disease  and also provides some hope for the drug in other indications as well  Pimavanserin is also being developed for the treatment of psychosis in Alzheimer s Disease  as well as schizophrenia   Pimavanserin s mechanism of action  MoA  is based on a specific serotonin receptor known as 5 HT2A which is suspected to play a vital component in all people that experience symptoms of psychosis  We now know that the drug works quite well for Parkinson s Disease Psychosis  If 5 HT2A is an equally good therapeutic target in Alzheimer s Disease Psychosis and Schizophrenia  we may see some stellar results from upcoming clinical trial for pimavanserin in the treatment of those diseases as well   The  020 study  the phase III trial for pimavanserin in PDP that released data yesterday  is a precursor to another phase III trial that Acadia plans to conduct to further build pimavanserin s efficacy profile  which will be referred to as the   021 study   and an additional safety study that the company refers to as the   015 study   These studies will be performed to solidify the chances of an FDA approval when the time comes for pimavanserin s first NDA submission  Although this means that investors will have to wait longer for pimavanserin s potential FDA approval  additional phase III trials with statistically significant data significantly improve the drug s chances since they establish a more elaborate efficacy and or safety profile for a drug   With its recent jump  Acadia has reached a market capitalization of  307 million  The market should slowly change its perspective on Acadia due to the recent results which prove that the drug actually works too  It s no longer a matter of whether or not pimavanserin works or not  but a matter of how valuable the Parkinson s Disease Psychosis market is  There is also a lot of potential for schizophrenia  and even greater potential in Alzheimer s Disease Psychosis  of course  Acadia investors who are in for the long haul realize this  and will probably hold on in anticipation of a higher valuation of the company  Traders  on the other hand  have a lot of incentive to take their outsized profits from yesterday s trading in the pursuit of other biotech catalysts on the horizon  While ACAD stock could see some immediate downward pressure due to this  the intrinsic value that was added by pimavanserin s latest clinical trial data remains ,2012-11-29,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/acadia-rockets-into-the-stratosphere-on-clinical-trial-data-145407,145407
