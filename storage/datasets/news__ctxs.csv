So  good morning  everyone  and thanks so much for joining us today  Earlier this morning  we reported our 3Q fiscal  19 results  You can see those on our earnings numbers that are posted on our Investor Relations website and have been furnished with the SEC  Also  all of today s Analyst Day materials are currently posted on our Investor Relations site as well on the front page  Please scroll to the bottom  You ll see view all of the slides that will be presented here today 
We know it s a busy time right here in the heart of earnings season  So  we ve tried to keep the content tight  while also addressing a lot of the fundamental questions you all have been asking over the last year  This meeting has been  as you know  in the works for quite some time  But we re pleased this morning you ll be able to hear from our most seasoned executives as well as the newest members of our executive leadership team 
So following the presentations from David  PJ  Mark  and Arlen  we ll have everyone grab some lunch and that ll be set up in a buffet outside  come back  eat your lunch in here and we ll do a question and answer afterwards  And then we ll ask that you hold your questions until a mic gets to you so that we can hear it on the webcast 
As you would expect  we ll be making a number of forward looking comments  Let me switch to the forward looking statements where we inherently have risks and uncertainties  For this and more information on the reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP measures  please see the back of the presentation material that s on the website or with our most recently filed SEC documents  This event is being webcast and is available for replay 
And with that  I will turn it over to David Henshall  our President and CEO 
David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks  Traci  and good morning everybody  It s great to see a packed house here and also welcome to everybody that s joining us live on the web around the world  So  as Traci said  we re going to give a formal update on the business and talk a little bit more about really just the    about the operations  the products and the financial outcomes  not just of where we are right now  but a status on the transformation we ve been driving across this organization over the last couple of years and then how to think about the rate and pace over the next  really over the next    really over the next five years or so 
Also  give me a chance to introduce a couple of new members to the leadership team  Really excited to have these folks joining the team in their new roles  Right after me you ll hear from PJ Hough  PJ has been with us for about three years now  Some of you actually know PJ  PJ is our Chief Product Officer  who runs all products across the Company 
Mark Schmitz will come and talk about operations also with the organization for about three years now  but has stepped into a much broader capacity as our Chief Operating Officer  focused on really scaling people  product  systems  etc  that are going to be necessary for us to continue the transformation going forward and doing it in actually an accelerated pace from where we ve been over the last couple of years  And then  Arlen Shenkman  just recently joined as our Chief Financial Officer  also running Corporate Development and Strategic Alliances across the Board 
So  we ll dive into each one of those areas and try to keep this actually pretty tight and concise over the next hour and a half or so  And as Tracy said  we ll open it up to get into a more interactive dialogue across the topics that are covered today and also talk about Q3 where it makes sense 
So  it s pretty interesting and as you step back and you think about this Company  I mean  we just celebrated our 30th anniversary earlier this year  So  we ve been at this for a long period of time  Pictures of covers in annual reports over that period of time  what s fascinating is that we have really been focused on this fundamental value proposition of connecting people and information  doing that on demand and in a secure managed available way 
It s just been a real maniacal focus for us    for our customers around the globe  regardless of the shifts in the technology landscape and the types of pressures that all of our customers face across the Board  It s allowed us to really create and lead in some pretty important categories around virtualization  app delivery  VDI and how we re thinking about defining the broader workspace right now going into the future  All of our customers have really trusted us over the years to manage what s mission critical for their business  whether that s applications  business processes  information access  etc  and that s allowed us to continue to leverage this position of strength into where we are today 
So  let s focus to 2019 and I m really proud of the fact that we re now servicing customers in over 100 countries around the world  In fact  we have hundreds of thousands of independent customers  Within that number  I d say about 100 000 is what you d consider to be enterprise class organizations  Just about all of the Fortune 100 are Citrix s customers 
Probably an underappreciated asset that the company has is the fact that we have  ballpark 100 million people leveraging our technologies on a regular basis to access information  to drive their business forward  That means those tens of millions of clients that are out there on endpoint devices that are running Citrix today  Gives us a really unique Trojan horse to be able to deliver new technologies with a much lower level of friction and allowing people to consume that at the same time in a much easier way 
We ll finish this year somewhere around  3 billion in total revenue  You ve seen the shift in the P L  which Arlen s going to talk much more about  Obviously  subscription ARR  the best way to measure the progress of our transition has been on fire lately  It s approaching  700 million in total revenue  growing at 40   And that s just a clear reflection of what s going on across the financial side of the transformation of the business 
We ll exit this year with  ballpark about two thirds of new product bookings coming via subscriptions  means we re well over halfway through that part of the transition  So  all of these headwinds to growth that we have talked about for the next    well  really for the last couple of years are abating at this point in time allowing us to inflect and start driving up into the right  from a growth rate standpoint  And at the end of that  you ll see a much cleaner P L  faster growth  higher profitability  but much more predictable and easier for us to layer upon new incremental revenue streams from a customer point of view 
So  we had a lot of progress and it s interesting  This is actually my 67th quarter end with the company  And so I ve seen a lot of these transformations with the business and the one question I still get pretty constantly from investors is  I don t understand why Citrix is still growing  I thought apps were actually moving to the web  And so  if that s the case  what is the fundamental value proposition for Citrix  And so  thought I would just net it out  And you saw this if you looked at the slides earlier today  just netted out a really simple    all those financial terms for you  This is why we are growing  pretty simply  And we ll talk about each one of these throughout the course of the morning  we ll drill down into that 
But at the simplest level  we re addressing a much larger value prop than ever before  Customers have used us for virtualization historically  but as you look forward  it s really a broader story than that  focused on mobility  focused on analytics  focused on managing devices  and a whole host of other areas around productivity and engagement  So  it s a bigger opportunity  The customers that have been with us for a long time are spending more  We ve done a progressively better job all the time  which Mark will cover around cross selling products  So  consuming multiple independent point products at the same time  Penetration within those big customers is still growing  Virtualization is a growth market  It s growing  We created it  we lead it  and we re investing to maintain or even accelerate that lead going forward 
Despite the size of the customer base  we re adding thousands of new customers every year  about 3 500 year to date  So  we ll exit this year with probably 5 000 or so net new customers that we haven t worked with in the past  And then of course  as customers start consuming some of these new services  most of these will fall under the banner of Citrus Cloud  We re going to add a lot of incremental value to them  Value in a way that could be everything from optimizing that existing virtual ops in desktop infrastructure they might have as a legacy customer to net new services around mobility  around analytics  around endpoint management  a number of other areas that we ll talk about more 
So  at the end of the day  bigger opportunity  large and growing customer base  selling higher ASPs  That s pretty much the easy story  So  the second part of that is  well  if that s the case  who s actually buying  Simple answer is just about everybody  Largest companies in the world rely on Citrix  It s a critical part of their IT and security infrastructure  There s a lot of conversation that I ve heard over the years that assumes that we are just focused around financial services and healthcare which are important verticals  but they actually don t represent the majority of our overall business  The other verticals of course where security and compliance is absolutely critical to their business and therefore  our solutions are a perfect fit  And that continue to be going forward  Also the ways that we re able to really bring together the infrastructure that simplifies it for IT environments  So they can remove cost  so they can make it easier for people to consume information  so not just security and cost cutting 
Left hand side of the chart    actually we can skip over here  Talking about the types of challenges  this is probably an easier way to look at it because frankly this is a summary of most customer conversations that we ll have on a regular basis  Security compliance  as I said cost efficiency  those are all super important  Left hand side of this chart though represents what I guess people have probably described today as business transformation  It s an overused term that really encompasses a number of different areas  but it s focused on how do I get closer to my end user  How do I provide incremental services to my customers  How do I turn business agility from a project  Imagine just onboarding and offboarding users  offshore development  M A integration  These are projects  but they re becoming much more of a core critical competency for a lot of businesses because the cycles that we re in are moving faster and they have higher volatility than they have in the past  So  we no longer have the benefit of just thinking about these things as a one off  It needs to be fundamental for the way a lot of our customers operate  And the workspace really supports all of these in a pretty pronounced fundamental way 
So  we step back and then we think about our customers  Our largest customers are extremely loyal in the business  Our Top 10 customers as measured as those that generated the most total net bookings dollars in 2018  every one of them has been with us for over a decade at this point in time  And also  it s true for about 70  of the Top 100  So  our biggest customers are very sticky  They ve been with us for a long time  They re spending more money  Yet at the same time as I said a minute ago  we re continuing to add more and more to grow the base of that pyramid and allow those to become tomorrow s largest customers  And over that period of time  it has allowed us to really step back and deliver a very sustainable  very predictable growth from the business  up into the rye and this is the picture  looking at just the financial outcome since we re a public company roughly 25 years ago  In fact  this holds true regardless of the various economic cycles that we ve been in  the various changes in the technology landscape  Simple fact that  we just added value to a lot of customers and our products are sticky 
The only two times that we ve had a year that went down was due exclusively to a divestiture  Back in the 2001 2002 timeframe  we sold some products to Microsoft and of course those of you who have been close to the company recently  2017 when we divested the GetGo business to really focus maniacally on the broader Citrix Workspace strategy  So  that s how we thought about delivering the business over the last many years 
And I d say  in the last two years  I would describe the company is focused on three big motions  three big transformations  These are the ones that I guess will usually be covered by PJ  Mark and by Arlen going forward  But the idea is moving from products to platform  Let me just give you a background and context  So about three years ago  we were organized across a number of different business units  product leaders  etc  and we re building products  which is great to drive incremental focus on those areas  but it s really hard to drive more of a horizontal approach  a suite  a bundle  a platform  And so  we reorganized the Company 
We brought in PJ to run products wall to wall across the organization  We went from a product stand alone to an integrated single business  And the outcome of that is we re able to operate with a much  much higher level of innovation than we ever have  Our rate of new patent filings is triple what it was at that period of time  At the same time  we re pushing out faster new product introductions at a much higher product quality index  So  very happy with the progress there 
On prem to cloud is really about meeting customers along that hybrid cloud journey  We ll talk about and what most people realize is that the pace of change inside of our customers is actually pretty slow  And this is really where the services inside of Citrus Cloud come together  Citrus Cloud today is a collection of roughly a dozen of services for those customers that are looking to move their existing infrastructure to the cloud  Those customers are looking to consume net new areas and even a set of solutions for those that just aren t ready to move yet  things that we can do to optimize your on premises deployments because everybody wants to move  it s just the practical realities of doing that are somewhat challenging for a lot of customers  And giving them the tools to do that on their pace  while migrating them onto the platform gradually is a core part of the strategy 
And then of course  over the last couple of years  really accelerating the perpetual to subscription motion  which Arlen will go into with a lot more depth  So  it s important I think to just spend a minute thinking about where customers are coming from and why all this matters so fundamentally to them  because in the industry  we talk a lot about these different areas of technology  We always talk about mainframe to client  server clients  serve to PC etc  And it was only about five years ago that just about every organization was entirely focused on that bottom era  I guess  we can call it the PC era  where data was on prem and data centers were on prem  core set of ERP systems  it really brought together  all of the transactional information in the business  Data repository was inside the corporate network  etc  That was about five years ago  and it s really only been about five years that we have started to move into what everybody in the industry talks about is the cloud mobile era  where now devices are truly ubiquitous and they re changing constantly all the time to be able to consume and pull information as well as sources of information that are feeding back into the infrastructure 
Services are now obviously third party  whether we re talking about just the latest SaaS services being acquired and deployed by the marketing department  as well as a replacement and disruption for a lot of the core systems that are out there  And then of course  infrastructure as it exists  in a public  private and hybrid mode  And all these things have created a tremendous amount of promise and opportunity  of course  but for most companies  they re still living down at the bottom  I mean  this is what a large majority of their infrastructure still looks like today and their pace to move forward is probably described more as glacial than anything else  It s just the realities of dealing with this 
So while at the same time  the promise of where we are is pretty pronounced and the complexity that this causes is also a big problem  This new area takes security and distributes it from the core corporate network out to the endpoint  Data security is now distributed  You re relying on your third party providers for services and all of these other things  Your attack surface is dramatically different than it was just a few years ago  And so  the industry has created a lot of point products to help manage this fundamental set of problems  You see these apps come up all the time  productivity apps  things whether they re just new mail clients  business file  sync and share  others  And then of course  tools to help manage and search across all this sprawl 
It s a terrible stat that today people spend about one day a week looking for information  Entire day just trying to find the latest file  the email they were looking for because of all this distribution that s out there  Obviously  as people have moved outside of the office being able to understand who they are  what they have access to  what their rights are  created IM as a separate category  SSO is a way to abstract away some of that inherent complexity kind of put a skin on the top of it  so people can consume information with a little bit less overhead attached to it  With device for all of course comes the need to manage independent devices  So  a number of different strategies out there obviously to lock down the device itself  really  create a new corporate owned device  manage the information that s on it  create multiple profiles  all the things that have happened around endpoint management  of course  App delivery  we know it well  Obviously  it s created a way to help simplify some of these challenges from an IT standpoint  VDI is a great example that falls into this category as a way to bring all these disparate applications together in a way that IT can manage more effectively  can secure  can optimize  can deliver it and drive that forward 
Clearly  new threats across the security landscape  things that didn t exist a few years ago  but have really come up because of the availability of cloud services  the new work styles distribution  these are ever changing and creating a fair bit of complexity because of all the promise that has existed within this mobile and cloud area  Then of course  delivering applications  App delivery networks and all of the associated services here  It s only been within the last couple of years that networking was something that we ve fed kind of in and out of the data center in a traditional way  Today  as PJ will go through more than ever  you ve got a horizontal approach  We re connecting across data centers  across applications  across services and the need to manage and maintain all of that is incredibly challenging  and it just makes it that much harder for all of our customers 
And so  if you think about that customer that is living still a little bit in the PC or client server era  managing all of this incrementally has caused a lot of complexity and it s slowing them down that much more  This idea of promise of all the power of the cloud in a lot of ways just forces more focus internally  trying to manage all of the piece parts  that exists here is an increasing challenge and this isn t just about on boarding new technologies  but it s about the necessity to actually integrate them together  to hire people to maintain and manage these things and the ongoing challenges that come as they migrate at a different rate and pace going forward 
So  the reality though is that the typical customer in the Citrix Universe has over 500 applications  Over 500 applications in their infrastructure operating today  Some of the largest financial services firms  folks that are represented here live in person  the number is 20 times that  I ll meet with a lot of the IT organizations for your companies and we talk about the thousands and thousands and thousands of different apps that are out there  And they re across all kinds of different architectures  It s not just consuming net new SaaS apps or mobile apps  it s across the gamut  And the reality is that  most of these applications are still going to be here years and years into the future  They re just hard to replace 
Your IQ organization is spending on average about 90  of the budget maintaining what exists today  That just leaves a little small sliver to try and drive innovation  adopt net new  really move the business forward  The needs aren t going away  just the complexity is underneath all that  We work with customers  We had a customer conference just a few months ago  And so  whenever we re having the similar conversation  I always try to describe the data center  I use this archeological dig comparison and when we do that  the main point  the takeaway of that is  is that applications that you put in place years ago are still there  They re still in the infrastructure  They just get layered on top  So  all these great new applications you re adopting today  things that you think of as disruptive  are actually creating a lot more complexity in many cases  because they re layered on top of each other 
Great example  I was with the financial services company down the street about three weeks ago  We are going through what their new initiatives are  They re talking about business transformation and they toured me around  how they ve redone a lot of their real estate in an open seating plan and it s great  They re really trying to move forward  not only to drive their own business forward  but to actually attract and retain this new generation of employees  And as we finish the conversation  it segued into the fact that they still have mainframe applications that were built in the  60s that are running inside the data center  for a couple of reasons  One  there s nowhere to put that information  They don t know how to do the data migration in the first place  And it s not a huge priority  It s still operating providing a fundamental level of value to the company  And so  even though they want to adopt all this net new  they still struggle with that challenge of complexity that exists  It s a big  big problem  And when you put it together  all those piece parts that I showed you on that spidergram  the research shows it would cost a typical company about  1 000 per user per year  The promise of the cloud and all the cool stuff that comes with it  is actually pretty expensive  And of course that s just in addition to the cost that they already had of maintaining and running the existing business 
So that s back to that whole run grow equation that most IT organizations struggle with  Just too much money is spent maintaining the complexity that exists  not enough money to be able to simplify and move that forward  And so  that s the challenge from an IT standpoint  What PJ will talk more about is that there s a lot of challenges on the demographic side as well from the end user point of view  We ve got huge shifts happening across organizations and I am sure everybody sees in your own company right now that traditional work models have really just evaporated pretty recently  Less than half people are working inside of an office tethered to a machine  Everybody is a little different than they used to be  They have to approach almost every individual inside of a large enterprise today as a mobile worker  because they re working in different places  different devices  different work styles  And some companies are actually employing this as a    almost as a business strategy  I was at this customer conference  I was using eBay as an example  an example that they in sourced some of their support as a way to just drive efficiencies and cut cost 
And when they in sourced that  what they did was they leveraged Citrix s infrastructure to tap a part time stay at home work force  The group that would never be in the office in a traditional environment  they can now access in a way to cut cost  way to drive more efficiency and actually bring them back into the workforce where they might not have been able to do that in the past  That s about attracting and retaining people 
And I ll tell you what I meant  spending time with not just CIOs  but a lot of CEOs  the reality is that we ve got a global talent shortage right now  It s one of the reasons why unemployment is as low as it is  And when that happens  all that does is generate increasing costs at a pretty rapid basis and attrition keeps going up across the board  So we re looking for ways to just engage people more and more across the board  We fundamentally believe that enabling people to do their best work is a technology conversation  Its things that we can do to engage people better  giving them the tools to be productive on their terms  And a lot of that comes back to this idea of employee experience 
And we use this team pretty loosely and you re going to hear that over the course in the next couple of hours  We re not just talking about look and feel  but really fundamentally stepping back and understanding what are the things that people are trying to get done  What are the business processes that can be automated  What are the systems that we can bring together to abstract away a whole bunch of complexity for IT to allow them to go faster  allow them to cut costs  allow them to be more secure  That s a big part of what we re doing right now  because fundamentally  it s a conversation much more about productivity and engagement  PJ will go into this in detail  but this idea of unengaged or disengaged employees is really a global epidemic right now 
Gallup s done some work and they talk about this as a  7 trillion problem  because most of the people are just not working that hard  It s probably not fair to say working hard  it s probably more fair to say they just don t have the tools  the systems to be productive where they need to be  We re making it just harder than we have to  That s one of the things that you ll hear more about  how we think about it and what we re doing to help solve and fix this problem 
It bears out when you call up some of the actual statistics about this  People will tell you  I got the right tools  I m going to be very productive  I don t have the right tools  it s really going to hurt  More than half the people think that their tools are on the far right hand side of this chart 
Stats will show you  the research that people are doing all the time into this idea of productivity  it s going to point out the fact that most people in a typical office environment are productive less than 10 hours a week  In some cases  it s less than three hours  So  it s a pretty big problem right now and we re looking for ways to really drive that forward 
And so  part of what we re here to talk about today and for those of you that have followed the Company much more closely is that  we fundamentally believe there are opportunities to solve these problems  We think there s a better way  That s the real idea behind the Citrix Workspace  the things that we re doing as a company to really bring this together  And so  it started with this concept of this spidergram  where we ve got market leading capabilities in a number of these point products  And so we thought  there s an easy first step to start to aggregate this together  to allow a lot of our customers to pull out some of those point products and just consume the individual components that are part of the overall platform  I d say this is our first step  This is what we had talked about as organizing IT  So internally  we ll say  organizing IT is the first step  Bring these apps and these disparate pieces together  It s easier to manage  it s more secure  we can cut costs  we can drive that level of benefit for the typical IT organization 
Second phase  of course  is like  how do you organize work within that  And that s where the Citrix Workspace came together in its  really  it s current form couple of years ago where it s now focused on a single unified and secure way to manage all applications  whether those are virtualized apps  SaaS  mobile  native  you name it  Ways to connect into your information  your files  whether those reside in Citrus Cloud  Box  Dropbox or a number of on prem repositories  but getting that single way to access that  solving some of that problem of searching for information  of course  making this ubiquitous across different device types so that devices can be transient  move in and out 
We build security within a lot of this  whether that s just security as a way to access  to manage devices  to enforce policies  etc  And as we do that  we ve been able to collect an incredible amount of valuable information  Our analytics touches information that s happening across the network  the device  the app  the user and many other different attributes and not just capturing that in a way where we can turn it into a report  but use it in a way to really close the loop and drive actions and PJ will go into much more detail about that 
And then  of course  evolving our networking portfolio to really be focused on application delivery  application security and many of these things that really drive the workspace forward  So  that s where we were moving from organizing IT to organizing work  And then the last phase is what we ve announced this year  And this is much more about how do we use that level of intelligence to really guide and automate work going forward and transform the workspace into this fundamental platform that is really targeted toward how do you add value across all employees  regardless of whether you re power users  you need all the power of virtualization  or frankly whether you re just an employee that needs a couple of SaaS apps and Office 365  I need to add value across the entire spectrum for all applications  of course  and then using analytics in a more profound way to really drive a lot of those outcomes and actions and be much more predictive on ways that ll influence immediately the productivity of individuals  And  of course  built entirely on the cloud  so that we can allow customers to leverage the infrastructure that makes sense  allow much more flexibility in terms of scaling up and scaling down as they look forward and manage that dynamically 
And to understand where we re coming from  let me just take a second to talk about  I guess  you call it our world view  but the way we think about technology inherently  because it s different than a lot of our competitors  Do we    assume that people are in the middle  I mean  this is a little bit more about human based computing  Thinking about the empathy for  not just technology  but what are people actually trying to do  What are they trying to get done  How do we make them more productive and more engaged  And so  on the left it s    I guess that s representative of different devices and sources of information 
We believe that devices are going to continue to be ubiquitous  They re very  very transient  They re always going to be changing  And the scope of which you just can t try to lock down  This idea of locking down a device in a way that kind of recreates a corporate owned device is just going to create the opportunity for people to work around it  It adds more security problems  more complexity  There s got to be a more flexible approach to that  Frankly  the same thing holds true on the infrastructure on app side  the idea that these things are transient  Applications that are hot today may or may not be here five years from now  We see this transition on a regular basis  because we need to create that platform that allows people to consume new things as they come along  but also migrate into new areas in a much less frictional way going forward 
And of course  when it comes to the infrastructure and some of your other providers  the realization that your partners today you need that level of flexibility to continue to move and optimize where it makes more sense for your business  Because most of our customers are selecting Azure or GCP or AWS  they re utilizing services from all of the above  and they ll continue to do that for reasons that are important in their business  And those reasons may change over time and it s important to recognize that as we build up our platform from the ground up 
And so  just    to really summarize this and just put it in a very  very simple terms  we re adding value in a couple of different ways  This is    think about this as value for shareholders  revenue growth  profit etc  Over the years  we ve built a  3 billion business  largely based on virtualization  Unfortunate enough to attach networking is a form of virtualization or workspace delivery  but overall  we ve only been able to touch about 30  of the seats inside of our existing base 
Now  30  of the available seats within our current customer base are Citrix customers  That number is growing each and every year  And we re doing things to continue to increase the average revenue per seat by adding in new capabilities around the workspace platform intelligence  optimizing SaaS  mobile analytics etc  That s one vector of growth and we re seeing a lot of what s driving our resurgence in the last couple of years  really based probably on this single vector moving up and driving a higher usage for customers 
But the way to think about the platform as we describe it is much more about how we drive this wall to wall attach  really driving productivity across the board and that s creating that fundamental platform that I ve talked about  and you ll hear much more about that services the needs of all users  all application types really across any industry  We re focused on building a vertical platform that can much easier add incremental services on top of the seats that are existing today  That s where the less friction comes in and we can continue to segment users in a way that provides the most value for those individual customers  Whether those need    yesterday s virtualization solutions  whether those are consuming Citrix TAZ or Windows Virtual Desktops or partner solutions that help verticalize and drive this going forward  That s the inherent platform approach that we ve been driving  So  we re looking to add value across both of these axis  And that s where the strategy is right now and that s how you should think about it as you listen to the next couple of presentations because as we execute against this  this just allows us to grow our TAM pretty significantly 
As I mentioned today  internally we ll talk about virtualization as amazing technologies  but a bit of a specialized use case  targeted toward the most complex  the most secure  the most powerful solutions and as a category  not just Citrix  but everybody  that category touches about 20  of the available knowledge workers in the world  That number is slowly growing  As I ve said a couple of times  virtualization is a growth market and it continues to expand  but when we think about this  this is the simplest way to articulate the Workspace platform  It s like how do we not only grow the virtualization part of the pie  but obviously continue to expand around that entire circle  That s the untapped opportunity that we look at today 
And so  the categories we compete in as measured by Gartner  they re big  That s our traditional categories  virtual client computing  ADC  business file sync and share  et cetera  And whether these numbers are precise or directionally correct  the point is they re very big markets  they re growing and we ve got plenty of headroom to be able to expand into that  But as we start to go through some of these areas we ve been executing on over the last couple of years  you see this number continue to expand whether we re looking at more of a software defined perimeter  It s a fancy term for networking being disaggregated away from hardware into    moving more into software services and analytics  Bringing in capabilities to secure SaaS applications  more natively to connect people to cloud apps  It s the first click of the Workspace 
And then really where we are today  targeting areas around productivity and integration and things that were just not possible when we were focused purely on virtualization  it further expands that overall pie  And so  as we continue to execute forward  we re just going to expand our addressable market by as much as a factor of three from where we were just a couple of years ago  And that s were we re focused on driving forward and that s what you ll hear more about today 
These three big initiatives that have been really front and center across Citrix for the last couple of years  Products to platforms  which really extends our value in a number of different ways  the on prem to cloud journey  which will support our customers across this hybrid approach  which will be dominant for the next several years  and then  of course  expanding our business model in a way that provides leverage  growth and predictability going forward 
And then lastly  I mean  internally we talk about three primary business outcomes  These are the things that are inherent in a lot of our products right now with the focus on experience  experience for the end user and to a degree experience for the IT organization  Simplified complexity  make it easier to consume and that drives value productivity engagement  Choices about infrastructure  choice of device  choice of cloud providers and the recognition that those things will change over time  so it s critically important for us to maintain that  and then  of course  inherent security that is built into everything that we do right now  both from an individual security product standpoint and a secure architecture 
So thank you very much  That s my quick introduction  Now I want to call up PJ Hough  PJ will do a more deep dive into the ecosystem and the product technologies  Thanks  man 
PJ Hough    Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer
Thank you  David  Good morning  everybody  I d like to walk you through a little more detail on our product strategy and really position it in the context of what we see as the key trends in our industry  where the market forces are and what the big opportunities are for us  and thank you for our customers as we move through this transition 
As David indicated  one of the things that we certainly see our customers dealing with is the move to the cloud  And this has actually caused customers in many cases to reevaluate not just how they get to the cloud  but what they do in preparation for getting there  And we recognize that for many customers  it s going to be a long journey and that there are things that we can help them do that really honor the environment that they re going to be in which is hybrid and multi cloud and it recognizes the fact that they re going to maintain a significant footprint on prem even as they continue on their cloud journey 
A second key focus area for our customers today and one that comes up in every conversation that we have is around security  enterprise security  And how customers deal with the potential of the opportunity of the cloud of the potential of a mobile and flexible workforce and at the same time providing the governance and controls that they need to deliver their business securely  And then finally  one that has I think resonated deeply with us and a conversation that we are having with every customer who s undergoing some form of digital transformation is how they think about employee productivity 
The numbers that David shared are stark with regards to how employees today are viewing the tools that they have to help them do their job  but maybe more importantly in a tight labor market  everything that you can do to attract the right talent  to retain the talent and then help them be productive  actually it flows directly to the bottom line in organizations  And we ve seen market differences between organizations that have managed to capture that employee productivity and organizations that are not quite there 
So  I think the cloud journey provides a substrate against which we can talk about much of the transitions that are occurring in our industry  And it s not specifically just about the move to the cloud  It s about the mindset shift that happens in organizations when they go on that journey that causes them to reevaluate the things that they ve historically done  the constraints they ve applied to their business and the way they ve thought about how to operate their business and how the cloud has somewhat liberated thinking across a wide array of elements of their infrastructure 
If you think about the world that our customers now live in with regard to moving to cloud  they have a lot of choice  You look at the cloud platforms  you look at things like the hypervisors or how they think about building out their data center infrastructure  And for each one of these  as the customers move on that journey to the cloud  you should not think about it as a like for like  The cloud is actually enabling new scenarios  opening up new opportunities for customers to rethink how they engage with their employees  how they deliver services to customers  and how they operate their business 
A really good example of this is the work that we ve done recently in partnership with Microsoft  around Windows Virtual Desktop on the Azure cloud  And it highlights that as you think about moving to cloud  there are new ways to think about delivering Windows as a service  ways that we are familiar with and the ways that Microsoft has invested in  that really demonstrate that both of us are taking a different approach to thinking about how that might appear to an enterprise customer in the future  So why don t we just take a moment and watch a quick video of Brad Anderson describing that partnership and the relationship between Microsoft and Windows and Citrix 
 Video Presentation 
So  I think Brad hit on a number of really key elements in here that I want to highlight for you  The first is that both Citrix and Microsoft are partnering together to leverage the cloud to do new things and really  really reshape the way the customers consume our combined technologies  So  I think that deep technical engagement is obviously foundational to our partnership  The second thing that he talked about was our field engagement  and how we go to customers together in a way that actually brings the best of Citrix and the best of that Microsoft platform to the market  And I use that as a great example  because I think that nourishes the depth of our partnership  and collaboration that s occurring across the various aspects of our business  but also how that transformation is not just a replay of what we had in on prem software and solutions  The cloud is enabling us to really rethink ways to do that and it basically broaden the market for both of us 
So  I want to talk a little bit about the quality of experience that David mentioned  employee  mobility and I don t just mean mobile devices  I actually mean the mobile workforce  the distributed workforce and then finally enterprise security  When we talk to enterprise customers today  there are these challenges that they face  We re in an interesting time with regard to the trends related to IT and enterprise in the world  We ve actually hit a flat spot with regard to technology delivering productivity gains to organizations 
You can go back and map productivity improvements in organizations and output over the last several decades and you can map the key inflection points to the transitions to new technologies  Well  we ve sort of hit a flat spot  We ve now introduced a lot of new technology and we re not seeing a correlated growth in productivity  Something has actually flipped  A second key factor here is the shortage of talent  McKinsey estimates that in US  we re going to be short 95 million medium to high skilled employees next year  just in the US alone  And the C suite customer s that we ve talked to say that 61  of them believe that access to developer talent is going to be an impediment to growth for them and I use developer talent as a proxy for technical skilled workers as they sort of penetrate the workforce 
And then finally  we have this issue with low employee engagement  The Gallup number is startling  The number could be as high as 85  of the employees in organizations are disengaged  That means that    think about it  15  of your employees are fully engaged on helping you deliver your business  Well  and somehow we have to take a look at the IT systems that we ve put in place  because they do contribute  The third highest ranked factor by employees for why they stay at a company or why they leave after their salary and their manager is the tools that they have to do their job 
And when you think about the environments that we ve given to users over the years  it s not fair to say that that s where we are  We ve actually heavily invested  You look at these large new complex cloud based applications  you look at the deep investments that organizations have made  we re just not seeing the return  It seems like we ve substituted one set of issues for an equivalent set of challenges that users have as they move between old legacy applications and what I would even consider today  quite modern and SaaS applications inside the enterprise  At the same time and maybe this is at the heart of the challenge we face  in the consumer world  we ve all seen the technology evolve on a different path and in fact enable us to do things that are completely different 
Think about the apps that we have that are tailored to our personal experience that have a feed of information that comes to me  that matters to me  and that helps me understand what s going on  The number of apps that we now have in our personal lives that actually have notifications  that appear at the right time  that remind me to leave for the airport  to tell me to check in for my flight  that help me manage the stream of activities that I could possibly spend time on  but actually organize them in a way that helps me organize my personal life 
Think about the number of apps that now have a one click experience  book the hotel room  reserve the tickets  select my seat  Most of us don t have that for booking conference rooms or other resources within our organizations by contrast  And finally  we re now  in our personal lives  very used to interacting with services that actually are getting better the more we use them  They have recommendation engines  They help us find our next movie  our next book  our next album to download  and yet  at work we really struggle to provide those same tools to employees that help them guide themselves through their day at work 
And so  this is really where we re focused on building the Citrix Workspace  We really have thought about the problem in a very different way with regard to helping deliver that consumer like experience for our employees  across all of their devices  We think that s critical because  in fact we see more device diversity than ever before  We also see people working from multiple locations on multiple devices  So  how do you maintain context for an employee such that as they move from working on the train to their office  to working from home that they actually carry their work with them in a way that makes sense  We want to simplify access to all those applications through a very simple single sign on experience  So  that I don t really think about the fact that  I m switching apps or accessing multiple applications 
David highlighted the problems of search and finding the right information  We believe that there s a better way to deliver the right content to employees that help them find the things they need to do their job more easily  And at the same time  we recognize that we have to underpin all of this experience with a security and performance investment that really provides that context for work 
So  let me quickly show you what the key elements are in our Workspace experience  And by the way  this is a    screenshots of our product that we will be delivering before the end of this year and that next wave of product delivery  So the first thing you ll see highlighted in the intelligent experience is integration of assistance and search as a first class experience  We often know that people start their day by launching applications to look for work  but we also know that they often have a goal in mind  And how do you get that from goal to action as quickly as possible  How do you make it easy for them to express what they need to do 
The second thing that you ll see here highlighted and actually given  I would say  private place in the center of the workspace experience is this contextual personalized feed of work that I need to complete within the organization  It s a balanced mixture of things that are pushed to me that I have to complete and do as part of my job and a set of feeds that are pulled to me by me based on things that I m interested in understanding and knowing about the organization  And not only is this feed contextual  it s also actionable  Right here you ll see in blue the verbs where I can approve or process the work right here within the feed 
You ll also see that we ve elevated recommendations in the Workspace  We actually understand the types of actions that might be relevant for a particular employee  What s the next best thing I do at work  Think about that moment  while you re transitioning from completing a task to doing the next task  How do you choose what to do next 
Of course  people still need access to their applications and virtual applications  SaaS  mobile applications are all fully integrated in here into that Workspace experience  There will be times when you will want to go into a deep application as the starting point  but we also recognized that it s quite possible that you can accomplish many tasks based on the activities that are delivered to you in the feed  And finally  we have embedded micro applications into that Workspace experience that allows me to get the next level of detail inside the Workspace  so that I really understand what s going on 
Actually let s take a quick look at more interactive demo that shows exactly what s going on in the Workspace  Here you see that we ve really highlighted the apps  the content  the files  and if I m accessing a desktop that I have access to that here inside the Workspace  Remember  this experience works across all devices  But really our goal is to drive up engagement and productivity  not just have the Workspace to be a place that launches applications  but a place that I go during my day to actually get work done where I am presented with the actions that make sense for me  where I can get to see the information that s coming from the systems of record in my organization  but that s in a much more simplified and consumable way  Think about this particular example of an expense report coming from a large ERP expense management system  Typically today  you get the email that drives you into that application or you have to search for the right context in user interface  We re able to extract that in these micro applications and make it easier for you to complete that task in a much easier way 
There s also information that often needs to be shared with employees about new employees  new training courses  etc  We believe we can deliver a bunch of that  And then finally actions in here where I can not only consume information  but I can interact with those systems of record  In this case  creating an incident that s going to go back into our complex system of record  And if you wanted to know what that complex system of record looks like  this is an example  This is what the IT person in ServiceNow deals with when they received that incident that allows them to process it  So this doesn t replace systems of record for deep use  but for the casual user  the person who just needs to create the incident or who just wants to approve the expense report  we believe we can mine and extract those interesting workflows out of those applications and deliver them as consumer like experiences inside the Workspace 
Of course  delivering that same experience on mobile is critical to this plan  When I think about my own day and move in between meetings that s often my opportunity to understand what s most pressing  what needs my attention and allowing on a mobile device for me to easily observe this type of information and move quickly between my tasks and move the workflow of the company forward  I think that s really crucial 
Here you see that we ve integrated a digital assistant into the Workspace that can answer questions that we all struggle with  You know  what s my vacation balance  How do I easily get access to training  What courses are available  And over time  this will become more refined based on usage 
As David indicated  our world view is very much about putting the user at the center of the complexity and addressing the problem from the perspective of the individual user  And really when you think about that Workspace  think about it as a tailored experience that adapts to my usage over time much in the same way that we have social platforms and social tools that adapt to our usage  And so over time  my Workspace and David s Workspace will be quite different based on our usage  our patterns of activity and what matters to us in our roles  And the way we ve encapsulated that is by in fact putting that Workspace that personalized Workspace at the center of that overall experience 
Now what I ve shown you looks a lot like an application  But in fact  the way that we have decided to build this is to build it as a platform  We recognized that as a platform we have the opportunity to build the next layer of tools that apply to all users inside organizations and that can be integrated into all of the applications and workflows that matter to them  And what you see here on the slide are a list of some of the other applications that we expect that will be integrated into this platform over time  They re just indicative of the fact that many organizations have many of these tools and need to provide a coherent and consistent experience that sits on top of all of them 
So what does this mean from a business perspective  Well  I think the first thing it means is  you will see us accelerate the Workspace adoption across a wider set of users inside the organization  The workflows that I showed you and that simplified experience are not constrained by the 30  of VDI use cases inside the organization  They are generally applicable to all employees 
And one  Phonetic  could argue that our biggest opportunity with Workspace in that context is to actually address some of these broad corporatewide workflows whether it s employee on boarding or improving your interview process  or simplifying the way that you manage performance or other capabilities that could be delivered to basically every employee inside the organization  And so therefore  we see potential    significant potential for seize expansion inside our existing customers as well as attracting net new customers that recognize this as a brand new opportunity for them to think about the Workspace that they deliver as the platform for work inside their organization 
Except from a product perspective  when I think about the waves of adoption that we re going to see  the first wave is the one that we re experiencing right now and the one that s showing up in our financials which is that move to SaaS  the move to subscription and obviously  we re partway through that and it s well  well under way 
The second wave is I anticipate  we will start to see customers broaden the use cases for the Workspace inside their organization and thinking more wall to wall about the usage and the benefits that they could get from Workspace  And of course this opens up huge opportunities for us to take that platform that we re building and integrate it to deliver that complete experience for the widest set of users 
And third  is we re really opening up that platform and leveraging how we think about the kinds of solutions that not only we build  but that enterprises and third parties can also build on that platform  Recently about a month ago we held our first ever Citrix Developer Conference  where we invited 100 developers to come to our campus in Santa Clara and sit with the Workspace platform and our core engineering team  You read about it in our investor letter  It was a very successful event and I think it pertains a whole new direction for the company with regard to engagements with a new set of partners who take this platform and take it deep into organizations where they as partners understand the workflows and business processes and what really matters in vertical industries and in other geographies  So really that s the    that I think is the waves of adoption and the waves of potential growth that we see for Workspace in the coming years  a very exciting time for us 
I d like to switch gears now and talk about our Networking portfolio  And what we see happening in Networking which is actually a very exciting time  It s very clear that the Networking industry as a whole is moving from hardware and appliance to software  This is partly driven and accelerated by the move to cloud where frankly you don t get to deploy hardware  but you do get to put software services on top of cloud platforms 
Our investments over many decades in networking have all been software based  even though we have delivered them as hardware appliances  our core intellectual property and investment has always been in software  And  therefore  this is a trend that we can participate in as customers move from an appliance on prem based view of their network to a cloud and hybrid view of their network 
We ve  of course  have optimized the Workspace to run on our networking stack and we have optimized our networking tools to deliver the best value  the most optimal performance and the most visibility and control of that Workspace experience  And we also see customers on the networking business transitioning also to a subscription model  You see this show up in the context of pooled licensing for our networking business 
So let s talk a minute about the technology shifts that are occurring and how they actually play to some of the strengths that we have with the assets we own in networking  The first shift that we see happening is these large centralized applications when they move to cloud in many cases they re getting reengineered  They re getting redesigned to take advantage of cloud  Again this is another great example of how the transition to cloud is not moving from a static platform to an equivalent platform  Customers are using this as an opportunity to transform their applications that they build and leverage new capabilities that exist only in those cloud platforms 
I m going to give a quick example here that I think we ll all be very familiar with  The example is a very simple one of taking a photo and uploading it to a cloud service  When you take that photo today  what really happens is it gets uploaded to the cloud service and we generally think  oh  it gets uploaded and it gets stored in the cloud  The reality there are new services that are getting built that process that photo in the cloud  An example is geotagging  so it s that I can come back later and search for photos of Paris or New York and find the photos that I want  Or maybe the photos are getting facially recognized  so that I can come back later and search for pictures of PJ and you ll find pictures that are all relevant 
These are independent services  They re all part of this much larger application that s being built in the cloud  And the way that the app is being constructed is not as a monolith  it s actually being constructed as a set of these micro services  these little applications  And what that really means is if you think about the traffic from a networking perspective  the traffic is no longer just flowing from my mobile device to the cloud  it s between all of these micro services inside the cloud  And so this new networking paradigm has actually not just permeated the edge of the cloud  it s penetrated the architecture of how applications are getting built 
And so when you think about an existing application that ran in a data center on prem and now think about the places that people are building and running applications in the cloud  what you see is that that software element of networking now participates in many of these new environments  And this is the same technology  This is the same core Citrix ADC code base  the same core Citrix SD WAN code base and that marks at the top is really where much of the magic is happening in cloud networking 
It is the fact that you now require a common way to orchestrate  have visibility and have control over not just the applications that are running in your data center  but also the applications that are running in cloud  And our customers  as they move to pooled licensing  have the flexibility to now take those applications on prem  we factor them as they move to cloud and leverage that same subscription to Citrix Networking as they move the applications forward  The policies that they enforce  the orchestration tool that they use to manage it  the visibility and control and security that they had from our networking products on prem  all mapped directly into this architecture in the cloud 
And to the extent that you subscribe to the model that we do  which is on prem stays for a long time while customers move to one or more clouds  this model is going to be an enduring model for customers who consume Citrix Networking  So in the same way that we saw the phased transitions occurring in Workspace  we see similar phases of adoption occurring with Citrix Networking  That first phase is really about customers moving to our subscription and moving to hybrid and multi cloud  The second phase is really about rewriting those applications in a dramatic way  taking advantage of the cloud platforms and building these cloud native applications  I should comment that one of the things that has happened with the cloud native model  which is characterized by containers and technologies like Kubernetes is that those technologies have in fact in some cases flown back into the enterprise and back into on prem 
So cloud native networking is not just applications running in cloud  its applications written to the pattern that s been popularized by the cloud  And so again  we see even applications on prem getting modernized using the same set of techniques and the investments that we ve made are equally applicable to those on prem applications as they are to the cloud applications 
And finally  we see the emergence of this new orchestration capability for clouds and for networks  which is that ADC gets delivered as a service  And that means that I have an intent based way of describing how I want my applications to perform and the orchestration of these highly sophisticated networking deployments of maybe tens or dozens or hundreds of instances of network  all can be orchestrated in a consistent way across my cloud  across my multiple clouds and my on prem deployment  So that s a snapshot of where we see the transition occurring in our networking business 
Third  I d like to talk a little bit about analytics and our investment in this area  Clearly this is a very exciting investment for us and one that underpins both the core of our workspace strategy and the core of our networking strategy moving forward  There ve been several significant changes that have occurred in the capabilities of platforms over the last several years that really make the potential of a new analytics platform come to life for us  The first one is there is now a rich set of cloud enabled AI and machine learning platforms that are available  And they really have changed the game with respect to the platform on which you can build AI and machine learning enabled analytics and applications 
The second thing is  as our users have become even more connected  we actually have a deep understanding of the work graph  We know what device you use  we know what network you connect to  we understand what applications we use  we see the content that you share  we understand where you re based  we understand the patterns of work  And the more we understand about the people you interact with and the nature of work and combine all of that into an analytics platform  it gives us the ability to offer enhancements to the environment on top of it 
And the final one is that we really do understand that context of work  When you think about the Workspace and offspringing context into the Workspace  this really allows us to service new experiences for users that are powered by analytics in the background  I want to give you a few examples of some of the    I ll call them the services or applications that we are building on this rich  rich platform  So  on the left  what you see is the access to telemetry that we have that comes from our core products  And this is telemetry that we ve been compiling and building up for many years  whether it s the 100 million end points or the billions of data points we get from our traffic management solution or the petabytes of data that we see flow through our networking products on a regular basis  We have an incredible visibility across the users  devices  content apps and the network to understand what s going on  We have actually combined all of that into a common analytics platform and we re now building solutions on top of it that address specific problems 
The first one is how do we leverage that to make the environment more secure  Well  it turns out that user behavior analytics is    pivots around the idea of understanding what s normal behavior for users and being able to recognize anomalies and deal with them  And so  what we have is actually built a system that not only recognizes when an user is doing something anomalous  but we actually have the points of control in the Workspace and in the network to intervene on the device  We can ask for a second factor of authentication  We can restrict access in some way  We can turn on recordings  so that we keep better track of what s going on  So  in the context of security  we were able to deliver a much more comprehensive picture back to IT because of the deeper understanding we have of the individuals in the organization 
Next  I ll talk about performance  I mean  this has often been a challenge for our customers to understand in a physical deployed environment  what s the performance like for an individual user  Is everyone getting the same performance  Are people legitimately complaining about something that s changed in the environment or not  And how do you alarm IT with the tools that help them understand that  Well  take that problem and multiply it tenfold by distributing the users  distributing the applications  allowing people to bring their own devices and now try to get the same experience on top of that capability  And so we ve really designed the performance analytic solution to address that incredibly wide and diverse set of infrastructure  application experience and give the IT organization a consistent and clear view of what they are actually delivering to their employees as an experience 
When you think about employee engagement and retaining your best employees  not only you have to give them great tools  they have to work  They have to work all the time  They have to work when I m in an airport  They have to work when I m trying to get work done from home  when I m trying to get access to content  when I m on the road or presenting to a customer  And so how do you understand whether or not as an IT organization  your investments are actually delivering that correct set of capabilities 
And finally  I want to talk for a moment about productivity analytics  because this is the promise of taking all of this capability and insight and using it not just to drive what I would call optimization from an IT point of view  but to really drive productivity for end users and use this to feed insights to individuals that actually help them do a better job with working with the tools that are available 
We ve already delivered security analytics and it s been adopted by many of our customers  We are on the cusp of delivering our performance analytics  And what you should expect to see is that productivity analytics is one of these investments that I think has a much longer tail in some ways  because we ve just opened up a whole new way for thinking about how to leverage that analytics platform to deliver new capabilities to end users  And the more we engage with users inside the Workspace and the more we understand about what they re doing  the more you ll see us invest in creating capability that delights users inside that Workspace 
So really on the left  you ll see the capabilities that we re delivering from the analytics platform that are targeted at IT  But on the right  I think the long term objective here is to really unlock the potential of that analytics platform to really deliver new capabilities to individual users  How do I recommend the next best thing you work on  How do I anticipate the content that might be relevant to a project that you ve been assigned to work on  so that I promote that content and make it more easily accessible to you  How do we suggest things that you might want to go look at people in the organization you might need to get in touch with  How do we begin to understand the opportunity for automation 
I met with an enterprise customer last week who told me that 98 5  of all expense reports get approved in the organization  Yet every expense report gets multi layered  multi leveled approvals that go all the way up and down through the organization  Isn t the time that we thought about sort of reimagining how to make an approval process  Help us identify the anomalies  Not bog us down with the busy work of approval  How do you separate those things and sort of modernize the way that we think about that  One of those activities like approvals can we automate and still provide the same level of governance and control and visibility to organizations 
We will understand more about how people use the framework and the applications we ve built  We ll know which micro apps are the popular ones  We ll know where to invest more  We ll be able to guide IT to tell them  there s a set of activities that your users are working on that may not be as optimal as you could have them  We can guide ways to even guide the IT to help improve this overall experience 
So I think this gives you a sense of the relevance and importance of this very powerful analytics platform in the way that we are thinking about delivering not just new value to IT  but also really game changing experiences inside the Workspace that move very much away from application launch and much more to a guided work experience platform for guided work 
Before concluding  I wanted to talk a little bit about ecosystems and our role in the ecosystems that exist in the IT landscape today  We started out by talking    by hearing from Brad talk about our relationship to Microsoft  And in fact it s a very comprehensive picture of our participation in that overall Microsoft ecosystem  whether it s running our workloads on Azure  building together capabilities of Citrix Cloud integrations with Windows Virtual Desktop  our integration with OneDrive  the Office applications integrated into our Workspace experience or in fact our shared investments in device management  an end to end comprehensive picture of our sort of relationship and engagement model with Microsoft 
It turns out though that we have other ecosystems  where that picture is just as comprehensive  And in fact with Google  we have the same relationship on Google Cloud  their G drive integration  their Google apps  and in fact that same device management posture for the devices in their environment  If only life were simpler enough for our customers that they could choose one of these ecosystems and run their business  the reality is that most of our customers for a variety of reasons end up choosing both of those ecosystems and then having to deal with the places where they re not identical  It just not bodes through ecosystems  it turns out that there are other key ecosystems that we see in the landscape here that make this world a little more complex for users  and in fact prevent them from picking a single vendor strategy that meets the needs of all of their users  And ultimately  I think this is where the power of the investments that we re making at Citrix in our Workspace and in our underpinning networking really provide that integration platform for all of these ecosystems and applications that exist in your landscape 
Take a moment to look at this slide and look at the applications that are on this  and try to determine how many of them would have been on this slide five years ago  Or how many of them will be on this slide in five years  time or will have been replaced by something else  The application landscape is one of the most dynamic inside an enterprise organization  And having a partner that understands how to absorb new applications into the platform  deliver them in a consistent way with the existing applications you have  marry the mainframe from the 60s to the modern SaaS applications that you ve just consumed  deliver that in a consistent experience across all devices  across all your networks for all your users that really is the mission and vision of Citrix and the Citrix Workspace 
So when I think about bringing together all of our technologies  clearly the Workspace is the prominent user experience that everybody sees  And that really is the embodiment of the strategy of the company  It is underpinned in a very critical way by our investments in networking that really help provide the security  the performance  the visibility  and frankly  the confidence that IT needs to deliver that great Workspace experience 
And then the insight that we get from analytics drives not only the IT experience to evolve and deliver that in a better way  but over time it will also drive the user experience inside the Workspace leveraging our visibility and understanding of the vast set of information and data that we have in our customer deployments 
So with that  I want to thank you and I would like to invite to stage our Chief Operating Officer  Mark Schmitz 
Mark J  Schmitz    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer
Thank you  So good almost afternoon everybody  I d just like to give you a little bit of context for the role that I m playing  As David mentioned  I ve been with Citrix now for about three years and in this extended capacity for just a couple of months  I think there s a few items around my background that makes this fairly relevant to what it is that we re doing as a company in order to build on what PJ and Dave have already gone through 
So I ve started in the early 2000 with Ariba  and I was fortunate to go through several of the transformations that helped build that company into what it ultimately became  The first was around extending from a single product into a suite of applications and the solutions for our customers to consume  The second  obviously had to do with the movement of those from an on premise business and a perpetual model into the subscription business that ultimately led to the acquisition of Ariba by SAP 
In SAP  I had the good fortune of also spending a little bit of time helping drive the operation for building the subscription business into what was a very healthy and long standing perpetual business  So  helping SAP through that motion of expanding their customers who were very heavily perpetual and maintenance based into consuming and driving subscription services 
So today  I want to talk a lot about that  How we re actually transforming the Citrix business to help our customers realize the value that PJ just described  What are we doing internally to help build the cadence in operational performance to ensure that we re ready for our customers to move to the cloud  So  I ll talk about a few of our key internal focus areas  the opportunity for our customer base  I think David mentioned  we have an extremely loyal and powerful customer base  We need to extend that customer base to bring them into these new capabilities  so they can obviously grow with us as we expand 
I want to talk a little bit about the benefits that our customers are receiving as well as the expansion opportunity for us as a business  So  to focus a little bit on what it is that we re focused on as a company  number one is our go to market  This transformation started back in 2017 and we stand now today with internal processes in the sales force that has been enabled  trained and understands what it is we need to do to deliver subscription to our customers  Now  the sales force is only one element of our go to market motion 
The second is around our channel  Our channel has also had to grow from their previous reseller type relationships into one of our ecosystems such that our channel partners are not only helping us position these solutions with our customers  but also helping our customers extend those capabilities and continue to drive them forward  So  we spent a lot of time making sure that both the channel and our sales force are working together  And as we focus on what s next for the channel  there s only two strategic areas in 2020 that we want to make sure it s firing on all cylinders  The first is about our systems  integrators 
The SIs have a tremendous opportunity through this platform of digital transformation to work with our customers  to take their applications  to take their infrastructure  and begin to move and migrate it to the Citrix Cloud  Once that s done  the work is not over  They have a tremendous opportunity to continue to grow all that application landscape and move those to the cloud  while using Citrix as the front end to really simplify the experience for those customers 
Our platinum providers as well our platinum partners are specialists in Citrix  They have long standing relationships with our customer base and we believe they ll be able to make a significant improvement in helping us take what has not traditionally been our focus to date  which is the installed base migration to the cloud  we ve really been focused on selling new licenses to our existing customers and new customers as well  but really helping pull that installed base over into the Citrix Cloud and subscription world 
And next is around customer success  As we move forward in our subscription transformation  we know that customers are no longer making one time buys and going off in their devices to run  We re playing an integral part and actually running and executing those platforms on their behalf  In order for us to form a more strategic relationship with those customers  which is actually very important to emotion around expanding as that customer grows  we do invest in resources that are helping customers understand the change from just virtualization they ve been doing for a long time to many of these expanded services that I think David and PJ have both touched on  So we re making a significant investment to really get in front of our customers  understand what they re doing  understand the value that they need to do in order to get the employees engaged  to get the solutions adopted and continue to grow their Citrix footprint 
And then lastly  a key area of our focus is around pricing  We want to make sure that we re selling customers  what it is they need and leaving on a table room for incremental expansion  We want to sell them a platform  We want them to use and adopt that platform and as we see additional use cases that can help that customer grow  we want to make sure they re selling them that incremental capability as an add on service  such as our overall footprint can begin to grow quarter after quarter after quarter 
Moving on  I want to talk a little bit about what David mentioned earlier  which is our installed base  As you can see from this slide  we really are very diverse in terms of where our customers sit  This has a couple of pretty positive advantages  The first  really isolate some of the risk in any of these sectors having interesting economic event  it allows us to really broaden be quite diverse in terms of the used cases that we see with our customers who are driving this technology into execution 
Our teams were able to look at each one of the customers that operate in these different sectors and actually build on those use cases  and through that customer success vehicle really go out and help customers adopt new use cases  When customers adopt new use cases  we see seat expansion  because we know that we can touch incremental users within the installed base 
If we look at another view of our customer base  we can see that seat penetration is averaging about 30   That s a tremendous opportunity for us to go into our customers who are already getting lots of benefits primarily from our virtualization services and extending well beyond virtualization  So our virtualization is excellent because it continues to grow  It s a growing market  Citrix has the ability and we re actually growing beyond what the market is doing today  We have the ability to add these incremental services on to that virtualization base and continue to grow those seats 
Now in areas where we re even more heavily penetrated areas like healthcare  we still have plenty of opportunities  So a 50  penetration  we can still do lots of things  And a customer example here that I was involved in just a quarter ago was Springfield Clinics  They have been using electronic medical records to virtualize those and their physicians were using them  They had a CIO move out and their CIO    or their CEO was looking to create a digital platform transformation and they relied on Citrix to do it 
So not only did we expand the Workspace  give the customer much more capability than they had prior  we re actually able to extend that to every single employee within Springfield Clinics and go wall to wall  bringing the capabilities of Workspace for even those users that didn t necessarily rely on virtualization 
In terms of increasing our average transaction size  these seat expansion cases are doing exactly that  So as we go into customers and sell the power of the workspace  we re seeing those customers actually expand the users that are now leveraging the Citrix platform  This is driving a 20  increase in average deal size from what we ve seen over 2016 
Workspace is helping drive this expansion and the added products around analytics  files  mobility provides easy growth opportunities for us on top of the growth platform  Traditional users also are gaining significant benefits  Those users who may have been using virtualized apps or desktops are constantly beginning incremental capability from the product organization that is increasing the value of the applications that they re using  And this has afforded us not only the opportunity to increase the average transaction size  but also in our largest transactions we ve seen 30  growth in million dollar transactions 
Now the chart that you re looking at now is actually done in average contracts  our average annual contract dollars meaning that we re selling three and five year transactions and as Arlen will explain a little bit later this is having a significant positive benefit in our unbilled bookings that you see    that you don t necessarily only focus on when you look at our total growth 
Now customers wouldn t be doing all of these things  if there wasn t significant value in it for them  And it s not the value that we just market or that we just show on slides  customers actually have to realize this  And if you look at the move from on premise into the cloud  we re delivering on the first thing  which is to lower the total cost of running their Citrix environments  So by moving from an on premise environment into the cloud  we re seeing over 70  reduction in cost 
The employee experience we ve heard so much about today  those employees that are actually making choices on where they re going to work we re seeing an 88  improvement in their engagements  driving productivity even higher  And I think David mentioned that there is over 500 applications that many of our customers are actually using and have available to their customers  and roughly 34 of those applications are being touched by any individual user  There is a significant loss of time in figuring out which application you use and win  The Workspace is helping deliver those applications to the employee at the right time  helping increase the overall productivity and obviously driving a significant positive return for those customers who are moving to Citrix Cloud 
But I d like to just share one customer story here from EBSCO that may put this into a little bit more context 
 Video Presentation  So one of the really interesting things about this particular customer story is they share something that many of our customers we know are going through  that is a very complex multi hybrid cloud universe by which they are using multiple cloud providers to actually run and digitize their business  but they re using Citrix now to place that in front of them  And what I d like to show now is really the bookings profile from this customer  So  they ve been a longtime customer  very good and loyal customer  You can see that they made consistent purchases over the last 10 years 
Workspace helped us engage with this customer on a more strategic level  This allowed us to make a massive transaction that will actually partner with EBSCO to help them over the course of their future  And this one time transaction doesn t necessarily mean this is the end of their subscription growth  They have not bought everything  So if we go back into seat penetration  we have the opportunity to continue to grow  They mentioned that they were a conglomerate of over 40 companies as they acquire additional companies  it allows us to go sell those incremental users 
At the same time  we ve simplified their ability to deliver applications to everyone of these companies by using Citrix Workspace  Now this is a bookings chart  but the most important thing to also understand here is that we ve doubled the revenue on an annualized basis that this customer will deliver us    to us versus the business as usual when they re merely buying as a tactical provider  And this expansion motion is really at the key to our subscription business 
You can see there s a little bit of curvature to the blue line  which represents new landed accounts  This is primarily driven by our seasonality  But  on the green line  which represents the expansion  you ll see that it begins to be very smooth up into the right  But this is because as we land a customer account and we re able to display and deploy the capabilities  there s very rapid adoption of the solution  As this solution gets adopted  we continue to see customers expand on an as needed basis  not necessarily driven by the original seasonality  And this expansion is a true indicator of the health of our customers that are actually driving within our Citrix Cloud  And expansion is also driving multi product solutions 
So  as we go out and drive into our customers  again they don t necessarily own all of our 12 services that are in our Cloud  If they are a customer  who is only a virtualization customer  we re able to carve out the capabilities that they need and sell those incremental capabilities to their users through the Citrix Cloud platform  This is really leading the way to allow us to go into a multi product solution for each one of those customers 
A great example here is Safelite  Safelite is a company that actually fixes broken windshields in automobiles  They have a tremendously large call center  whereby people are calling to get their windshields replaced  They then deploy a car out to the actual site  so they can fix their windshield on site  Prior to Citrix  their call center did in fact run on Citrix  But with Workspace  we re able to create the mobile experience for those vehicles that have been gone out and done the work to replace the windshield and bring everyone together into a single environment 
We then extended actually further with Safelite back into their insurance transaction processing group  which allowed them to then take the windshield that had been replaced  and go further and extend the benefits to their insurance company  So  to further expand on this  let s look at one more customer example that shows what a deep relationship can do for us to expand that solution and user community 
 Video Presentation  So  I think this story represents a couple of really great use cases that put Citrix Workspace at the forefront of what we re capable of delivering  They talked about mergers and acquisitions and using Citrix really as the front end to simplify the end user experience for either company that is part of Worldpay  such that the end user s experience is relatively simple while the back end IT organization maybe relatively complicated as they figure out how to merge and integrate those systems together 
The second is this story really articulates how there s significant value beyond just virtualization and that the Workspace itself engages the employees and gives them a significant benefit when they come to work each day  They re truly using this to transform the way that they operate and ensure that their user experience is successful 
Now similar to EBSCO  you ll notice that the bookings opportunity for this customer was relatively flat over the first three years of our experience  Upon delivering the Workspace solution to them  we were able to sell them a much larger commitment over a three year period  And again  in this particular case  we ve driven the recognized revenue on an annualized basis well over 200  from where it was in the prior year  And these cases really show a very strong ongoing relationship with our customer and that s leading us to improve renewal rates as a company overall  So  we ve spent a lot of time making sure that with our customers that are going to stay on premise that we re providing them significant value 
So  we ve done a couple of things  We ve not only provided increased services with our standard support  but we re also building premium support options that range between 10  and 25  more on an annualized basis to give customers the same hands on strategic relationship and experience that we re providing for our cloud customers  And over time  we ll begin to see the installed base reduce  As we accelerate our transition motion  which has not necessarily been the primary motion for our sales force and we actually go target existing customers begin to move them to our Citrix Cloud  we should see an acceleration that will decrease the number of total users in the on premises world  but obviously increase in our cloud environments  As we do that  I need to double down on what we re doing from a customer success perspective 
I mentioned this earlier that the key is actually enabling our customers to move to the cloud  Once they do that  we are spending a significant amount of time with those customers to ensure that they actively adopt the solution  Active adoption means that we not only secure that customer for the long term  but we also see a significant opportunity to continue to sell them incremental value based services and expand the overall seat licenses that they re using  such that from a renewal perspective  we actually end up not in a transaction event at the end of their contract  but instead in a discussion about how they will accelerate and expand their current user community 
So with that  I d like to invite Arlen Shenkman  our CFO  to come to finish the story 
Arlen Shenkman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you  For those of you who I haven t met  I m Arlen Shenkman  I was with SAP for 15 years  I spent time as the CFO of North America as well as running corporate development and global partnerships  I was responsible for driving the inorganic parts of SAP s cloud transition  which included ensuring we had the right partnerships  relationships and investments in place to scale the business  When I was the CFO of North America  we were able to double our cloud revenue to over  2 billion 
I m excited to be joining Citrix at this stage in its journey to the cloud  As you heard from us today  we re focused on execution  We have work to do and like any transition to the cloud  there are always going to be periods that are marked by changes to our business model and changes to our financial performance  But that said  as many of you know  what emerges from the other side is often a faster growing and ultimately more profitable company and one that adds significantly more value in its sustainable business 
So why don t we flip to the third quarter  As you know  we released our numbers this morning  The headline numbers were strong relative to our guidance and consensus for revenue  margins and earnings  both subscription and SaaS revenue accelerated to 43  year over year growth  And importantly  we continued to see strong growth in our ARR with subscription up 40  and SaaS up 52   We believe ARR is a key metric for measuring our transition and I ll talk about this more as we go  We did see a slight tick downward in our total subscription mix of product  This was entirely attributable to the improvement in our SSP business  Overall  we re pleased with our third quarter results 
I want to remind you that Citrix has come a long way  The business has been executing on a significant transition for the past three years  Our mix of subscription  as a percentage of total product bookings  is 58  this year  which is more than four times where we were three years ago  Workspace is shifting even faster  hitting a 75  mix in the third quarter  Subscription is now more than 20  of our total revenue and we are seeing significant growth in ARR as I mentioned  As a result of the changes in the business model over the last three years  we re at a point where we see 2020 as a year in which we accelerate our revenue growth and hit an inflection point in our business transition 
As we progress through the subscription transition  we know it s important to show you where we see the arc of the transition and how this transition will impact our financials  I want to highlight you where we are today and where you can expect us to continue going  We expect 2019 to be the bottom for a year over year revenue growth  We expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2020  We expect 2020 to be the bottom in terms of operating margins with margins beginning to accelerate in 2021 and really hitting stride in  22 
The key driver for our operating margin guidance is the impact of gross margins as we scale our SaaS business and I ll drill into this in a moment  We have ranges here for 2022 through 2024 and we will finalize our 2020 guidance with our 2019 year end results in January  Looking ahead  we expect to phase out new perpetual licensing for Workspace over the course of 2020  while providing customers the new on premise licenses  a term subscription license 
Overall  as you can see  our subscription acceleration will increase the long term intrinsic value of the business by driving growth on the topline with operating leverage and scale falling to the bottom 
Let s turn to gross margins  Gross margins are a significant lever in the model and the main driver of our 2020 operating margins  We thought it would be helpful for you to get a better sense as to how we re thinking about this  particularly since we have a couple of dynamics that affect our gross margins 
First  we have an increasing mix of SaaS  which is a headwind to gross margins  However  as we continue to scale  we see those margins beginning to pick up  On the other hand  the networking business  our pooled subscription offering is sold with an appliance  making networking margins relatively constant over time  Longer term  we believe we have an opportunity to improve our gross margins as we scale the overall business 
As you saw in the earlier video of Microsoft  our relevance in enterprises continues as the IT landscape becomes ever more complex  Citrix remains the undisputed market leader in virtualization  which is a growing market  Our heritage in virtualization is yielding an enviable footprint across a wide array of large enterprises 
There is no doubt that this diversified footprint is a core reason behind the resilience of the business across economic cycles  This also provides us with an incredible opportunity to expand within our customer base as we layer in new features and functionality  Citrix has a solid foundation to increase our footprint with our existing customer base 
Workspace will continue to be a stable driver of growth for Citrix  With the third quarter reported Workspace revenue  we are confident that mid to high single digit growth is the right way to think about annual Workspace growth with acceleration in the outer years  As you saw from our third quarter  new product bookings in the Workspace grew double digits and Workspace is now 75  subscription for new bookings  Citrix is uniquely positioned to tap into the potential of our customer base  while also solving significant productivity and security pain points for our customers 
As our Workspace becomes more of a platform  it will be easier for us to layer over incremental revenue streams for customers segmenting users with technologies like VDI  Desktop as a Service  analytics and more  Over the course    of course  the Workspace is a major driver for our subscription growth and will continue to represent a significant part of our journey to the cloud  Yet  our overall transition to the cloud is accelerating as measured by SaaS bookings  revenue and paid subscribers 
It s worth noting that there are considerable differences in the rate and pace of the migration of our Workspace business relative to our networking business  While both businesses are transitioning  Workspace subscription bookings were 75  of total Workspace product bookings  whereas network subscription bookings were 29  of total network product bookings this quarter  We expect to exit this year with 60  to 65  of new product bookings from subscriptions  And with the Workspace already at 75  and increasing  we expect the headwinds to revenue growth to lessen over the next year 
Our subscription revenue continues to grow  We ended last year at  455 million of subscription revenue  This growth represents a three year compound average rate of 33  and the SaaS portion of our subscription revenue continues to grow  ending last year at 60  of overall subscription revenue  The primary driver of our subscription revenue growth has been the consistent strength we ve seen in our SaaS  Q3 subscription revenue grew 43  year over year  SaaS revenue as of the end of the third quarter represented 63  of our subscription revenue 
Let me drill down a little deeper into our SaaS revenue growth  To date  SaaS growth has been largely driven by selling new seats to new customers as well as selling new seats to existing customers  In other words  our SaaS growth has not been driven by the migration of existing customers  The other point worth noting is that we re seeing very strong growth from our SaaS Workspace 
The Workspace is growing considerably faster than our overall SaaS revenue  which includes the more modestly growing content collaboration offering  We expect the concentration of Workspace in SaaS to continue to increase  In 2017  the Workspace represented less than 20  of our total SaaS revenue  Today  exiting Q3 that number has climbed to over 50   and is by far the fastest growing portion of our portfolio 
I want to spend a few minutes discussing the economics of our subscription transition  It s important to note that we are really going through two transitions  one in the Workspace business  and the other in networking  We are driving our business transactions and our long range plan to these assumptions on pricing economics for new subscription deals 
Let s look first at the pricing economics of a new Workspace deal  For Workspace  we believe  on average our breakeven point for a subscription transaction versus a perpetual transaction will be 2 7 years  On the networking side  the economics are different for a new customer  Here it s gone to 3 5 years into the subscription transaction we hit the breakeven point versus the perpetual transaction  The key is  in both scenarios  we exit with substantially higher revenue 
Let s shift from the business economics of the subscription model to how this transaction is impacting our financial statements  Let s compare a three year perpetual transaction with a three year SaaS transaction and see how they impact our income statement  balance sheet and cash flow 
Let s start with the cash flow impact  which is reflected by the blue bars  In the perpetual license model  Citrix has historically billed upfront for the entire value of the contract versus a SaaS transaction  which is billed annually over the life of the transaction 
Now moving to the balance sheet  Short term and long term deferred are represented in the orange and red bars in the perpetual model  It s important to point out  that in the SaaS model  unbilled or pink bars are created  and these represent the value of the booking that has not been billed  Note that no long term deferred or red bar is created in the SaaS transaction 
Finally  from a revenue recognition perspective  the green bars are very different in the model  As you see  the short term deferred rolls off the balance sheet and revenue was recognized  As the examples show  the impact of our bookings coming from subscription will cause total deferred to continue to decelerate  and unbilled subscription to grow 
So now that we ve seen the economics and an example of how the model impacts our financial statements  how should you think about measuring our business  One metric we ve talked about is future committed revenue  It s important to understand that in perpetual deals  we were almost always successful in billing upfront for the entire value of the contract including initial maintenance  which could be purchased for up to five years at the time of the initial transaction 
We benefited on the face of our financial statements from the short term and the long term deferred revenue reflected in the upfront billings of these contracts  Today  we are generally writing three year SaaS contracts  billed annually which are not shown on our balance sheet  While it is useful to look at future committed revenue  it s important to note  this is impacted by contract duration  This is why we believe ARR is a more accurate measure of the success of our transition 
The bookings mix shift and the deferred revenue recognition means subscription revenue is expected to cross 30  of total revenue next year  We expect more than half of our revenue to be subscription by 2022  and this will approach 75  of total revenue in 2024  We expect our product bookings after  24 to be subscription 
As we progress through this transition  we know it s important to help you by anchoring around an important metric like free cash flow per share  Let s start with an important takeaway here  We re reconfirming our commitment to achieve  10 per share of free cash flow in 2022  We wanted to share with you the correlation we expect to see between the mix of subscription revenue and free cash flow per share 
We believe the accelerated transition to subscription  jump started by the phasing out of new perpetual licensing over the course of 2020 will allow us to achieve our 2022 targets  We will exit the transition with stronger revenue and free cash flow generation  We believe ARR is perhaps the single most useful metric to measure our performance in any given period  It normalizes the duration and it s forward looking  I want to point out that not everyone defines ARR in the same way  Our definition of ARR is a bottom up metric  built from actual customer contract data  which we believe is a great forward looking metric  ARR captures how well we serve new subscriptions as well as how successful we were in renewing existing subscriptions  while removing the impacts of duration and accounting  and the impact of other accounting measures 
There are three components of subscription ARR  which are consistent with the components of our subscription revenue  SaaS  subscription term licenses and transaction related activity or what we refer to as Citrix service providers  As you can see  we are seeing very consistent  robust growth in subscription ARR  And our growth is faster  when you look at SaaS ARR  We believe ARR is the most important metric in measuring our success in this business model transition 
We want to give you a view as to how we see the business evolving over the next several years through the course of the subscription transition and how we envision the business post transition  Subscription revenue  the phasing out of new perpetual Workspace licenses in 2020 will drive an acceleration of our subscription mix    of our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue  We see this as a 50  to 60  mix in 2022 and 65  to 75  in  24  exceeding 90  post transaction  We also see subscription bookings being in the 85  to 90  range after 2022 
In revenue growth  we expect to see an improvement in our revenue growth from the bottom we hit this year to a moderate increase next year of 3  to 4   accelerating to north of 10  per year after 2024 
On operating margin  we expect 2020 to represent the low point of our margin profile with a long term margin acceleration between 34  and 35  after 2024  As you can see  we expect what emerges on the other side to be a more predictable  faster growing and ultimately more valuable and sustainable business for us 
We remain vigilant in focusing on deploying capital to drive long term sustainable value for our shareholders  We think of capital allocation in three primary categories  our dividend  returning capital with a target of 75  of free cash flow in the form of share repurchases  historically  we ve done this in the form of regular programmatic purchases as well as accelerated share repurchases from time to time  and M A  when it adds value to both our business and our portfolio  And as you will see  this has resulted in significant capital being returned to our shareholders  We ve returned more than  5 5 billion of capital to our shareholders over the last five years and will continue to do so  We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders  Our capital return programs have resulted in a significant decline in our shares outstanding  And as you saw in the third quarter with our announcement  our Board has increased our share buyback authorization to  1 billion 
So in summary  we want to leave you here with three key takeaways  The first is that 2019 was a revenue low point  And in 2020  we expect to hit an inflection point and our revenue growth will accelerate  ARR and subscription mix are the key metrics we will use to measure our success and are the best indicators of where we are in our business model transition  We remain committed to  10 of free cash flow per share in 2022 and we will continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders

And start open Q A here  Just    we ll kind of make it interactive and there ll be handheld microphones that are moving around for anyone who has questions just raise your hand  we ll bring a microphone to you  We re going to do the mic just because we ve got    we re webcasting as well  We want to make sure that everybody online can hear the question at the same time  And I think it looks like we have about 30 to 45 minutes  So with that  why don t we just jump right in 
Unidentified Participant        Analyst
Thank you for hosting us today  It was a really excellent presentation  a lot of detail and we really appreciate that  I had two questions on the same topic which is  sort of  long term growth how to assess it and how to think about it over time  In terms of just assessing the growth of the business  I understand subscription ARR does all the right normalizations  I understand that  But assume like a big part of the story is actually moving the maintenance base to subscription over time  And so  I was wondering if we shouldn t have a view of what that maintenance base ARR looks like today and how that might influence the overall growth rate  if you put those two pieces together what does that growth rate look like  That s the first question 
And then on the second piece  if I look at the  sort of  long term guidance and I look at the impact of the subscription bookings made in the last two quarters  it suggests that you guys are growing in the high single digits today and that is going to continue for a prolonged period of time  which is great sustained growth  What are the drivers that are going to allow you to sustain it  because you re a  3 billion business  So sustaining growth at this scale is typically not many companies can do that  So is it pricing  is it seat expansion  is it the analytics story  what s going to give you that sustained growth over time  Those are my two questions  Thank you very much

Sure  Let me take the second question first  if my microphone is on  So if we think about the overall growth rate of the business  you just take a big step back and look at the underlying markets that we re operating in  I mean  the largest one and of course  the largest installed base is around virtualization  And that market is growing in the mid to high single digit range  And so  the opportunity continues to expand 
And then I would point you back to those    that slide that I had at the very beginning of my section where I just called out the fact that our customer base is expanding  we re addressing net new opportunities outside of our core markets that allow us to tap into new sources of budget revenue etc  We re adding new customers  And then as we migrate folks to Citrix Cloud on the new customer side  you looked at Arlen s slides about how that customer lifetime value accretes over a multi year period of time 
And then on the installed base piece  I mean  we didn t talk too much about that today  but that s because we ve been intentionally focused on net new versus installed base migration  That will start to pick up  It s been accelerating in the last couple of quarters and it will pick up going forward 
The uplift that we see from what a customer is paying today versus where they re going  we ve actually been yielding well over our target in the first few quarters  We re not talking about that as much simply because of the scale  And over time  we do expect that that uplift will come closer to our 30  uplift targets  but there s a huge opportunity there  And so as of today  we re well below this 10  threshold of what would have been the installed base a couple of years ago that has migrated  I don t think we re going to break out an additional ARR metric  I think the broader subscription and subset SaaS really brings that all together 
But overall  the categories we re participating in are continuing to grow in that mid to high singles  And so if I even step back and look at net new product bookings year to date across the Workspace and networking in particular  they re growing double digits and that s the best indicator 
And the first part of your question  I m sorry  did I answer that as well

Okay 
Mohit Gogia    Barclays    Analyst
Thanks for the presentation guys  It s really a lot you gave there  I so appreciate all the color  It s Mohit Gogia from Barclays  My question is for David and also PJ  if you can chime in  So initially  I think  you guys discussed that seat penetration  increasing that level of penetration is sort of like a core growth vector in the coming years obviously  And I was wondering if    and the platforms are moving from a solution    set to a platform or other point product set or platform set is sort of like going to allow you to increase that seat penetration 
But I m just wondering many other vendors your competitors  obviously  and many other vendors we cover talk about that platform sell motion  right  So what makes you confident from a customer conversation and from your sort of  like the access    the data access you have right now with the solutions  What makes you confident that Citrix is uniquely positioned to be able to provide that platform set 
David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  let me start there and then PJ can add on  A couple of things make us confident  We ve been talking about platform  it s not a new strategy  It s how we ve described the business over the last couple of years  And really what that is thinking about virtualization as a component part of the ability to address the needs and users    the needs of all users across the enterprise  So  it s more about this general purpose and special purpose  is the terminology you probably heard us use over the last few years 
What gives us confidence is that for 30 years now  customers have entrusted us to deliver their most mission critical applications  Those applications of all designs  And within that  those things are relatively transient  I mean  when you hear people use a platform today  most of those are frankly applications  And you look at the most prevalent  most popular apps from five years ago  half of those we don t even use anymore  So they    our point of view is that we need to provide that level of infrastructure where those can come and go over time 
We ve got 100 million people right now plus or minus that are using Citrix infrastructure today to be able to connect them from their enterprises and people and do it in a secure managed way  That s    and in many ways  that s almost a Trojan Horse that allows us to reduce the level of friction to be able to introduce new technologies to that base  but also making it easier for them to consume those at the same time  PJ 
PJ Hough    Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer
Yeah  let me just build on that  So I do think that thinking of our existing installed base and the virtualization footprint as a beachhead from which to build out the new set of capabilities is actually critical to us  And it s not just in terms of deployed technology  I think  it s also about our understanding of that market  understanding of applications  understanding of that delivery  and what it really takes to succeed on the dimensions that we talked about  which are actually quite diverse and continuing to expand whether it s networks devices  platforms users  etc  So  I think that s kind of key 
And then  I think the second part is  we ve taken a very specific and I would say unique perspective with regard to focusing on making the individual successful inside the organization  So  we re not really building a collaboration platform  We re not building something that is a shared experience for everybody  We really are trying to develop a point of view that says  having a tailored experience for the individual is the thing that s going to be a differentiated point of view over time  And that requires you to have a lot of insight about what makes my role in the organization different or special or how I behave relative to other users 
And this is where you re correct  Analytics is actually kind of key  We don t think of this as an orchestrated experience built by IT for the users  We think it s a curated experience that they initiate  but then that that evolves over time based on my usage of the system just like all of the sort of modern platforms that we use today in our personal lives  So  I think it s a combination of    I think leveraging the expertise and footprint we have with virtualization as a starting point  but then having made a set of deep investments  particularly around analytics and insight that I think really drives us in a very different direction to some of the other players in the market 
Kirk Materne    Evercore    Analyst
Hi  Kirk Materne  Evercore  Thanks for the presentation today  I really enjoyed the platform overview  I think that s really helpful  in terms of where your vision is going  I was just kind of curious maybe David and Mark could take this  Just in terms of getting to that vision with customers and the go to market routes you have to have with them  I think are very different than where you were five years  10 years ago  meaning this is a much more strategic discussion  it s maybe with the business owner  not just the IT part of the business  Where are you in that transition  is the partner side of the equation set up yet  meaning are the Deloittes  the Accenture is going to make you all the platform that helps customers stitch all this together 
And then  maybe just one last one for Arlen  Just on the return of capital to shareholders  maybe what s the thought process on not taking the dividend up just to create a little bit maybe a broader investor base that would come in and look at Citrix  not only as a growth vehicle  but also maybe as an income vehicle  just maybe your thought process on that 
So  two questions  Thanks 
David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive Officer
I can talk to the go to market  So  we started on this journey two years ago  when we started to talking to you about getting to the C level executive having a more strategic relationship  And we have been transitioning the organization  not only from a capacity standpoint  but from a skill standpoint  And so  we ve been on this journey for a while because we ve known where we re going  Certain geographies aren t where we want them to be like maybe Indonesia is not    with 200 million users is now where we want it to be  but our major geographies like Japan  Australia  the UK  those have clearly started to make that transition  And our sales force has complemented that right 
With that said  our partner organization we ve also been working on and again that is somewhat of a journey  but our partner organization  particularly our best partners have come along with us in a very rapid pace  And we are going to invest significantly on the systems  integrator side because building micro apps around a platform is hugely valuable to them and to us and to our customers  So  we re on that journey  but like you said  it does happen overnight  right 
So  Arlen 
Arlen Shenkman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I m not sure we thought a ton about dividend in terms of our long range plan and planning for years  So I mean  certainly open to a conversation  if you want to think about it  Honestly  I mean obviously  it s apparent once you have a dividend  it s forever  And so  there is a little flexibility financially  But frankly in terms of this presentation and how we re laying out  where we re taking the business  we didn t spend a lot of time thinking about the dividend 
PJ Hough    Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer
Maybe I ll add maybe one comment on the system integrators and on platform  because I think it s important  I think one of the things that we realized when we began exploring this space with customers was the pace at which they would want to go  to build solutions on the Workspace  was going to outpace what we could do  if we decided to build all of the integrations ourselves  And so  that s really the point at which we ve basically flipped to thinking more about building as a platform  opening it up  and frankly creating market opportunity for industry specialists  and geographic specialists to go deliver complete Workspace solutions into corners of the market that frankly we couldn t reach any time soon  So  really that s a key part of our strategy is not just building that platform  but engaging with that community 
The developer conference that we had  we had 100 attendees  And it was one third corporate IT developers  who we want to ensure are capable of building solutions inside their own organizations  one third ISVs who build solutions that are commercial  that we wanted them to build their solution on the Workspace platform  and integrate with us  and one third global system integrators  So  very much a target for our platform  and I think one of the accelerants for growth  and taking this into some of the broader deployments 
David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive Officer
In the back 
Karl Keirstead    Deutsche Bank    Analyst
Hi  Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank way in the back  Maybe this question is for Arlen  Arlen  your stock increasingly trades on cash flow  And so  I m sensitive to your outlook on that metric  And I m frankly surprised by the acceleration you re modeling in free cash flow to  7 to  8 a share in 2020  That s way above what I was thinking  And my base assumption at least was that  the weight of this transition would much like it is on margins carry through and weigh on cash flow next year  but that doesn t seem to be the case  And you re suggesting that this year s a trough on free cash flow  And we get a fairly market acceleration next year  So do you mind just unpacking that a little bit and what gives you that confidence  Thanks 
Arlen Shenkman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  So I think    look  there s a reason there s a range in there  And there are a lot of moving parts around the transition  right  So  we still have a subscription license  We have a SaaS license  We have customers who are continuing to come off of the network business  So there s a lot of moving parts in there  So I mean  I think  that that s one piece of it  We remain confident that as we go through the transition  those parts will continue to add value  And then as we accelerate into that subscription transition  the cash will become much more significant  So in the short term  I think  there s a range in there because of that  And in the long term  we feel confident we can get to the target of  10 in 2022 because of the ultimate transition  And this year  there s a little more room in that kind of swim lane  but we remain confident we can get there 
David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive Officer
Karl  let me just address that specifically  And so  one of the things that Arlen talked about in his presentation was  we ripped the band aid off about three months ago to really drive a more rapid transition of    especially the Workspace business and you saw that coming out of this quarter at 75  of the mix 
And we ve been trying to thread the needle for far too long on that and really holding back the pace of the transition  And we are actively going to migrate that to 100  of that business  plus or minus next year  So  accelerating the transition allows us to get through that trough much  much faster than the amount of cash that is effectively coming into the P L versus being deployed hits that equilibrium point and starts to drive the acceleration going forward with the acceleration of revenue growth  etc 
Karl Keirstead    Deutsche Bank    Analyst
Got it  Thanks Arlen 
Ittai Kidron    Oppenheimer    Analyst
Hi  Over here  Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer  And again  thanks for the presentation  It was very helpful  a lot of details  Clearly  you ve made a great progress on Workspace  kind of driving down to SaaS and it s clearly translating and having a big impact    positive impact now finally on your numbers 
My question is on the networking side of the equation  where you re far earlier in your transition there  help me compare and contrast it  how I should think about your networking transition going forward versus Workspace  Where are you in the portfolio in getting that transition accelerated from this point going forward  that s going to have to carry a little bit more of the mix change going forward 
And is there also sort of like a hard break off that can happen over there in the same way that you intend to terminate perpetual licensing on the Workspace  could that happen on the networking side as well 
David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive Officer
PJ  why don t you about talk about    remind everybody where we are from a product standpoint and I ll come back and talk about the licensing side 
PJ Hough    Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer
So  I think you re correct that we are early    and not just we re earlier  I d say the market is earlier in the transition to basically that software defined cloud based networking for enterprise customers  I think you really have to think about what s been happening with cloud in sort of two camps  one is either net new applications that have gotten built on cloud platforms are new entrants into the cloud platform market  but for existing enterprise customers and their largest state of applications  that isn t much earlier stage with regard to figuring out how to migrate 
And frankly  that s the one where we participate the most  because it is really customers trying to protect the deep investments they ve had in the delivery of those applications as they bring them into the cloud  So  from a road map perspective  I would say we re well on our way to delivering the capabilities  And we actually have customers  who in Q3 were further down my waterfall model  basically cloud native networking customers  who have bet exclusively on our Citrix networking solution  But they are  I would say  leading indicators of that transition  It is much earlier in stage  And so  that s I think where we are from a product point of view 
The part I feel good about is given that we have strong software assets that are highly deployable across all the form factors you need  whether it s appliance or it s a container or it s a virtual instance  or in fact bare metal  which we are now doing with some of the cloud platform partners  We believe that we can deploy the type of networking you need as you    as the customers get there  They re just not there yet  And I think that s partly where we are 
I ll make one comment before I turn it over to David on the licensing  just my perspective  which is  given that there s a hardware component  I think it s going to be    the transition to full subscription is going to have a different pace based on that  And that hardware business  as we talked about in a hybrid world  actually had some endurance  So that s still something we have to keep in mind 
David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  I was going to reiterate that point as well  I mean  it s    the underlying market is going to change at a much different rate and pace  So if you look at our disclosures  we ve moved about 30  of new bookings toward subscription where we were roughly 10  or so a year ago  So it s moved up pretty quickly  I think net new product bookings last quarter  for example  grew mid single digits  somewhere in that range  which is probably in line with the overall market growth for that part of networking  But over time  it s going to look more and more like software and subscription  And so  that is our expectation 
So how quickly we can get it above 50  is still a bit of an open question  That s one that is    it s harder for us to force  just given the hardware components and other things  And one of the reasons why we continue to pivot those businesses a little bit away from being an ADC solution much more toward Workspace security  Workspace delivery and optimization across really where people are going versus just changing the architecture of where they ve been  So that s probably the way I would infer that out 
PJ Hough    Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer
And we put the commercials in place to make that very attractive for our customers  right  so   
Mark Moerdler    Bernstein Research    Analyst
Mark Moerdler  Bernstein Research  I want to thank you very much for giving all the data  That was a difficult process  explaining  building out all the data and everything else  And I think there s a lot here that can help people really understand what s happening in the transition and the fact that you re ripping the band aid off on the process 
Two questions if you don t mind  The first is  Arlen  I would agree with you that ARR is the key metric people need to look at  One of the questions we do get from clients is the question relating to deferred and the other metrics that people have historically looked  And that when you have an Adobe style move from license only to cloud  you get this big lift in deferred  Can you give us a little color on why that s lagging a little bit in the process of how it s not growing or growing as fast as some people might expect 
And then  there s another quick question beyond that  Where are you at this point in maintenance transition on Workspace  Is it 10  of the maintenance has started to move  Is it a smaller number  Any sense of where you are I think will help people realize how much still is ahead of you  Thank you 
Arlen Shenkman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Let me take the deferred and then I ll hand it over to Mark on the maintenance  On the deferred  so it s this piece of the business which is the pre billing on the deferred  So  it s the headwind in the deferred  And so what    essentially  because of those five year contracts  because there s so much was pre billed  because there s a history of that  then that builds up a significant amount of current and long term deferred  And so  it s that headwind in the business that we re trying to eliminate so that we can come through this 
And that s really what s driving the change  And I totally get that it s different than Adobe and Autodesk and everyone else  because very few people have the ability  Most people  if they could prepay maintenance for five years  if you could get that cash in the door  you do it any day  It s just not a market practice anymore and we just have people continuing to do it  which is causing this kind of a lot of the two  which is confusing the story 
Mark Moerdler    Bernstein Research    Analyst
That helps 
David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  Let me put a fine point on that because I think it s an important one  So  just to reiterate that  I mean customers historically not only have purchased a perpetual license  but on average  a couple of years of initial maintenance  And two thirds of those would have paid for the entire thing upfront  Now  we re moving the entire business model to annual billings  That s why the growth in unbilled revenue has just accelerated so rapidly at the expense of deferred revenue  So  we talk about future committed revenue is kind of the combination of those  2 billion plus right now growing about 13  year on year  And those are    that s really the one place that plus the impact on cash flows obviously in the short term are the areas that you see this pronounced change 
Arlen Shenkman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Then to answer your first question  I make around the installed base  we re somewhere between 7  and 8  of the maintenance base has begun to transition  Part of that though if you go back to the go to market portion of my presentation  it s because we ve really enabled the sales force and directed their incentives toward new business  Over the course of 2020  we ll be opening that up such that the acceleration of the transition  the maintenance base should transition at an accelerated pace to where you ve seen it to date 
Mark J  Schmitz    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer
Next questions 
Mark Schilsky    UBS O Connor    Analyst
Mark Schilsky  UBS O Connor  Arlen  I think you said earlier that you are going to end perpetual licensing next year  When is that going to happen  Or are you going to put out an announcement to your customers sometime before then get them ready for that 
Arlen Shenkman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So  we re in a process now of ensuring that we have the right internal communications  which we ve started to cascade  We re obviously working on our compensation plans to drive behavior  We re working with our partners to drive behavior  We re not going to give an exact date  I can tell you that  we re obviously incentivized to make it happen as early as we can from a financial standpoint  We ll obviously be considerate of what s happening in the channel and the marketplace 
And to answer your question  we ve already started a cascade  We ve already started to communicate and we re already    we already have plans around how we will help accelerate that  but we re not going to give a hard date 
David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive Officer
And just to be very clear on that point  we are not eliminating on premise deployments  I think everyone knows that a lot of our customers are on a long cloud journey  And so  there is plenty of choice in terms of how they consume our products on premise  Lot of those will probably utilize a term based subscription as we go forward and we ll do the right thing for customers  But when we re talking specifically about the financial model  this is the acceleration that we started in the last two quarters  three quarters  and we want to drive that through next year 
Heather Bellini    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Wanted to ask a little bit about    Heather Bellini at Goldman Sachs  ARR is obviously an important metric as you guys all cited  I m wondering if you ve given any thought to changing what you guide to and actually start maybe guiding to ARR as a metric that people can benchmark you off of 
And then secondarily  we do get asked this all the time  Dan and I were just talking about this  You get questions from people where again going back to the deferred question  everyone understands they pay you less upfront and obviously that impacts long term deferreds versus people who are paying you upfront before  But from a short term billings perspective  I think that s one area if you could flush out a little bit more about the typical contract value or the dollars that you re taking in  I know you did that slide  but I m just thinking about it from a short term deferred perspective  so people can put that into perspective  when they re thinking about that and how it impacts cash flow  Thank you 
PJ Hough    Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer
I ll refer to you on the value of the contracts  I mean on the ARR guidance  look  it s a new metric for us  We re obviously    we started it two quarters ago  It doesn t mean we wouldn t provide guidance  I don t think we have an intent right now  As you get more comfortable with it  we ll think about that  But right now  it s brand new metric for us and we ll continue to report it and we ll consider that  On the pricing piece  I ll give that to you 
Mark J  Schmitz    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer
Well  I ll only add to his comment  As we go into next year  our incentives will line up with that whole thinking as well  So  as we go to our sales force  it will line up specifically where he is at today 
PJ Hough    Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer
And then  just on deferred  it s going to be a combination of long and short term deferred will be impacted by seasonality  contract  what we re billing upfront  how much is consumption base that we re billing on a monthly basis  all those factors play in  And that s why we re going to continue to give all the pieces  so that you can see all of them together in the context of future committed revenue 
Mark J  Schmitz    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer
Next question  Anymore questions 
All right  It looks like we ve actually reached the end of question  So  with that  let me just say on behalf of Citrix and all of us up here  a huge thank you for everyone for participating here today  I appreciate you being here in person and appreciate everyone who is joining us online  I think we re at a really interesting inflection point in the Company s history right now and we re very much focused on driving this transition over the next couple of years  Thank you very much  Talk to you again in the next three months

Chief Executive Officer for some introductory remarks David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Traci  and good afternoon  everyone  Thanks for joining the call  I hope everybody has had a chance to review the earnings letter that we posted a little while ago to our Investor Relations site  Similar to last quarter  let me provide just a quick summary here and then we ll jump right into Q A  I would say  overall really happy with our performance for the fourth quarter It s highlighted by 41  year over year growth in subscription ARR  49  growth in SaaS ARR  and a 15  increase in deferred and unbilled revenue  I would say our model transition continues to progress really well across both Workspace and Networking businesses coming ahead of the accelerated plan that we outlined just last year In the quarter  69  of total product bookings came via subscription and this is up from just 51  a year ago  In fact  in this quarter  we signed a couple of the largest Networking contracts in our history and we signed those as multi year subscriptions  really reflecting the customer confidence  our strategy roadmap  and our ability to execute on where that market is going Also our new Workspace with intelligence platform is made generally available in December  Personally  I think  this is the most significant feature functionality release that we brought to market since the introduction of the Workspace  Good platform and we ll be driving and scaling over the coming years  So all in  really good quarter  solid progress against our multi year goals So with that let me open it up for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo Phil Winslow    Wells Fargo    AnalystHey  thanks guys for taking my question  And congrats on a great end of the year  Just want to actually focusing in on the Networking business  Obviously  David  you called out some pretty significant transactions there as well as a pretty big shift to the pooled capacity licensing  Wondering if you could just walk us through that  And Arlen wondering if you could help us just think through sort of the net impact of that because obviously it was a big step up in terms of the subscription bookings this quarter David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Phil  Yeah  let me take the first part  So from a strategy standpoint  I think as everyone knows  what we ve been trying to do is really leverage the fact that we re a software company  And we can deploy our networking services across just a myriad of different form factors  as appliance and software  virtual appliance as a service and a container etc  And we just have a lot of flexibility to do that and we ve got a unique control plane that I mean we call it ADM that effectively allows customers to manage across all of those different deployment models  And that ties really nicely with the hybrid multi cloud nature of most customer s infrastructure  With the transition that s going on in terms of application architectures that s just really  really nice bridge for a lot of customers  So we re pushing that as our primary model and that is what s driving pooled capacity  It s just a strategic thing  but it s also a longer term business model shift As you saw  we had a really big pop in terms of the overall mix in the quarter going up to 63  from  18  That was influenced  as I mentioned  a minute ago by a couple of really large transactions  I wouldn t expect that to be the run rate  That percentage will come back down  but generally it continues to be and up into the right motion Arlen Shenkman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean  you know what I would add to that Phil  as David said  I mean  look if you look at the full year  you know for the full year for the networking business  we basically ended at 44  mix and that s compared to 13  come out of  18  I don t think we re going to hold that  But I think we do see our customers buying into our strategy  they do like our pooled licensing arrangement  And I think honestly what I tell you is  I think  you ll see this start to show itself in ARR and that s probably the best place to focus as we go through this Phil Winslow    Wells Fargo    AnalystGot it  Thanks guys David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Phil OperatorYour next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs Heather Bellini    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  thank you so much  David  I have a couple of questions  if you don t mind  I guess in no particular order  you guys signed I think it was a million Citrix Cloud seats in the quarter  if I m reading your press release correctly  which is a pretty big uptick  I m just wondering if you could walk people through what s driving that and there s always a lot of debate in the market  how much of this is being driven from Windows 7 End of Life  And then I ve got two quick follow ups  if you don t mind  Thank you David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  you re right  As far as paid subscriber count we ended Q4 with 7 1 million  That s up more than 60  year over year from just over 4 million  What s really driving that is just a continuation of the overall strategy that we ve been talking about now for a couple of years  From a current customer standpoint  migrating to Citrix Cloud does a few things One  it really simplifies their ability to maintain their infrastructure to have lots of tools and services to optimize that and drive that forward  and allow us to do the heavy lifting that we can scale across just really all of our customers  And so it s a huge benefit on just the pure like for like  but probably much more importantly  though is  it unlocks a lot of new capabilities that are really only available as a service  and whether that is something as simple as endpoint management and a unified basis across all of their infrastructure to some of our net new capabilities like Workspace with Intelligence  which will only be available as a service  So it s a combination of really optimizing what they have today for those set of customers  but it provides that foundation for them to grow going forward And so we re just  I think we re doing a better and better job every quarter of articulating the value  Our sales teams are having conversations higher up in the    in the executive ranks  And we re talking about things that are  I would describe it as really information type initiatives  much more so than a traditional IT delivery initiatives  So it s a combination of all of those different factors Heather Bellini    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  great  And then the two quick follow ups would be  if you could just remind us  obviously you ve been going through the subscription transition  And as a result of that there is a headwind to revenue growth  Could you remind us on based on your current expectations about mix  whether you want to take the midpoint or not  What type of headwind to revenue growth is that for 2020  And then the other question would be just subscription ARR growth for 2020  I mean obviously I heard your comments about being up 41  in Q4  Any commentary on the type of growth  people might be able to expect out of that subscription ARR for this year  Thank you David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Heather  we re not going to guide from a subscription ARR standpoint at least in 2020  And that s simply a function of    it s a relatively new metric we want to make sure that it is one that we can have forecasting with really  really good accuracy  But more importantly  I would take a step back  and you look at it just over the last few quarters  That s where all of this business model transition is starting to unwind  I think  if I remember correctly  it was 33  growth in Q2  40  in Q3  41  in Q4  So we re actually seeing an acceleration of that as the numbers get bigger  And that s just a reflection of both net new  which is still the majority  as well as migrating more of the installed base going forward  Yeah and I m sorry  could you repeat the first half of the    Heather Bellini    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  just the last question was the headwind to 2020 revenue growth from the transition  if you kind of take the midpoint of your expectations on where you will be subscription mix  how should we people be thinking about the headwind that you re experiencing to top line this year David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  we didn t break it out in terms of guidance for 2020  but back when we started this transition  we were posting the headwind and it was in that 700 basis point  800 basis point range  We stopped doing that just because we ve got ARR out there and I think everybody is well aware of the transition metrics  but it was 7 percentage points or 8 percentage points the last time we reported it Heather Bellini    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah OperatorYour next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank Karl Keirstead    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThank you  Maybe I ll start with Arlen  In the earnings letter  you gave the 2020 guidance  but I didn t see a reiteration of the  7 to  8 per share in free cash flow  So maybe a two parter for you  still feel comfortable with that  And then secondly  I know that as the installed base converts to ratable  there is the potential for billing or invoicing durations to compress a little bit  which would take a little bit of zip out of free cash flow  Have you seen any of that kind of duration compression over the last couple of months  Thank you Arlen Shenkman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So Karl  I start with yeah  look we remain comfortable with the  7 to  8 that s obviously included in our guidance in terms of what we delivered at Investor Day  and there is no change in that  And as you point out rightfully  obviously there are some complexities in terms of how the duration affects the cash to get in the door  when they get in the door  hence the range as well as how we think about the business In terms of your question about compression  I haven t really seen compression  I think anything if you look at the length is a bit longer actually in terms of duration  We had 1 7 years  Obviously  we are generally entering into 36 month contracts  So we d expect that duration to continue  but obviously in terms of how we think about cash flow  I mean  the biggest impact for us is the mix over the course of the year and how that results itself or reflects itself in the business  I don t know if you want to add anything to that  David David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Karl  I think you re not asking about the duration on the contract  which has been going out  I think it s more about prepayment and that   Karl Keirstead    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThat s right David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerThat absolutely has been a headwind because a year or two ago when we talked about the majority of our customers  not only we re buying perpetual license  but we re also buying multi years of maintenance and paying for that upfront  As we ve been unwinding that model to get to a much more pure  just a pure run rate  that s been a tremendous headwind to cash flow  And that s pretty much run its course  I mean we haven t broken it out in a couple of quarters  but it is    it s a very low percentage now versus where it was  So I think that headwind is pretty much gone at this point Karl Keirstead    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  great  And then maybe my second question for you  David is just  this earnings call is really in the earnings letter and in your words really putting a little bit more focus on the 4Q launch of these intelligence analytics features you described is the most significant functionality at Workspace in your history  So I wouldn t mind given that pressing a little bit  So I know that they just went GA  probably a little over a month ago but David  any early anecdotes or numbers you can share that for instance when installed base contracts are up for renewal in December or so far in January  those that have acquired the new features  you tend to see revenue accretion of X  Anything interesting you can share that would kind of support the view that this could be a needle mover for Citrix David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Karl  I would say  at a high level it s different than the old days of perpetual license when a new release was a joint event  This is much more about evolving the platform  And so the way we ve positioned this with customers really over the last year and we ve been pretty  pretty transparent about this  is that  this is the direction that the Workspace is really moving  It s moving toward a platform approach that allows us to really provide a solution that s applicable to users of all type  whether those users have very simple needs like Office 365 and a couple of SaaS applications or whether that is the group of users that need all the power of virtualization VDI  etc And so the platform allows us to really cover all of those on a wall to wall basis and then provide that level of segmentation from an end user standpoint  the right tool to the right solution  but also a platform that we can continue to drive upsell opportunities  so that we can have an ongoing customer conversation about new things that we re bringing to the market  For example  security analytics  performance analytics and others that we haven t announced at this point in time  And so the big shift is just how we engage and think about the Workspace  and it s going to be moving much more from a organizing IT focus where I think we were over the course of the last couple of years to much more about modernizing applications  guiding and helping predict work And so that s a big shift and that s an exciting conversation that we re having now with not just CIOs  but I mean more and more frequently people that carry titles like Chief Digital Transformation Officer  Chief Marketing Officer and others  So we re excited about it  but I think it s going to be just a gradual thing that we continue to ramp throughout the year Karl Keirstead    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGot it  OK  Thank you  both OperatorYour next question is from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research Mark Moerdler    Bernstein Research    AnalystThank you and congratulations on the quarter  Nice clean results  I got a couple of questions for you  but I ll keep it simple  Can you give us an update on where you are on the process of no longer selling the Citrix Burst Workspace licenses and how do you think  if any had made an impact on Q4 license sales  Did it create a larger than normal license sales in the quarter and then I have a follow up David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo  Mark  let me just grab that  Look  we talked at Investor Day about end licensing perpetual plus maintenance  We are in the process of working that through our system  You see no impact of that in the fourth quarter  We have not implemented that  You ll continue to hear us talk about through the course of the year  but we have not taken any action and there is no reflection of that in our current year end results Arlen Shenkman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd we know for bookings mix  there was already three quarter subscription in the Workspace  So the impact will be relatively muted on a go forward basis Mark Moerdler    Bernstein Research    AnalystOkay  And then can you give us any sort of an update on where you are on the  on the  what was existing installed base of Citrix Workspace in terms of how much is moving or are you seeing any bigger opportunity  Any color on where that on the installed base starting to move up to subscription and cloud David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  let me take that one  We re early on still  I d say that number is right around less than 10  of the installed base  The installed base continues to move even because we are still selling perpetual licenses  So the installed base is growing  while we transition  The amount of transition has moved up pretty materially over the last couple of quarters  probably most importantly that we re still yielding the level of uplift that we talked about at our Financial Analyst Meeting  while the numbers get bigger  So I think the opportunity is pretty significant and we ll be doing much more of that throughout 2020 Mark Moerdler    Bernstein Research    AnalystExcellent  Really appreciate it  Thanks David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYou bet OperatorYour next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies Parthiv Varadarajan    Jefferies    AnalystYeah  thanks  This is Parthiv on for Brent  In terms of the outlook  I think  the letter indicates that guidance for 2020 assumes a subscription bookings mix of 65  to 75   And if I m looking at this right  you were expecting up to 80  at the Analyst Day  So I guess the question is  are your assumptions in the business is changing at the margin here or are they still within the band that you had expected back at the Analyst Day David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I don t think anything has changed here  I mean if you see there is obviously some seasonality  We ve talked about the first quarter being much closer to the 55  to 60  range  You see us for the full year looking at 65  to 75  and that s consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day  Obviously  over time  we will go beyond that 75   but when we think about 2020  we think that s the right way to approach it  And it s very consistent with what we went over in terms of our roadmap and our plans for the business Parthiv Varadarajan    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  got it  And then for the CSP business  I think  the last data point that we got was in the second quarter of  19  I think you talked about a  100 million run rate  Maybe any update on that end in terms of run rate or growth rates and maybe talk about the mix between on prem CSP versus the cloud David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Parthiv  it s not something that we really break out much anymore  I think now that we re into the complete subscription transition all of these things are just included in the overall number  And it would just confuse people to try and break out individual piece parts  Overall though  CSP is a channel program that allows channel partners to leverage our infrastructure to create as a service offerings for their end customer  It has been a great business like you highlighted  continues to be so  And it is in nine figures and growing  I don t really know where those customers are in terms of on prem or cloud infrastructure Obviously  over the long term they have a lot more flexibility as they move to Citrix Cloud  but it just depends on the size of the partner Parthiv Varadarajan    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  fair enough  That s helpful  Thank you OperatorYour next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citi Walter Pritchard    Citi    AnalystHey  David  A product question for you  Just as it relates to Windows Virtual Desktops  I think Microsoft launched in Q4  how have you found that that offering from Microsoft being out there impacting your business  Is it creating awareness  Is it causing some confusion  helping the transition to subscription  Just curious what if any impact you re seeing at this point David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think  WVD at a high level really opens up the awareness for virtualization as a platform  and we look at it as a platform or in our language you know resource zone where we can allow customers to run parts of their infrastructure along with like on prem or in another cloud or public cloud  etc  So it s a resource zone from that respect When it was first announced  it created some market confusion  and so between Citrix and Microsoft  we ve been spending a lot of time educating our field  We just had our sales kickoff a week ago  We had Microsoft and Citrix on stage really talking to all of our partners and our sellers about what the real separation is  how to position and how we work together because this is really a story about better together with Microsoft  And we spend a lot of time highlighting everything we re doing from a joint customer standpoint  joint field standpoint  all the product integrations and we re going to continue to do that  So no change on that front Walter Pritchard    Citi    AnalystGreat  And then Arlen for you just on    I want to make sure I was clear on the networking piece  the subscription mix went up substantially there  Is that a trend that you think is sustainable as we move forward or was there some element with a flexible licensing in Q4 that drove customers to choose that offering  that may not be sustainable here in the first half of 2020 Arlen Shenkman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo I think what you ll continue to see is growth  I think the magnitude and I think the data point I d try to utilize that 13  to 44  for the year  I think that magnitude is driven by some of the larger deals we did  So I m very confident that we ll continue to see customers move in that direction  I believe we re very confident in the fact that you ll continue to see an increase  I just    one  we re just not confident is that that magnitude in terms of the moving parts in the business  the number of customers who will be that consistent in terms of driving that Walter Pritchard    Citi    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorYour next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley Mark    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  Mark O Neil  Phonetic  for Keith Weiss  Thanks  Thanks for taking my question  Maybe two quick ones on converting that existing maintenance base that we ve been talking about  One  I guess just how big is that maintenance base in terms of like licenses that could be transitioned  And then two  yield it s still less than like 10  of the way through like at Analyst Day on October  I guess looking into the next few years when you continue focusing on transitioning that base maybe just like level set expectations  how  like how much should we be thinking about per year maybe is like 10  or is that too high or too low kind of some way to think about that would be helpful in modeling David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  we re not going to guide to a specific percentage basis  We re obviously looking to build the right programs to go as fast as customers want to go  and we re not planning on any type of a forced migration  it s simply going to be put the right programs in front of them  give them the sense of value  and allow customers to adopt this  That part has been growing from a internally we call it trade up and transition  it s growing very rapidly right now  it is still the minority focus  So I want to be clear about that  We are still more focused on selling net new licenses to both new and existing customers and then trade up becomes a secondary motion But in terms of the overall magnitude  I mean  just look at    look at the P L and you see the support in services line  the bulk of that is related to ongoing maintenance contracts although both hardware and software  So it s well over  1 billion opportunity there from an ongoing maintenance standpoint  And we just want to make sure that we re converting that at the uplift that we ve been seeing up to this point and we re doing it methodically  So the customers really drive the value that they see in the solutions We re also starting to incent channel partners on things like active use to make sure that not only are we migrating customers  but we re driving the right level of use and providing that platform  so that as we get onto Workspace with Intelligence and some of these new capabilities  we have that pathway to sell new things  new updates  new add ons  new capabilities and so that s the overall motion we re driving right now Mark    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  thanks so much OperatorYour next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Mohit Gogia    Barclays    AnalystHey guys  it s Mohit Gogia on for Raimo  Thanks for taking my question  I ll also offer my congrats on the quarter  on a solid quarter  Two questions  So one  David  I was wondering if you can drill into just the SSP business performance  So obviously we saw a nice rebound this quarter just based on the easier  much easier comps from last year  But looking into 2020 like should we expect the same volatility just based on the seasonality and the comps for next year as well or is there anything else we should be aware off  And then I have a question for Arlen David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Sure  I mean  it s just at a high level  I mean SSP will continue to break it out for a while because it is volatile  It s a small handful  It s now down to  I don t know  3   4  of total revenue  So it s not material  but it does move around a little bit  It s going to continue to be volatile  Although  I will say that part of the strategy that we re driving right now is to work with these customers on the multi year types of arrangements  So while there will always be a hardware element focus much more of the engagement on long term software  containers  and those types of things to support where their businesses are going  So I would say that the volatility will become less and less pronounced over time  but it will still be there for a while  but just keep it in the context of it  it s 3  or 4  of total revenue  So it s not that big a deal Mohit Gogia    Barclays    AnalystUnderstood  That s helpful  And Arlen just one question  just a modeling question on deferred  So I mean based on the commentary that we have heard around that you guys are facing away the multi year maintenance contracts being billed upfront  We would have thought that there will be somewhat more of a headwind on deferred this quarter  Obviously  we saw some nice seasonal uptick  the sequential uptick  but if you can give us some more color as to how that sort of like phasing away from multi year maintenance will show up in deferred  maybe it hasn t been rolled out yet  but just some more color on deferred for modeling will be helpful Arlen Shenkman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean  I think  look I would go back  if you take a step back and we talked a lot about this at Investor Day  But when you think about the business  I would say  the first way to kind of think about the normalization is look at ARR  After you move away from ARR  you re going to start to get an idea of where we re headed in terms of our future committed revenues and you ll see more and more of that buildup obviously in unbilled in terms of how that will react in the business And then and one of the reasons I started with ARR is because one of the things that you ll have to deal with and that we ll deal with in terms of how we model and think about our business is the effect of 606  And as we do on prem term licenses and how those kind of pull in how that have an effect on the business  And so even though we ll continue to move away from prepaid maintenance  you re going to continue to see movement around that deferred line and as you said we had an uptick in seasonality We feel good particularly on a quarter by quarter basis when you look at that where we re headed  But obviously there s going to continue to be volatility depending on mix and some of that mix is not only the mix in terms of SaaS  but it s on prem term licenses as well as the pooled licenses we have for the Networking business  which is all going to have an impact and it s going to move across our short term and long term deferred Mohit Gogia    Barclays    AnalystSounds good  Thanks guys OperatorYour next question is from Robert Majek with Raymond James Robert Majek    Raymond James    AnalystGreat  thanks a lot  Can you give us an update on Citrix Managed Desktops and how the sell through has been so far with your partners and customers  And then additionally  is this an offering we will see you put more emphasis on going forward David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  CMD  just for everybody  That is our fully packaged DaaS offering that we re building with Microsoft on top of Windows Virtual Desktops  It s really a complete well  a complete way to give customers a turnkey service  Those things are just now    just now going live  So there s not a whole lot of history yet  but we ll look at it and talk about it much more going forward  It s similar to the way I described the platform earlier  where the important part of the strategy is laid the foundation so that we ve got a platform approach that covers all users regardless of their end  kind of their end user requirements and then have those individual solutions that allow us to continue to segment users much more specifically based on their usage  So that could be a full VDI solution  it could be a Citrix Managed Desktop  it could be just simply analytics I mean it s that level of flexibility that I think is most critical going forward  So stay tuned  in a couple of quarters  we ll provide an update just in terms of overall uptake  But I think the story that we talk about is going to be much more platform oriented Robert Majek    Raymond James    AnalystThanks a lot OperatorYour final question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI Kirk Materne    Evercore Partners    AnalystYes  thanks  Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter  I guess  David  the question I have for you is coming away from the sales kickoff  And as you go through this transition the Workspace is being more of a platform  Can you just talk about how you re thinking about sort of the evolution of the partner ecosystem  As you guys are now starting to talk to decision makers outside just the IT universe  Traditionally that s been an area where the tradition  the global system integrators will come in and oftentimes help sort of grease the skids in terms of helping software companies along in terms of their platform strategy  I m just trying to get a sense on where you guys stand on that and maybe if there is any points of validation we can take away from potential partnerships that help  I think  speak to the direction you guys are heading in  Thanks David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I can t talk about specific partnerships that aren t really announced publicly  but I can tell you that you re right it was a big focus of last week talking about the overall message selling into a different set of buyers and it s a journey that we ve been on for a few years  So it hasn t been totally net new  However  the conversation that I had sitting down with a large group of our GSI partners was much more focused on  This is a platform  this is one that a lot of them have been engaged in  in terms of helping build out micro apps and things as beta customers and whatnot  because the long term engagement with them comes from how they build unique and differentiated businesses around some of these capabilities not just using them as a tool as part of a larger engagement  but actually as a foundation to build a practice around it  that s the direction that we would be working with them on to help become real So good engagement with GSIs  continue to work with our traditional set of partners both on new and installed base customers  So the message was pretty holistic last week  I think we ve got good alignment across our sellers  lot of transition  as you would imagine  we re moving to much more of a continuous engagement model  which is typical for a cloud company versus one that sells individual point products  But that s a journey we ve been on for a while  And so I think each and every quarter we re getting a little bit better at it  and we ve got a pretty good  pretty good view of where we need to be over the course of the next couple of years Kirk Materne    Evercore Partners    AnalystThat s helpful  thanks very much David J  Henshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  It sounds like that was the last question  So again  I just want to wrap up and thank you everybody for joining us again this afternoon  Really nice way for us to end the year  coming off a strong fourth quarter  We re obviously optimistic about 2020 with everything we re doing across both go to market and product area  Look forward to speaking with many of you throughout the quarter and reporting back with our first quarter results in April  So thank you very much and have a good night

140540,362055,CTXS,VRNT Or CTXS  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Computer   Software stocks are likely familiar with Verint Systems  VRNT  and Citrix Systems  NASDAQ CTXS   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Verint Systems has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Citrix Systems has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that VRNT is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
VRNT currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 64  while CTXS has a forward P E of 22 48  We also note that VRNT has a PEG ratio of 1 05  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  CTXS currently has a PEG ratio of 2 86

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Citrix 
For Citrix  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 64  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Citrix will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Citrix would post earnings of  1 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 21  delivering a surprise of  9 02  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Citrix shares have added about 1 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for Citrix 
While Citrix has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

140578,362093,CTXS,Citrix  CTXS  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Citrix Systems  NASDAQ CTXS  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Citrix is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Citrix  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Citrix
This cloud computing company is expected to earn  5 66 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 0 2  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Citrix  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Citrix will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Citrix would post earnings of  1 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 27  delivering a surprise of  8 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Citrix doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/citrix-systems-ctxs-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200440807,200440807

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cloud computing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 16 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 1  
Revenues are expected to be  708 26 million  up 1 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Citrix 
For Citrix  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Citrix will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Citrix would post earnings of  1 59 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 67  delivering a surprise of  5 03  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times

Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Citrix  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier

140654,362169,CTXS,Citrix Systems Options Pricing In A Bigger Than Usual Earnings Reaction,opinion,"Shares of Citrix Systems  Inc  NASDAQ CTXS  are hovering near breakeven at  102 20 today  as traders gear up for the company s third quarter earnings  which are set for release after the market closes tonight  Below we will take a look at how CTXS has been faring on the charts  and at what the options market has priced in for the stock s post earnings moves 
Long term  CTXS spent most of the past year climbing atop support at the 60 day and 100 day moving averages  with the security touching a record closing high of  114 42 in late August  However  the equity breached this pair of trendlines earlier this month  as Citrix stock slide with the broader stock market  The shares seem to have found a foothold atop the round number century mark  though 

Digging into its earnings history  CTXS closed higher the day after reporting in four of the last eight quarters  including the last three in a row  Looking broader  the shares have averaged a 2 8  move the day after earnings over the last two years  regardless of direction  This time around  CTXS options traders are expecting a much larger than usual 7 0  swing for Thursday s trading 
While absolute options volume runs light on Citrix  the software stock sports a Schaeffer s put call open interest ratio  SOIR  of 1 75  which ranks in the highest percentile of its annual range  In other words  short term speculators are much more put heavy than usual toward CTXS stock ahead of earnings 
In the same pessimistic vein  14 of 17 covering analysts offer up tepid  hold  or worse ratings on the tech name  Plus  short interest accounts for 7 3  of the equity s total available float  and would take about seven days to buy back  at CTXS  average daily trading volume  Should the shares once again pop higher after earnings  a round of analyst upgrades or an exodus of option bears or short sellers could propel the security higher ",2018-10-25,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/citrix-systems-options-pricing-in-a-biggerthanusual-earnings-reaction-200350553,200350553
140655,362170,CTXS,Earnings Preview  Citrix Systems  CTXS  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Citrix Systems  NASDAQ CTXS  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cloud computing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 59 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 2  
Revenues are expected to be  790 31 million  up 1 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Citrix 
For Citrix  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Citrix will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Citrix would post earnings of  1 25 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 40  delivering a surprise of  12  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Citrix doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-citrix-systems-ctxs-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200376237,200376237
140656,362171,CTXS,Six Weeks Of Gains For The Dow And NASDAQ ,opinion,"This week had a little something for everyone  including solid earnings reports  a dovish Fed  happy trade talk and now strong economic data  While the major indices came off their highs by the closing bell  Friday was still a strong enough session for the Dow and NASDAQ to extend their winning streaks to an impressive six weeks 
	The Dow climbed nearly 200 points at its best today and dipped into the red at its worst  It settled with a gain of 0 26   or about 64 points  to 25 063 89  That was good enough for a weekly improvement of 1 3   The S P rose 0 09  to 2706 53 for a five day advance of 1 6  
	However  the NASDAQ couldn t stay on the plus side and finished lower by 0 25  to 7263 87  The index was dragged down a bit by Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   which slipped nearly 5 4  in the session  The retailing giant beat on both the top and bottom lines in its report after the bell yesterday  but its guidance wasn t as strong as the market hoped  Nevertheless  the index still finished the week 1 4  higher 
	The major indices had a much better week than last when the Dow and NASDAQ managed to barely keep their winning runs alive with gains of only about 0 1   while the S P  of course  was slightly negative 
	The economy added 304 000 jobs in January  which crushed expectations for only about 170 000  The December result was revised sharply lower and wage growth was a bit on the soft side  Nevertheless  the market loved the number  especially at a time when the Fed has been talking about being patient with their rate hikes 
	It s been a great week for the market  especially when you consider that it began with a couple lackluster sessions  Now we just need all this backslapping between the U S  and China to result in an actual trade deal

	  Discover  DFS   This big cap credit card   financial company reported a disappointing quarter last week  so the CEO stepped to the plate and bought 30 000 shares as a  confidence buy  
	  Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL   Shares are down more than 10  over the past three months  but that didn t keep a director from adding over 5000 shares earlier this week  Another director bought in December as well 
	  Live Oak Bancshares  LOB   This small cap bank is the risky play  as shares have plunged of late  Also  the government shutdown led to a cut in 2019 estimates  However  a mini cluster buy from three insiders this week suggests that the panic has gone too far and the worst is over  Tracey agrees

140731,362246,CTXS,Tech Rally Ends NASDAQ s 5 Day Slide,opinion,"Now THAT S a session worthy of a strong earnings season  The market has been folding its arms in response to solid quarterly numbers of late  but today each of the major indices jumped by 1  or more amid a tech rebound  
	We can thank good old Facebook  NASDAQ FB  for leading the way on Thursday  as the social media giant hasn t lost a step in the wake of Cambridge Analytica and Mark Zuckerberg s Congressional testimony  After the bell yesterday  the company blew past Zacks Consensus Estimates on both the top and bottom lines  which led to shares jumping more than 9  today  
	Backed up by Facebook  the NASDAQ had no problem ending its five session losing streak on Thursday  It was easily the best performing index of the Big 3 with a surge of 1 64  to 7118 7  Best of all  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  just reported tremendous profit growth after the bell today  so this index and the market in general could have another shot in the arm on Friday that would pave the way for a third straight week of gains  As of this writing  shares of AMZN are up about 6  after hours  
	Meanwhile  the S P was up 1 04  to 2666 9  The Dow ended its own 5 day losing streak yesterday  and today it added another 0 99  to 24 322 3  In addition to the rebound in tech  stocks also benefited from the 10 year Treasury note falling back below 3    Earnings are finally helping the market like they were supposed to  Last week it seemed like everything was getting sold into and it didn t matter what the numbers were  This week we see the fundamentals are moving the stocks via earnings and that is helping the market grind higher   said Jeremy in Counterstrike

Today s Portfolio Highlights  

Technology Innovators  Given today s rally in the tech space  Brian Bolan felt it was time to put some money to work  On Thursday  he picked up Citrix Systems  NASDAQ CTXS   a software name that reported a strong quarter last night  It beat on both the top and bottom lines while also guiding higher for next quarter and the full year  CTXS is still only a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but the editor feels that will improve shortly as the company hits  new highs after new highs   Read the complete commentary for more on this new addition  Momentum Trader  The NASDAQ should recover nicely over the next couple of weeks  according to Dave  So Thursday provided a great opportunity for the editor to add a tech name  He picked up a 12 5  allocation in Mellanox  MLNX   a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  supplier of semiconductor based  interconnect products  Shares are moving toward its 52 week high after a strong quarterly report  and Dave thinks it s ready to break on through to new heights  The full write up has more on this new addition  Surprise Trader  Over the past four quarters  SodaStream  SODA  has put together an average beat of 40 4   Dave expects the streak to continue when it reports again next Wednesday  especially since it has a positive Earnings ESP of more than 6   The editor added SODA on Thursday while also selling Allegheny Tech  ATI  for an approximately 6  profit  See the complete commentary for more on today s moves 

Healthcare Innovators  The portfolio cashed in a couple of profits on Thursday  as Kevin sold Baxter  BAX  and BioTelemetry  BEAT  for returns of nearly 25  and 17   respectively  Both companies had good quarterly reports  but the editor feels he can make bigger profits elsewhere  He thinks BAX will struggle to hold  70  while BEAT is suffering from a lack of enthusiasm in the investment community  By the way  HI also had the top performing stock of the day as Alexion Pharma  ALXN  jumped more than 14 5  after a strong quarter  Options Trader   With the correction lows seemingly behind us  we should soon see the markets stage a real challenge to their all time highs made in January   But the first target for the S P 500 is the 2 750 level  we closed at 2 667 yesterday   Once we can clear that hurdle  descending resistance line that dates back to late January s all time high   I m expecting the pace of this rally to pick up significantly   In spite of the market s rough start at the beginning of the week  stocks have been nothing short of impressive since then  And that s a testament to the underlying bullishness of this historic bull market      Kevin Matras Have a Good Evening Jim Giaquinto

5 Top ROE Picks as Markets Warm Up to Trump Presidency

	The equity market witnessed a sharp fall on Nov 9 after the unexpected victory of Donald Trump as the president of the U S  This sent shockwaves through industries far and wide  rattling the global markets on fears of changes in government policies  However  the markets made a dramatic rebound in the later part of the day on expectations of an economic stimulus that would boost hiring and corporate earnings while cutting taxes 


	Amid such an equivocal scenario  investors are often on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that would enable them to rake in more profits 
	However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  A Key Financial Metric
	ROE   Net Income Shareholders  Equity
	ROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns 
	Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher the better  It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Parameters Used for Screening
	In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we take a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock 

Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  Of course  the higher the ROA  the better it is 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment

5 Stocks to Buy for Remarkable Earnings Growth in 2017

	Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  But the question here is why  This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings 

	Investors should always look out for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price 

Future Outperformers

	Earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates  However  if you pick stocks just on the basis of earnings growth then you are paying for something that has already been reflected in the stock price 

	So  what is earnings acceleration  It is the incremental growth in a company s earnings per share  EPS   In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be called earnings acceleration 

	Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  Sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down  Hence  earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance 

Screening Parameters  

	Let s look for stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rate is also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates 

EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1    The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  

EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2    The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  

EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3   The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3  

	In addition to this  we have added

Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT 

Applied Materials  AMAT  has trended higher since February  Often it is said that stocks like these do not give you a chance to get in  never giving a pullback  But this has been consolidating under resistance since December  Friday saw it move back to the top of resistance with support from a rising RSI in the bullish zone and a MACD that has crossed up  a buy signal  The Bollinger Bands  are squeezing  often a precursor to a move  Look for a push over resistance as your opportunity to participate to the upside   

Citrix Systems  NASDAQ CTXS 

Citrix Systems  CTXS  started higher from a 2 month base in November  That move made a top in early December and pulled back  The price has now rounded out of that pullback and is approaching the prior high  As it does the RSI is in the bullish zone and rising with the MACD about to cross up  Look for a push over resistance to participate to the upside

Up Next  Bonus Idea

Elsewhere look for the bounce in Gold to meet some resistance and possible stall out while Crude Oil churns sideways  The US Dollar Index is poised to continue lower  pulling back in its uptrend  while US Treasuries run the same risk as Gold  finding resistance in the bounce and dropping 
The Shanghai Composite looks to continue to bounce in a tight range mainly sideways as Emerging Markets break to the upside  Volatility looks to remain non existent keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts remain positive with the IWM and SPY in consolidation while the QQQ marches higher  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

The Federal Reserve Federal Open Market Committee is meeting today and tomorrow to determine monetary policy  Fed policymakers have clearly indicated they will raise the overnight benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0 75 percent and 1 00 percent  and may signal there could be  than the three rate rises they have forecast for this year 
While  for markets this week  investors also have to assess the impact of central bank meetings in Britain and Japan  a gathering of G20 finance chiefs  President Trump s first budget and an election in the Netherlands 
The dollar index rose 0 3   Yields on benchmark 10 year German government bonds briefly hit 14 month highs above 0 5   before reversing  Oil fell to 3 1 2 month lows after Saudi Arabia announced it has reversed about one third of its production cuts and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  reported oil stocks were still rising despite agreed output cuts

Small business owner optimism dipped in February but stayed near long time highs  The sentiment gauge from the National Federation of Independent Business fell 0 6 points to 105 3  The stronger economy increasingly seems to come at a price for small business owners  The NFIB wrote in its release   This is one of the tightest labor markets in the 43 year history of the NFIB survey  
FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig rolled out what he called  a comprehensive plan for reforming bank oversight   calling on the biggest lenders to further separate investment banking activities and accept stricter capital requirements in exchange for fewer regulations  It would require large  complex  universal banks to separately capitalize and manage their traditional commercial banking activities and their nontraditional activities  such as investment banking  In other words  a variation on the Glass Steagall Act 
Wall Street seems largely unfazed by political turmoil and uncertainty  The major indices are still very close to record highs  and the VIX  the volatility index  is near long time lows  closing today at 12 23  There are a couple of possible explanations  the global economy has been in recovery mode   a slow  sluggish and boring uptrend 
Per the World Bank  annual global growth since 2011 has hovered in a narrow 2 3 to 3 percent range  The International Monetary Fund s measure pegs it in an even tighter 3 1 to 3 5 percent range since 2012  And if both institutions  estimates are met  2017 will be yet another year of growth being stuck within these narrow parameters  Global company earnings volatility has been low throughout the post crisis recovery   consistently 5 percent or lower over the past five years 
In the past 20 years  there have been only two significant bouts of earnings volatility of 15 percent and higher  or global recessions  They coincided with the market crashes of 2000 02 and 2007 09  The other reason is that in a low interest rate environment investors don t have much alternative  You ride out the risk  So  we have strong data but uncertain politics  and they seem to balance out  at least for now 
Luxury fashion retailer Neiman Marcus Group said it was exploring strategic alternatives  including a sale of the company  The move comes about two months after the company pulled its IPO  Neiman Marcus also reported a 6 1 percent drop in second quarter revenue as issues in its new merchandising and distribution system forced the company to take additional markdowns  Hudson s Bay has emerged as the most prominent suitor

The Trump administration is weighing even deeper cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency than previous versions of their budget outline suggested  In its first budget draft last month  the White House proposed a 25  cut to the EPA budget  But wait there s more  officials are now considering cutting the agency s  8 1 billion budget even further 
The ax looks set to fall hardest on EPA s climate change programs  with the staff there expected to leave the agency  The EPA budget proposal is likely to run into opposition in Congress  and it is already running into opposition from mayors 
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is coordinating the effort with dozens of other cities to purchase up to  10 billion worth of electric vehicles  Thirty cities including New York and Chicago jointly asked automakers for the cost and feasibility of providing 114 000 electric vehicles  including police cruisers  street sweepers and trash haulers  That would be comparable to about 72  of total US plug in vehicle sales last year 
The auto makers have been fighting CAF  rules which set fuel efficiency standards and complaining that there is not enough demand to justify developing more efficient electric vehicles  The mayors say they would like to have more electric vehicles on the streets  including some that haven t been developed yet  such as plug in fire trucks and street sweepers  While the initiative would probably be spread out over several years  it would provide electric vehicle manufacturers reliable demand 
Alphabet s Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt announced today via Twitter that  John Goodenough  inventor of the lithium battery  has developed the first all solid state battery cells   And that is a pretty big deal  Goodenough s batteries reportedly have three times as much energy density as today s lithium ion batteries  They store and transmit energy at temperatures lower than traditional lithium ion packs and can be made using globally abundant supplies of sodium 
The research could result in  a safe  low cost all solid state cell with a huge capacity giving a large energy density and a long cycle life suitable for powering an all electric road vehicle or for storing electric power from wind or solar energy   Goodenough and his team of researchers at the University of Texas have applied for patents on the solid state battery technology and it may be a while till the batteries move to production 
Goodenough is a National Medal of Science laureate  and by the way  he is 94 years old

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Top ROE Stocks to Buy as Earnings Growth Remains Elusive 

We are into the second quarter reporting cycle with corporate earnings hardly showing signs of growth for the S P 500 index  Yet  results are improving sequentially and showing impressive beat ratios  Moreover  the U S  equity market has sustained its Bull Run for the seventh consecutive year with stocks hovering around record high territory 

As investors scout for cherry pickings  they are often on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that would enable them to milk more cash or profits 
	However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  A Key Financial Metric
	ROE   Net Income Shareholders  Equity
	ROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is a useful tool for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify those stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher investor returns instead of piling up cash 
	Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher the better  It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening Parameters
	In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  However  these are not the ultimate criteria for short listing stocks  As such  we have added a few additional criteria to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock 

Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of its assets  which include cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  Of course  the higher the ROA  the better it is 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated to solid cash strength Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
	Here are 5 of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening Macy s  Inc       Based in Cincinnati  OH  Macy s is one of the leading department store retailers in the U S   operating approximately 870 stores under the names of Macy s  Bloomingdale s  Bloomingdale s Outlet  Macy s Backstage and Bluemercury  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock has a decent long term earnings growth expectation of 8 5  and a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 3 9  General Mills  Inc       Based in Minneapolis  MN  General Mills is a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores  The company also serves the foodservice and commercial baking industries  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a healthy long term earnings growth expectation of 7 8  and a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 7 3  Zoetis Inc       Founded in 1952 and headquartered in Florham Park  NJ  Zoetis manufactures and markets veterinary vaccines  medicines  diagnostic products and related services for livestock and companion animals across the globe  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock has a solid long term earnings growth expectation of 12 6  and a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 16 4  Boston Scientific Corporation      Headquartered in Natick  MA and founded in 1979  Boston Scientific manufactures medical devices and products used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 6 3  and long term earnings growth expectation of 10 7  Citrix Systems  Inc       Headquartered in Fort Lauderdale  FL  Citrix offers an integrated portfolio of Workspace as a Service  application delivery  virtualization  mobility  network delivery and file sharing solutions  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a solid long term earnings growth expectation of 12 2  and a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 29 0

Buy These 5 Stocks with Superb Earnings Acceleration

	Since we are in the thick of the earnings season  investors should look for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Better than expected earnings results mostly lead to an uptick in the share price  Earnings growth  moreover  enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  But the question here is why  This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Notably  earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time 

	Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement 

Spotting Future Outperformers

	Earnings acceleration is nothing but incrementally growing earnings per share  EPS  of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases over a considerable period  it is termed as earnings acceleration 

	If you pick a stock just by focusing on the company s earnings growth trajectory then you are paying for something that has already been reflected in the stock price  Earnings acceleration  on the other hand  considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates  This helps you in picking stocks that are yet to gain significant attention from investors  and consequently a solid price increase is still in the cards 

	Increase in the percentage of earnings growth convinces us about the fundamental soundness of the company  A sideways percentage of earnings growth  on the other hand  indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  If the earnings growth percentage moderates  share prices are more likely to nosedive 

	Hence  earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance 

The Winning Strategy

	Let s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates 

EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1    The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  

EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2    The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  

EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3    The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3  

	In addition to this  we have added the following parameters 

Current Price greater than or equal to  5   This screens out the low priced stocks 

Average 20 day volume greater than or equal to 50 000   High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 

	The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7 735 stocks to only 28  Here are the top five stocks 

Lancaster Colony Corporation  NASDAQ      manufactures and markets specialty food products for the retail and foodservice markets in the United States  The company s estimated earnings growth rate for this year is 5 3

140849,362364,CTXS,6 GARP Stocks Poised To Yield Healthy Returns,opinion,"Those who are interested in building up a portfolio that can provide healthy returns by investing in undervalued stocks with a strong growth prospect may consider growth at a reasonable price  or GARP investing  However  one should not confuse it with a blend strategy  While the blend strategy chooses value and growth stocks  GARP investing looks for stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing 
So when the market is rebounding strongly after bleeding or staying stable over a prolonged time period  investing in stocks by following the GARP strategy should boost one s portfolio returns 
Key Features of GARP
The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by borrowing the best features of both value and growth investing  While investors following the GARP strategy give precedence to value ratios such as price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratio  they also use earnings per share  EPS  growth rates and return on equity  ROE  like growth investors to identify potential stocks  However  the range of the values of metrics that are considered by GARP investing may differ from those that are considered by value or growth investors 
While value investors look for an extremely low P E ratio to choose a company  the GARP strategy focuses on acquiring stocks that have relatively higher ratios but less than their respective industry average  Meanwhile  GARP investing chooses stocks with P B ratios lower than their industries similar to value investors  
Separately  investors following the GARP strategy give priority to stocks with an impressive EPS growth track record over those with extremely high growth rates  Companies that qualify GARP investing are believed to have 10  to 20  past as well as expected growth rates over the next few years 
Another metric  which is borrowed by GARP investors from growth investing  is return on equity  ROE   Like growth investors  the GARP strategy looks for stocks with higher ROE than their industry average 
Screening Parameters
Along with the criteria we discussed in the above section  we have also considered a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy    to make the strategy more profitable 
  Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  
  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  
  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  
  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  
Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only six 
Here are the stocks that made it through the screen

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks to Buy with High ROE as Earnings Bells Chime 

The U S  equity market is presently hovering around record high territory buoyed by better than expected performance of companies that have reported so far  This has lured investors back to the equity markets from safe haven assets like government bond and gold 

As investors scout for cherry pickings  they are often on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that would enable them to milk more cash or profits 
	However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  A Key Financial Metric
	ROE   Net Income Shareholders  Equity
	ROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is a useful tool for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify those stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher investor returns instead of piling up the dry powder 
	Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher the better  It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Parameters Used for Screening
	In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and  ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  However  these are not the ultimate criteria for short listing stocks  As such  we have added a few additional criteria to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock 

Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of its assets  which include cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  Of course  the higher the ROA  the better it is 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated to solid cash strength Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
	Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening Altria Group  Inc       Headquartered in Richmond  VA  Altria manufactures and sells cigarettes  smokeless products  and wine through its subsidiaries  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock has a healthy long term earnings growth expectation of 7 4  The Priceline Group Inc       Norwalk  CT based Priceline is one of the largest online travel companies in the world  The company s travel related offerings cover hotel rooms  airline tickets  rental cars  vacation packages and cruises  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a healthy long term earnings growth expectation of 18 1  and a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 4 7  Zoetis Inc       Founded in 1952 and headquartered in Florham Park  NJ  Zoetis manufactures and markets veterinary vaccines  medicines  diagnostic products and related services for livestock and companion animals across the globe  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a solid long term earnings growth expectation of 12 6  and a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 16 4  Gilead Sciences Inc       Headquartered in Foster City  CA  Gilead Sciences is a biopharmaceutical company  focused on developing drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus  HIV   liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus  HCV  infection and chronic hepatitis B virus  HBV  infection  cardiovascular  hematology oncology and inflammation respiratory diseases  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 6 4  Citrix Systems  Inc       Headquartered in Fort Lauderdale  FL  Citrix offers an integrated portfolio of Workspace as a Service  application delivery  virtualization  mobility  network delivery and file sharing solutions  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a solid long term earnings growth expectation of 12 2  and a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 36 6

140860,362375,CTXS,SAP Forges Ahead With Product Launches  Will It Help ,opinion,"Riding high on its strong cloud business  enterprise application provider SAP SE  DE SAPG    TO SAP   recently came up with two new cloud offerings  SAP Hybris Service Engagement Center and SAP Geographical Enablement Framework 
This came close on the heels of a string of launches last week at the SAPinsider  where the company rolled out products like SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance  SAP HANA smart data integration  SAP HANA smart data quality  SAP Data Services  SAP Information Steward software and the SAP Agile Data Preparation application 
Product Details
SAP Hybris Service Engagement Center  This is an omnichannel cloud customer engagement solution that will aid clients to deliver contextual and relevant service experiences regardless of channel or device  This offering further expands the company s service solutions in the SAP Hybris portfolio and will help organizations in combining unassisted and assisted service with digital commerce during and after the buying process 
The company believes this solution will take call centers to the next level by resolving issues stemming from the ongoing proliferation of interaction channels and customer touch points  Notable benefits would include higher agent productivity  accelerated online buying decisions  lower return rates and reduction of operational costs 
SAP Geographical Enablement Framework  This offering will help business enterprises supplement business applications with geographic data from geographic information systems  GIS   such as Esri ArcGIS  Also  continuous collaboration between SAP and Esri will help clients to obtain contextual insight from business and spatial data  In addition  this can also be used in conjunction with SAP BusinessObjects Cloud and SAP BusinessObjects Lumira software to enrich data with geographic information and map visualizations 
Strong HeadwindsDespite the product launches and thriving cloud business  SAP s prospects looks murky  A host of factors like stiff competition in the IT services industry  persistent weakness in multiple end markets like Latin America and Brazil along with escalating research and development expenses pose significant headwinds  Also  there is an inherent seasonality in client s technology spending  which exposes the company s sales to risks of quarterly fluctuations SAP AG ADR Price
   As a matter of fact  earnings estimates of the company have been going down prior to its second quarter results   Over the past 30 days  brokers have revised earnings estimates downward from  3 61 to  3 52  reflecting a bearish outlook  In addition  inherent seasonality in technology spending has largely hurt this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company s software revenues and may continue to do so in the to be reported quarter

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks GARP Investors Would Love to Buy 

An investment strategy that seeks to provide impressive returns from stocks that are undervalued on the one hand and have a solid growth potential on the other  has always attracted attention  Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is one of the popular strategies in this domain  Instead of picking both value and growth stocks like the blend strategy does  GARP looks for stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing 

GARP Strategy in Detail

Though investors following GARP consider popular metrics of both value and growth investing  the ideal range of these metrics is different from what is considered by value and growth investing  GARP investing employs popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratio   to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued or not 

In case of P E ratio  investors following the GARP strategy look for a higher value of the ratio compared to value investors  However  they avoid picking companies with extremely high price to earnings ratios  On the other hand  like value investors  GARP investors give precedence to low P B ratios  A ratio less than the industry average is preferred by GARP investors for choosing undervalued stocks 

The other metrics that are borrowed by GARP investors from the growth investing strategy are strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects for the coming years  Unlike growth investors  GARP investors look for stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate instead of choosing those with extremely high growth rates  Growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal in GARP strategy 

Return on equity  ROE  is another growth metric used in GARP strategy  Here  those stocks that have higher ROE compared to the industry average are considered as strong ROE is an indicator of superior stocks 

In order to make GARP strategy more profitable  we have only considered those with a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or Zacks Rank  2  Buy  

Screening Parameters

  Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2
	 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  

  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20  
	 Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  

  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average 
	 Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  

  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average 
	 P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  

The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 8 

Here are five stocks from the eight that made it through the screen 

Citrix Systems  Inc     is one of the leading suppliers of application delivery and management software and services  This Zacks Rank  1 has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 36 6

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Invest in These Top 5 ROE Stocks to Avert Capital Flight 

Equity markets across the globe witnessed a bloodbath last Friday due to the Brexit referendum  As the news spread like a wildfire  about  2 1 trillion of investor wealth was wiped out from the global markets   reportedly the heaviest suffered in a single market day 
	Though the markets have bounced back  the situation still remains volatile  where money can play a key role in surviving carnage  So  investors are often on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks to milk more cash or profits to avert capital flight 
	However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  An Effective Tool
	ROE   Net Income Shareholders  Equity
	ROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is a useful tool for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify those stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher investor returns instead of piling up the dry powder 
	Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher the better  It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening Parameters for Solid ROE Stocks
	In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  However  these are not the ultimate criteria for short listing stocks in a turbulent market  As such  we have added a few additional criteria to arrive at a winning strategy to mint money Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of its assets  which include cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  Of course  the higher the ROA  the better it is 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated to solid cash strength Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
	Here are 5 of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening Altria Group  Inc      Headquartered in Richmond  VA  Altria manufactures and sells cigarettes  smokeless products  and wine through its subsidiaries  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock has a healthy long term earnings growth expectation of 7 5  Braskem S A      Headquartered in S o Paulo  Brazil  Braskem has the largest petrochemical operation in Latin America  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock is the leading thermoplastic resins  polyethylene  polypropylene and PVC  producer in the Americas and the largest producer of polypropylene in the U S Zoetis Inc      Founded in 1952 and headquartered in Florham Park  NJ  Zoetis manufactures and markets veterinary vaccines  medicines  diagnostic products and related services for livestock and companion animals across the globe  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a solid long term earnings growth expectation of 12 6  and a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 16 4  Mobile TeleSystems PJSC     This Zacks Rank  1 stock offers telecommunication services like wireless Internet access and fixed voice  broadband and pay TV to over 100 million customers in Russia  Central and Eastern Europe Citrix Systems  Inc      Headquartered in Fort Lauderdale  FL  Citrix offers an integrated portfolio of Workspace as a Service  application delivery  virtualization  mobility  network delivery and file sharing solutions  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a solid long term earnings growth expectation of 12 2  and a trailing four quarter average earnings surprise of 36 6

140872,362387,CTXS,5 Tech Stocks To Watch Out For In The Second Half Of The Year,opinion,The first half of 2016 was rather tumultuous for investors  The slowdown in the Chinese economy coupled with sliding oil prices set off alarm bells every now and then at all the major domestic indexes  fueling concerns of a global economic slowdown Also  in March  the Federal Reserve backtracked on its decision to hike rates four times a year to two times in 2016 statin that  global and financial developments continue to pose risks   thereby failing to allay investors  concerns However  in a meeting held in mid June  the Fed didn t hike rates as a weak jobs report for May  a low level of business investment and lower than expected inflation wasn t conducive to a rate hike  For the time being  interest rates continue to stay between 0 25  and 0 50  Finally  shocking  Brexit  results  whereby the people of Britain chose to leave the 28 nation European Union  led the equity markets across the globe  including the U S  to a massive sell off  wiping out nearly  3 trillion dollars  Prior to the referendum held on Jun 24  most of the poll results were in favor of  Bremain  but the actual results came in favor of  Brexit  by a slight margin  While the  Leave  vote share was 51 9   votes to  Remain  in the EU came in marginally below at 48 1   Following the results  British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he would step down by October  The Fed chairperson had earlier added at the FOMC meeting that the  Brexit  scenario was likely to have  consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets  What Lies Ahead It seems that markets have started to shrug off the overblown fears of Brexit  Last week  the S P 500  NASDAQ composite and Dow Jones industrial average closed in the green  reverting most of the Brexit losses  The S P 500 was up 4 3   NASDAQ composite was up 4 4  and DJIA was up 4 2   given the recent encouraging pool of economic data  This signals further growth for the domestic economy in the latter half of the year Data for the month of June on private sector jobs  manufacturing and consumer spending was encouraging  Also  the  third  estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that first quarter output of goods and services increased at an annual rate of 1 1   higher than the consensus estimate of a 1  increase  In addition  relatively lower gas prices will give Americans the freedom to spend more on discretionary activities  thus boding well for the economy Tech Sector Performance Volatility has had its fair share of impact on the technology sector  Year to date  the S P North American Technology Sector Index is down 0 2  as against a gain of 2 9  for the S P 500  However  we believe that it is too early to call out the sector now because the stronger season is typically in the back half of the year and there are other catalysts that can increase technology spending very rapidly  Also  the buzz surrounding cloud computing  AR  VR and AI technology keeps investors  interest in the sector alive  It s also important to note that tech companies have huge cash balances that should help in facilitating organic and inorganic expansion Tech Stocks to Pick for the Second HalfNow that the first half of 2016 has come to an end  let s not sulk over opportunities lost  By using our Zacks Stocks Screener  we bring forth five such stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that promise better returns  on an average  than the individual components  as it considers three times as many items that are correlated to future stock returns Arista Networks  Inc   NYSE ANET    Headquartered in Santa Clara  CA  Arista Networks offers cloud

140899,362414,CTXS,Bonus Trade Idea  Week Of August 24  2015,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Citrix Systems  NASDAQ CTXS  is probably most well known for their product  GoToMeeting  a service that allows on line meetings with colleagues and clients  Everyone has used it  But the company offers a full line of virtualization  mobility management and networking solutions 
The stock had started moving higher in April  eventually retesting the September 2014 high  A slight pullback created a Cup and Handle pattern  and this is still in place with a target of 89 50  But the price pulled back hard to end last week 
The RSI pulled back hard to as momentum shifted to the downside  while the MACD crossed down and fell  The RSI is still in the bullish range  but with more downside in the market  this may be one stock that will catch up 
There is support at 73 and 71 followed by 68 25 before 67 40 and a gap to fill to 66 then 64 25  Resistance above may come at 74 80 and 77 25 followed by 78 30  Short interest is low under 2  and the company is expected to report earnings next October 21st 
Looking at the options chains  the September set shows big open interest on the Call side from 65 to 80  On the Put side  the biggest open interest is at the 67 5 and 62 5 Strikes  There is minimal activity in outer months at this point 
Citrix Systems
Trade Idea 1  Sell the stock short on a continuation lower  under 73 91  with a stop at 75  A straight stock trade with stop loss to manage risk 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the September 75 Puts  offered at  3 00 late Friday   A controlled risk way to participate in the downside 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the September 72 5 70 Put Spread   1 20   Adds leverage to the short defined risk trade 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the September 72 5 70 Put Spread and sell the September 80 Call  80 cents   Adds more leverage and upside risk above the large open interest at 80 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the last full week of August sees the Equity markets looking horrible  ready for more downside 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue in its uptrend while crude oil continues lower  The US dollar index is consolidating sideways with a downward bias  while US Treasuries are biased higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside with risk of the Chinese market running sideways in consolidation 
Volatility looks to remain elevated above the prior stable period  but usually does not hold these levels long  This will keep the bias lower for the equity index ETF s NYSE SPY  NYSE IWM and NASDAQ QQQ in the short run  Their charts suggest the downside move is not over  but all are very oversold and could see short term bounces early in the week  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Information Technology   Communications Equipment   Reports May 18  After Market Closes
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus on  is looking for earnings of 56 cents per shares on  11 96 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  50 million on the top 
Cisco has positioned itself towards high growth sectors such as cloud computing and cyber security in an effort to become a diversified provider of networking solutions
Some risks to earnings include intensifying competition and the persisting slowdown in China 
Results for Cisco s fiscal third quarter are scheduled to be announced this Wednesday  after the market closes  The networking giant is coming off a better than expected second quarter where it beat by 2 cents on the bottom and almost  100 million on the top  Despite macroeconomic uncertainty  Cisco saw an increase in all key financial metrics  Improving markets for its products on top of solid growth in areas like cloud computing and security should continue to boost earnings moving forward  The stock  on the other hand  has moved in the other direction  and is down over 10  from a year earlier 
In its Q2 analyst call  Cisco issued guidance of 1 4  revenue growth for the third quarter  This comes in slightly higher than the Estimize consensus which is expecting revenue to decline 1  to  11 96 billion  The same consensus is looking for earnings of 56 cents per share  reflecting a 4  gain from a year earlier  Unfortunately  the stock typically doesn t move during earnings season  so investors don t have a chance to reconcile their losses of the past 12 months 

Cisco s transition towards high growth sectors such as cloud computing and cyber security are starting to pay off  The company has and will continue to use acquisitions to leverage more market share in these spaces  Moreover  as network spending improves  Cisco should benefit from a rapid rise in bandwidth consumption  high demand for data centers and increased adoption of its cloud networking 
Cisco saw weakness in its fast growing data center segment last quarter but expects that to be a temporary issue  Meanwhile  security has posted robust growth quarter after quarter  The second quarter featured double digit gains in revenue from security products  Cisco s aim to become a diversified provider of all networking solutions should bode well moving forward
In the meantime  Cisco continues to see increased competition from smaller startups and established tech companies  including IBM  NYSE IBM   Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR   Citrix  NASDAQ CTXS  and even Amazon Web Services  NASDAQ AMZN   China has also posed a problem for Cisco where it generates about  2 billion in revenue  Last quarter  the network giant saw orders in China decline nearly 20   as a weakness in the region persists ",2016-05-18,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/don’t-get-caught-with-this-tech-giant-in-your-portfolio-200130560,200130560
