the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that

Co  Ltd    NYSE TSM   5 Stocks with Recent Price Strength for a Solid PortfolioWall Street is firing on all cylinders since the beginning of this year  breaking one record after another  It seems that the bulls have no intention of taking a breather after completing the best year in the last six years  This year s momentum starts from where it ended in 2019 Notably  in the first 12 trading days of this year  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite scored fresh closing highs half of the time  During these days  the Dow  the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite surpassed the respective key technical barriers of 29 000  3 300 and 9 000 For the week ended Jan 17  all three major indexes posted their largest percentage gains since the week ended Aug 30  2018  The Dow finished in the positive territory in five of the past six weeks  the S P 500 ended in the green for two successive weeks and the Nasdaq Composite maintained its winning streak for six straight weeks At this stage  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds good  Here s how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities

1475,222990,EBMT,Zacks com Highlights  GP Strategies  Arkema SA  Commercial Vehicle Group  MasTec And Eagle Bancorp Montana,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Jan 31  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  GP Strategies Corporation   NYSE GPX    Arkema SA   OTC ARKAY    Commercial Vehicle Group Inc    NASDAQ CVGI    MasTec Inc    NYSE MTZ   and Eagle Bancorp Montana  Inc    NASDAQ EBMT   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Solid Stocks with Impressive Net Profit MarginInvestors rely on net profit margin to pick stocks that ensure maximum returns from the portfolio  Net profit margin is the most effective way to measure a company s profitability  A proper analysis of the same reveals how well a company is run and the headwinds confronting it A higher net margin reflects a company s efficiency at converting sales into actual profits Net Profit Margin  Net profit  Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers lends the company a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective to analyze a company s performance And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list

Medium to Long Term Impact 
Bet Big on Infrastructure   Utility

Regional Banks to Perform Better 
Historically  financial stocks have performed better with republicans in the White House thanks to their   However  since Trump intends to  the big banks  commercial and investment banking arms  it is better to tilt toward smaller scale regional banks  So  SPDR S P Regional Banking ETF  could be a lucrative choice

1491,223006,EBMT,5 Stocks To Buy As Trump Raises Hopes For Banking Sector,opinion,Bank stocks  in recent years  have been held back by heavy regulation and low interest rates  But  optimism surrounding the sector s outlook is growing  thanks to Donald Trump s victory Trump s intention to roll back regulations and lower administrative burden will stand in good stead for the banking industry  Tax reforms and uptick in infrastructure outlays  then again  will spur a rate hike  There are other positives as well  Trading revenues will get a boost from heightened uncertainty surrounding Trump s victory  Taking such positives into consideration  it will be prudent to invest in fundamentally sound banking companies Roll Back RegulationsInvestors continue to turn toward banks as regulatory burden is likely to ease under Trump s administration and Republican controlled congress  One such change will be the raising of the minimum asset threshold for banking behemoths to  250 billion from  50 billion  which will lend more flexibility  boost valuations  strengthen consolidation and increase lending  Regulations related to bank capital may be relaxed  with capital ratios for regional banks not expected to exceed 12   while the ratio may be slightly higher for bigger lenders Trump  in the meantime  views the Dodd Frank regulatory overhaul as a harsh measure  especially  on smaller banks  Trump has called for repealing parts of the Dodd Frank Act  which has for a considerable period of time limited operational flexibility  Trump s team is also focusing on scaling back the Financial Stability Oversight Council  which serves as a watchdog on big players in the economy  They also want to fix a section of Dodd Frank Title II that has given financial regulators the right to take over a failing financial firm and liquidate it  At the same time  the Trump administration is expected to embrace encouraging aspects of the law such as regulating derivative products and transparency of credit rating agencies Tax Cuts  Rise in SpendingTrump s pledge to slash taxes and increase government spending will fuel inflation  Prices of bonds tanked as inflation mostly erodes the value of securities with a fixed rate income stream   This in turn reached the 10 year treasury yield to its highest level since January  Higher longer term interest rates can boost bank profits  as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities Trump called for sweeping reductions in personal income tax along with trimming the business tax rate from 35  to 15   Corporates will also get a chance to repatriate foreign profits at a rate of 10  Trump is in favor of beefing up public spending by hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure  He said that he will support more spending on transportation and telecommunications infrastructure  clean water and electricity transmission in order to accelerate economic growth  This in turn will create plenty of jobs in construction and manufacturing In fact  he is expected to offer  in tax credits to private construction companies undertaking infrastructure projects In his victory speech  Trump said   We are going to fix our inner cities  and rebuild our highways  bridges  tunnels  airports  schools  hospitals  We re going to rebuild our infrastructure  and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it  Heightened Volatility Boosts TradingThere s a lot of uncertainty about what a Trump presidency means for the U S  economy over the medium and long term  Such uncertainty is expected to benefit banks by boosting its trading revenues from fixed income  currency and commodities segments Gold prices are moving north  U S  Treasury yields are leading a global bond rally while the Mexican peso registered a massive slump on Trump concerns  Trump s win has hit Mexican assets hard after some of his pledges were viewed as a threat to the Mexican economy Top 5 Bank Stocks to Buy NowBanks are poised to reap huge benefits from lighter regulations and rising interest rates under Trump s presidency
