7232,228747,DELL,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Microsoft  Intel  Lenovo  HP And Dell Technologies,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 15  2020   Zacks com announces the list of

include  Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    Intel   NASDAQ INTC    Lenovo   OTC LNVGY    HP   NYSE HPQ   and Dell Technologies   NYSE DELL   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  PC Shipment Scripts Success in Q4  Tech Stocks in FocusThe worldwide PC market maintained its bull run in the fourth quarter of 2019  courtesy of the companies transitioning to Microsoft s latest Windows 10 software  This is further evident from the recently released worldwide PC shipment statistics by Gartner Inc  and International Data Corporation Per Gartner s preliminary   PC shipments in the fourth quarter inched up 2 3  year over year to 70 6 million units Gartner added that for the first time since 2011  the PC market experienced growth  backed by robust business demand for Microsoft s Windows 10 upgrades  particularly in the United States  EMEA and Japan  PC shipments surpassed 261 million units in 2019  reflecting 0 6  growth from the figure reported in 2018  The firm believes that shipments would have risen further had there been no Intel CPU shortages  which is a big issue for the company s PC delivery to its enterprise customers Going by the IDC   shipment rose 4 8  on a year over year basis and totaled 71 8 million in the period under review  The firm added that it is the highest single quarter shipment volume achieved since the fourth quarter of 2015  Additionally  global shipments were up 2 7  year over year in 2019  the first full year PC growth recorded since the market scaled up 1 7  in 2011  the firm notes Per IDC  the adoption of AMD CPUs  easing trade tensions and other industry drivers helped boost the market upsurge this holiday season According to both IDC and Gartner  Lenovo  HP and Dell Technologies were the top three vendors  grabbing a combined 65  market share How Are the Vendors Placed Lenovo has been benefiting immensely from its joint venture with Fujitsu  This China based company regained its top berth in the reported quarter with nearly 24 8  market share per Gartner and IDC HP retained the second spot with 23 9  market share per IDC and 22 8  per Gartner  The company s focus on product innovation   differentiation  pricing plus marketing and sales activities is yielding results  which is evident from its strength across all key geographies  The company s shipments grew consecutively for the third quarter  keeping its leading status intact in the United States  EMEA and Latin America  added Gartner  Withstanding the CPU crunch  the company expanded its market share to 23 6  in 2019  up from 23 1  in 2018  Dell  which held the third position  saw the eighth consecutive quarter of PC shipment flourish in the fourth quarter  Healthy gaming business coupled with strong commercial centric products portfolio is a boon  The company with 17 4  market share witnessed the maximum growth rate of 10 7  among all PC vendors  going by IDC The Way ForwardThe outlook for the PC market is increasingly unpredictable due to the ongoing U S  China trade war and the imposition of additional tariffs  Moreover  with the passage of Window s 10 replacement cycle in January 2020  demand from the business circle is anticipated to weaken  thereby making us apprehensive However  Gartner is positive that even after the passage of Windows 7 support this month  growth will continue throughout this year as many businesses in the emerging regions  such as China  Eurasia and the Asia Pacific have not yet shifted to the Windows 10 mode IDC is hopeful about the growing uptake of new technologies  namely 5G and the dual  and folding screen devices as well as the gaming PCs  However  the firm warns that these will take some time to coalesce All these factors cause concerns not just for the PC vendors but also the players dependent on the same Currently  HP and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  while Dell has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   Lenovo carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong

9524,231039,DELL,5 Top Ranked Stocks With Strong Sales Growth To Buy Now,opinion,With the commencement of third quarter earnings  investors are picking stocks based on earnings strength  However  while it is easy to manipulate the bottom line through cost cutting measures  sales growth comes in handy in gauging a company s future financial performance Top line is the vital parameter for understanding a company s health and ability to sustain its business  It provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  The main advantage is that sales figures are generally not manipulated and are less volatile than earnings Sales growth is a key measure for any company  as it is important for earnings projections and strategic decision making  Without top line growth  bottom line improvement may not be sustainable in the long term Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  Hence  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy P S Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 21 stocks that qualified the screening     Williams Sonoma  Inc    NYSE WSM    based in San Francisco  CA  operates as a multi channel specialty retailer of various

Investors liked the restructured Dell  sending its shares higher by 50  until late May this year  But its shares have been on a downward spiral since then  as the company reported sales for Q1 that fell short of Wall Street estimates  with weaker demand for its servers  The stock closed about 7  down on Friday at  45 81 
Perhaps adding to the company s woes  Dell s business in China generates a high single digit percentage of the company s total revenue  Some customers in the country were delaying orders because of the U S  China trade war  according to Dell s chief financial officer Tom Sweet 
2  Best Buy Best Buy  Co Inc  NYSE BBY  is another high profile name that will come under investor scrutiny this coming week  The big box electronics and technology retailer reports Q2 earnings on Thursday  Aug  29  before the market opens 




The stock has rallied strongly this year  surging more than 25   as Best Buy benefits from its expanding services business and its increasing assortment of smart home devices  such as door locks and cameras  along with appliances  video games and wearable devices  Shares closed at  66 21 on Friday 
That growth momentum may come under pressure  however  with Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   the company s largest supplier  predicting a slowdown in sales this year and the U S   China tariff tit for tat escalating yet again  pushing the cost of electronic products higher  Best Buy relies heavily on China to source its large inventory of products  That could mean more pressure on retailers earnings and shares 
For the second quarter of 2019  the company is likely to report EPS of  0 99  up from  0 91 a year ago  Revenue is likely to rise  9 79 billion according to analyst estimates 
3  TeslaTesla Inc  NASDAQ TSLA  continues to keep investors on edge as a flurry of bad news hit the stock last week  Shares plunged 5  on Friday  falling to  211 40  adding to the 19  plunge during the past one month alone 




On Friday  Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  said a June 2018 blaze on the roof of one of its warehouses in Redlands  California  involved a solar panel system that Tesla s SolarCity division had installed  News of the Amazon fire comes just three days after Walmart  NYSE WMT  filed a lawsuit against Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   accusing it of faulty panel installations that led to fires at more than a half dozen stores 
These claims put further pressure on Elon Musk who s facing increasing criticism over his decisions and the bad financial situation at Tesla s electric car division  In the second quarter  Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  lost  1 12 a share  a bigger deficit than any analyst had projected 
The earnings miss and departures of top executives  are making investors nervous about Musk s ability to turn this company profitable ",2019-08-25,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-watch-in-the-coming-week-dell-best-buy-tesla-200458287,200458287

9550,231065,DELL,No Surprise As ECB Cuts Rates  But Positive Trump Trade Tweet Sounds Promising,opinion," Thursday Market Open  A couple of surprises and one event that was anything but a surprise dominate the news early Thursday after the market came within 1  of all time highs a day ago 
The surprises included Oracle  NYSE ORCL  announcing earnings a day early  see more below  and President Trump tweeting that new tariffs on China would be delayed two weeks in what he called a  gesture of goodwill   Stock futures seemed to get a lift from the trade announcement  especially coming after yesterday s news that China would exempt some U S  products from its tariff list 
In what had to be one of the more widely anticipated moves in recent history  the European Central Bank  ECB  probably surprised few if anyone today when it lowered its deposit rate by 10 basis points and announced new quantitative easing  QE   Under the new QE  the ECB will make 20 billion euros a month of asset purchases basically for as long as it sees necessary to stimulate Europe s tepid economy 
It s hard to get too excited about the ECB s announcement when you consider that past QE programs and rate cuts didn t appear to do too much to help things over there  It s also not necessarily the best news for U S  multinational companies  because it could strengthen the dollar and make U S  products more expensive overseas  The dollar index climbed back toward 99 early Thursday and the euro fell below  1 10  That s near its low for the year  
The news also appeared to give the U S  bond market a boost  with 10 year yields here falling back below 1 7   The thinking could be that as rates in Europe fall  more demand could emerge for U S  Treasuries  
Meanwhile  crude prices eased slightly after a Saudi official said at OPEC s meeting that any formal decision on deeper crude production cuts would have to wait until the December meeting  This was also a bit of a surprise  because many analysts had expected deeper cuts to be announced this week 
On the list of  un surprises  today  the U S  Consumer Price Index  CPI  for August rose 0 1   in line with Wall Street s expectations  The core reading  which strips out food and energy  rose 0 3   Headline CPI is up 1 7  year over year  down from 1 8  in July  but core rose slightly to 2 4  year over year  vs  2 2  in July  Those core numbers for both CPI and producer prices are worth watching next month to see if they keep creeping up  It could be a sign of tariffs starting to add costs for wholesalers 
Round Number DayIf you like nice round numbers  Wednesday was your day  The S P 500  SPX  finished right at 3000  climbing back there for the first time in more than a month  The index is now up more than 6  from its August low  and not far from all time highs posted in July Meanwhile  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  posted its sixth straight higher close and finished above 27 000 for the first time since July The rotation into value and small cap stocks that dominated the first part of the week continued Wednesday  with the small cap Russell 2000  RUT  out performing the SPX  Volatility has been creeping into the bond market lately  and that might be helping steer some investors into what they see as more stable stocks that also have yield  This pattern could continue until we get some clarity from what is going on with interest rates Some analysts are saying the bond rally became a bubble last month and now it s popped  That s one theory  but it s really too soon for a complete diagnosis  With rates still under water in Europe and the Fed widely expected to cut rates next week  it seems a bit hasty to say bonds couldn t bounce back  We ll have to wait and see Infrastructure Boost 
Other analysts looked at the action in stocks recently and wondered if it might reflect more than hopes of Fed easing  Monetary policy can only take the economy so far  considering rates are already quite low historically  That means some investors might be betting on fiscal stimulus of some kind  Remember all that talk about possible infrastructure spending  Well  look at some of the sub sectors performing well lately  Steel and aluminum makers  cement makers  refiners  trucking and railroad companies  It s like a recipe for new infrastructure  but there s no guarantee we ll get it 
Even Boeing  NYSE BA  shares have been on a roll lately  despite all the fundamental issues they re having  This could speak to some investors potentially hoping for new defense related government spending 
The move to so called  value  stocks is even something you can observe in the Technology space  which isn t an area usually associated with value  Stocks like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Intel  NASDAQ INTC   and Dell  NYSE DELL  have been on the upswing lately  These are established firms  some of which pay dividends  FAANGs  on the other hand  have kind of flat lined lately  aside from AAPL   
The caution areas of the market that roared in August came back to earth this week  with gold and bonds under pressure  Utilities had a nice pop Wednesday  but Real Estate was a losing sector  It was interesting to see Health Care have one of the best days of any sector yesterday  helped by strength in Merck  MRK   The rally in MRK might have been some people trying to get in at lower prices after a sell off earlier this week  
Health Care is one of the weaker sectors this year as worries continue to dog medical and health insurance companies about possible U S  government action on prices  This pressure might get worse as next year s election approaches and both parties potentially take a hard line against rising drug costs 
Oracle  NYSE ORCL  Arrives Early
If you look forward to the latest earnings news  it s been kind of a dry period  That changed after Oracle  NYSE ORCL  released earnings a day early following Wednesday s surprise announcement that co CEO Mark Hurd is taking a health related leave of absence  News reports didn t go into more detail about his health 
ORCL reported earnings per share of  0 81  up from  0 71 in the prior year period  and in line with third party consensus expectations  on revenue of  9 2 billion  Revenue missed analysts  average expectation of  9 29 billion  and guidance for Q2 was below the average Wall Street estimate  On the plus side  the company s cloud ERP business grew 33   Shares were down over 2  in pre market trading  
There continue to be concerns about the company s slowing revenue growth  Research firm CFRA says it sees ORCL s revenue falling 2  a year through fiscal 2021 before flattening in fiscal 2022  The firm also notes that ORCL is losing share to faster growing cloud competitors  The question is arguably whether ORCL can keep squeezing out earnings per share growth amid flattening revenue  
Oracle  NYSE ORCL  is part of the Technology sector  and that means overseas economic growth could be a concern for ORCL and other companies in the space  Technology has the highest international revenue exposure of all 11 sectors  according to research firm FactSet  with 57  of revenue coming from overseas  That puts companies like ORCL in the middle of the trade battles not only with China  but also potentially with Europe  Canada  and Mexico as the U S  skirmishes with all those trading partners

FIGURE 1  RALLY MAKES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS  Here s something you don t always see  Both semiconductor stocks  SOX candlestick  and small caps  RUT purple line  are among the leaders in this week s rally  Both had been under pressure last month  Data Sources  Nasdaq  FTSE Russell  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results  
Celebrating at the 50 Yard Line  You know that football expression about not celebrating at the one yard line  We re probably at the trade equivalent of midfield when it comes to a U S  China tariff resolution  but the way the 10 year Treasury yield shot up this week to above 1 7  from lows below 1 5  last month  you might think some investors see trade as a done deal and all that s left is to tiptoe into the end zone  It s hard to blame people for getting excited that talks next month could get some traction  especially when the U S  Treasury Secretary made headlines this week about a  conceptual agreement  around intellectual property theft and President Trump talks about gestures of  goodwill  
That said  at some point  the proof is going to have to be in the pudding  so investors are going to have to be careful about getting too excited  The trade process has taken much longer than anyone expected thus far  and it s hard to believe things will get settled right away  Remember that back in April there was lots of optimism about an agreement getting close  Then the ball came loose 
Price War Goods Vs  Services  Are prices rising for U S  producers  Depends on the type of cost you re looking at  The wholesale cost of services climbed 0 3  last month  including record increases in gambling receipts  guest room rentals  insurance and  arrangement of freight and cargo   Marketwatch said  The wholesale costs of goods  on the other hand  fell 0 5   Prices fell for food  liquor  gasoline  and other forms of fuel 
This disparity between goods and services has persisted for much of the past year  Marketwatch observed  Wholesale service costs have risen 2 7  in the last 12 months vs  a slight decline in the cost of goods  The question is whether this pattern can last considering U S  tariffs going into effect on a variety of consumer goods  and the likelihood of producers passing along those price increases to their customers  Whatever happens in coming months on this front  analysts said there s nothing in yesterday s producer price data that would likely cause the Fed to rethink an interest rate cut next week 
Bean Barometer  China exempted some U S  products from sanctions this week  but it s interesting to see that two key products soybeans and pork didn t make the exempted list  Briefing com noted  A later news report said China is considering removing the restriction on U S  farm goods  One way you might really tell if things are thawing would be increased shipments of soybeans across the Pacific to China  but let s not get ahead of ourselves  Still  it s a development worth watching  Maybe call it the  bean barometer   China is the biggest consumer of soybeans in the world and accounted for 60  of U S  soybean exports before the trade war

9567,231082,DELL,5 Stocks Nearing Break Outs  Dell Moves Towards  61,opinion,"5 Stocks Nearing Monster Break Outs For The July 16 
S P 500  SPY 
It was a lackluster trading session on July 15  with the S P 500 finishing the day unchanged  You can look at this market and say it lacks enthusiasm  or you can look at the market and say that the market is robust  Strong enough that big moves up aren t followed by days of consolidation lower  but instead days of consolidation sideways  It would suggest to me that this an equity that wants to go higher 
The trend in the S P 500 is higher  and based on the current trend  the index is likely to take its next leg higher by midday tomorrow  Again  I continue to believe this is an index that is heading towards 3 050 to 3 055  
Russell  RUT 
The Russell continues to trend higher too  but it appears this one needs to consolidate for a few more days before it moves up  Based on the chart perhaps by July 18 or 19 

AMD  AMD 
AMD continues to perform very well  and the stock is now within striking distance of breaking out  I continue to believe that the stock rises above  34 50 and push on to  36 25 

Dell  DELL 
DELL continues to rise and is moving towards resistance at  55 40  The stock appears that it is getting ready to break out and move higher towards  61  
Amazon  AMZN 
Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  continues to consolidate but looks like it s getting ready to make its next move up  I m still looking for AMZN to rise to around 2 060 

Tesla  TSLA 
Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  is rising above  250 today  breaking out  without much fanfare  I believe the next stop is  260 and could be as high as  268  I noted this in my latest TSLA write up on July 10  

Applied Materials  AMAT 
Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  appears it is getting ready to break out and rise above  47 70 and push higher towards  51

9568,231083,DELL,Will China ETFs Survive The Moving Out Of US Firms ,opinion,In an attempt to escape Trump s heavy tariffs on Chinese imports  U S  companies with manufacturing units in China are increasingly shifting to  countries like India  Vietnam  Cambodia  Malaysia  the Philipines  Bangladesh and Ethiopia  These companies mostly belong to sectors like  One of the  showed that 40  of such companies are either planning or have shifted manufacturing operations from China   Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL    Alphabet Inc    NASDAQ GOOGL   and Nintendo Co  T 7974    Ltd    OTC NTDOY   along with other major companies have already shifted or are considering the same  Dell Technologies Inc    NYSE DELL   and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company   NYSE HPE   are also planning to shift  in China to Southeast Asian and other regions It is worth noting here that some companies based in the European Union are also a part of the league  In this regard  a recent survey conducted by the showed that among the companies heading out of China  67  were based in the European Union while 80  were US based firms Factors Behind the Move  were already shifting out due to high production and transport expenses in China in comparison to other Asian countries  They believe that the trade war has just accelerated the process  like smartphones  laptops  smart speakers  routers  and home IOT products face tough price competition and therefore price hikes to cover the tariffs may make these products exorbitant  Furthermore  there is high uncertainty whether the truce talks between the countries will reach any conclusion  If statistics are to be believed   between the presidents have failed so far  Such failures were usually followed by a revision of existing or imposition of new tariffs  In this regard  Trump mentioned in one his recent statements that the tariffs are being postponed for the  and any failure in resolution might lead to imposition of fresh tariffs How Hard Can the Blow be for China China s economy is witnessing a tumultuous phase  The world s second largest economy grew at 6 2  between April and June in comparison to 6 3  median prediction from a poll of 14 economists  conducted by  The GDP number also  recorded in the first quarter of 2019  However  the economic growth figure lies within Beijing s target growth rate range  in the latest round of the trade war  The U S  President raised tariffs to 25  from 10  on Chinese goods worth  200 billion effective May 10 midnight  and has threatened to levy another 25  tariff on an additional  325 billion of Chinese goods  In retaliation  China announced imposition of as much as 25  tariff on U S  imports worth  60 billion effective Jun 1  read    The country s export and import numbers are also dismal  On one hand  imports slipped to worse than expected levels in June while on the other  export data was sluggish  Notably   from the year ago period while imports declined 7 3   Slackening global economic growth also affected the trade numbers for the Chinese economy  Furthermore  factories were observed to be on a job cut spree  According to   U S  Census Bureau states that there was a 12  decline in imports from China through January to May in 2019  Given the scenario  this reordering of global supply chain process will further lead to a decline in Chinese export levels Moreover  the relocation of manufacturing facilities can be detrimental to the employment levels in China  Brooks Running commented in May that it plans to shift majority of its operations to Vietnam by 2019 end  This in turn will end up in moving  ETFs in FocusAgainst this backdrop  investors can keep a tab on a few China ETFs like iShares China Large Cap ETF   TE FXI    iShares MSCI China ETF   Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300

  like roads  airports or ports in other countries is a major deterrent  Sometimes U S  manufacturing companies come under the radar of the U S  government when they relocate to escape tariffs  In this regard stated that large quantities of Chinese made goods were being rerouted through Vietnam  Malaysia and the Philippines to dodge tariffs Meanwhile  some U S  companies are bound to pay huge tariffs due to  for some China made goods   Moreover  certain companies are planning to continue manufacturing in China in order to meet demand of the   However  all hopes are pinned on the ongoing

9569,231084,DELL,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Dell  Lenovo  Cisco And Hewlett Packard,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  June 11  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Dell Technologies   NYSE DELL    Lenovo   OTC LNVGY    Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   and Hewlett Packard Enterprise   NYSE HPE   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog Server Market Decelerates in Q1  DELL  HPE   MoreThe server market  which was showing signs of recovery beginning 2017  seems to have again landed in troubled waters  After experiencing six consecutive quarters of double digit revenue growth  the market seems to have slackened in 2019 with a single digit revenue rise witnessed in the first quarter Per International Data Corporation  IDC    worldwide server revenues inched up 4 4  year over year to  19 8 billion in first quarter 2019 while overall shipment dipped 5  to below 2 6 million units Going by IDC  revenues of volume servers increased 4 2  year over year to  16 7 billion while the mid range server registered a 30 2  surge to  2 1 billion  However  high end system revenues for a second consecutive quarter showed a steep decline of 24 7  to  976 million Also  IDC noted a 6  year over year climb in x86 server revenues  reaching a value of  18 5 billion  while revenues from non x86 servers dropped 13 7  year over year to  1 3 billion The research firm observed that a decline in demand from both enterprise buyers and hyperscale companies coupled with a tough year over over comparison was an overhang on the growth rate during the reported quarter Although lower unit shipments was a blow  the firm added that higher average selling prices  ASP   courtesy of enterprise s demand for richly configured servers  boosted the revenue growth rate for many vendors How Are the Vendors Poised Dell Technologies secured the top spot in both revenue market and volume share space  Over the last few quarters  Dell has continuously registered year over year growth in server revenues and managed to drastically taper the market share difference with Hewlett Packard Enterprise The reason for this stellar market share growth is that the company has been able to strategically capitalize on expanded opportunities from the EMC  NYSE EMC  acquisition  On the last earnings call  management mentioned weakness in the China market to be a relentless headwind  However  the company s focus on acquiring new customers is likely to boost its top  and bottom line growth going forward  Shares of the company have gained 11 1  in the year to date period HPE earned the second spot with 17 8  market share  The company is gaining traction from its focus on high margin businesses  such as server  storage and IoT among others  In the first quarter  per IDC  HPE witnessed a fall of 10 9  in shipment volume  Notably  decrease in the Tier one server sales poses a challenge to the company  HPE shares have returned 6 7  year to date The third position is a draw among Inspur Inspur Power Systems  Lenovo and Cisco  generating 6 2   5 7  and 5 3  share of total server revenues  respectively  IDC calls it a statistical tie when the gap among vendors is 1  or less Talking of Lenovo  the company expects to strengthen its position in high performance computing and AI and continue to invest in servers  storage and networking  It hopes to see a growing momentum in hyperscale business  courtesy of its unique in house design and manufacturing business model  In the year to date period  Lenovo shares have gained 8 2  Moving on to Cisco  the company has pioneered a network system  which is referred to as the Unified Computing System  UCS   This is a revolutionary blade server system  based on x86 architecture that is transforming data centers  In the last reported quarter  the company noted that its Data Center product category rode on the back of solid growth in both HyperFlex and servers  The Cisco stock has rallied 29 1  so far this year Is There a Silver Lining IDC believes that soft unit shipment volumes can be offset as long as surging demand for richly configured servers supports an uptick in ASP Moreover  we believe  a ramp down in hyperscale spend will be temporary as demand for cloud services is consistently robust  The global server market will steadily grow in the quarters ahead  mainly owing to hyperscale server deployments by cloud service providers There is a huge growth opportunity in the hyperscale server infrastructure space with more and more companies shifting to cloud based services  Moreover  proliferation of technologies  such as big data  artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving demand for hyperscale servers Also  Gartner s latest forecast for IT spending  reflecting 3 2  improvement in 2019  depicts a favorable tech expense environment  which we believe  will positively influence the overall server market in the near term Zacks RankWhile Lenovo  HPE and Cisco carry a Zacks Rank  2

9587,231102,DELL,3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week  Costco  Apple  Dell,opinion,"For investors  the past week was a wake up call  Other than the lingering U S  China trade dispute  many also realized there are additional risks starting to slowly pile up which have the potential to derail both the bull market in equities and the U S  economy in general 
Growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East  a post Brexit mess in the U K   and the weakening economic data in the U S  all combined with the ongoing trade impasse has kept investors nervous and caused equities to continue their losing streak 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0 7  last week  posting its fifth consecutive weekly decline  the longest negative streak for the mega cap index since 2011  With the macro environment likely to remain uncertain in the coming days  we re keeping an eye on three stocks that could move due to earnings reports and or developments in their sectors 
1  Costco Wholesale
The recent escalation in the trade tariff tit for tat has clearly taken its toll on investor sentiment  Now there are signs that it has started to hit some of the strongest pillars of the markets  such as retail stocks 

Once again the retail sector will come under scrutiny when Costco Wholesale  NASDAQ COST  reports its fiscal 2019 third quarter results on Thursday  May 30 after the close  Analysts are expecting  1 82 a share in profit for the period that ended on May 13  on sales of  34 65 billion  according to Investing com data 
Given the weak showing by some top retailers during their recently concluded quarters  chances are that Costco will offer a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year  The company s future guidance will be more important for investors at a time when cost pressures are rising because of the U S  China tariff hikes that have started to pinch retailers who import products from China 
As well  there is growing evidence from recent economic reports that the U S  economy is losing some steam  If that slowdown persists  it could hurt consumer sentiment as the year progresses  So far  however  Costco stock has remained an investor favorite  Closing at  247 30 on Friday  it has come back strongly from the December low  surging more than 30  
2  Apple Inc 
Among the top technology stocks  represented by the so called FAANG group  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  is one that s being hurt the most from the ongoing U S  China trade war  Shares of the iPhone manufacturer have fallen about 14  in the past one month  closing at  178 97 on Friday 

The stock weakened even further last week when several analysts raised concerns over the company s exposure to China  The stock ended the week down 5 3  
Investors might get some sort of reprieve in the coming week if the U S  and China soften their stance and agree on the resumption of stalled negotiations  China is Apple s third largest market  In the most recent full fiscal year  the company saw nearly  52 billion in sales 
Worries over the trade war s affect on Apple intensified after the U S  blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co  last week  raising fears that China will retaliate by targeting Apple and its supply chain which relies fairly heavily on Chinese manufacturing sources 
3  Dell Technologies
Dell Technologies Inc   NYSE DELL  will issue its first quarterly results since it re entered the public markets last December  The report will be released onThursday after the market close  on average  analysts are expecting  1 21 earnings per share profit on sales of  22 27 billion 

In its forecast for fiscal 2020  Dell had warned that sales growth will slow over the next year  hurt by the global economic issues that may weaken corporate demand for the company s hardware products  Last year  Dell consistently generated strong hardware sales  as the company prepared to transition back to the public markets after five years of restructuring aimed at cutting back debt and simplifying a tangled corporate structure 
Investors have liked the restructured Dell  sending its shares 45  higher this year  when compared with a 13  expansion in the S P 500 during that period  The stock closed at  66 12 on Friday ",2019-05-26,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-watch-in-the-coming-week-costco-apple-dell-200425174,200425174

9591,231106,DELL,NGL Energy Partners  NGL   What Will Q4 Earnings Unveil ,opinion,"NGL Energy Partners LP   NYSE NGL   is scheduled to release fiscal fourth quarter 2019 results before the opening bell on Thursday  May 30  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 27 cents per share on revenues of  6 1 billion 
In the preceding three month period  the diversified energy master limited partnership blew past the consensus mark  buoyed by its Crude Oil Logistics segment performance 
As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the Tulsa  OK based midstream operator has a bearish record  having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports  This is depicted in the graph below NGL Energy Partners LP Price and EPS Surprise

    
Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the partnership can surpass earnings estimate this time around 
Let s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
Two major segments of the partnership    Crude Oil Logistics  and  Water Solutions    are sending mixed signals with regard to NGL Energy Partners  results in the upcoming quarter 
Our model estimates fiscal fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA for the Crude Oil Logistics unit to be  45 6 million  falling 10  from  50 7 million in the fiscal third quarter but 43  above the year ago EBITDA of  31 9 million  The significant year over year growth reflects solid volumes on the partnership s 100  owned Grand Mesa Pipeline that carries oil from the DJ Basin to NGL Energy Partners  storage facility in Cushing  The conduit transported approximately 129 000 barrels per day on an average in the last quarter  rising 22  from the fiscal fourth quarter 2018 
Meanwhile  analysts polled by Zacks envision  Water Solutions  adjusted EBITDA to remain in line with the previous quarter  while improving 52  from the year ago level  The partnership processed approximately 999 000 barrels of wastewater per day  a 26 5  increase from the corresponding period of fiscal 2018  While the segment is expected to witness volume growth in the to be reported quarter as well  results will be affected by the recent sale of the Bakken and the South Pecos water assets   
What Does Our Model Say 
Our proven model too does not conclusively predict that NGL Energy Partners will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because it doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 0  
Zacks Rank  NGL Energy Partners currently has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be sure of the positive surprise 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for NGL Energy Partners  here are some firms you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
Dollar General Corp    NYSE DG   has an Earnings ESP of  2 16  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company is anticipated to release earnings on May 30  You can see  
Dell Technologies   NYSE DELL   has an Earnings ESP of  13 91  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is anticipated to release earnings on May 30 
Costco Wholesale Corp    NASDAQ COST   has an Earnings ESP of  2 19  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release earnings on May 30

9605,231120,DELL,6 Low Price to Book Stocks For Value Investors,opinion,Value investors actively look for stocks that they think the market has undervalued  It is their belief that the market overreacts to good and bad news  which results in stock price movements that do not correspond with a company s long term fundamentals  This  according to them  creates an opportunity to profit when the price of the stock goes down  Value investors turn to financial ratios to help analyze a company s fundamentals The price to book  P B  ratio is widely favored by value investors for identifying low priced stocks with exceptional returns  The ratio is used to compare a stock s market value price to its book value The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market price per share book value of equity per shareNow let us understand the concept of book value Understanding Book ValueThere are several ways by which book value can be defined  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment equal to A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space Here are six of the eight stocks that qualified the screening Mallinckrodt Public Limited Company   NYSE MNK    a specialty

9606,231121,DELL,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Mallinckrodt  Dell  American Axle  Daqo And General Motors,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 22  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Mallinckrodt Public Limited Co    NYSE MNK    Dell Technologies Inc    NYSE DELL    American Axle   Manufacturing Holdings  Inc    NYSE AXL    Daqo New Energy Corp    NYSE DQ   and General Motors Company   NYSE GM   Buy These 5 Stocks with Attractive Sales Growth Right NowSteady sales growth is vital to the survival of any business  Sales growth not only offers an insight into product demand and pricing power  it also is important for growth projections and strategic decision making Nonetheless  investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric  This might be because of investors  preconceived notion that a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum But investors must look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise  This is because in cases where companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future performance Further  investors should make sure that sales are not only increasing but the growth rate is rising as well  Sales growth rate for the current year should exceed the prior year s growth Therefore  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  This metric s importance lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues  unlike earnings However  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits  Hence  considering a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments For the rest of this

9607,231122,DELL,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Cisco Systems  Dell Technologies And Cree,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   February 25  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Cisco Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CSCO    Dell Technologies Inc    NYSE DELL   and Cree  Inc    NASDAQ CREE   
Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  
3  Internet of Things  Stocks to Buy Right Now
 The  Internet of Things  essentially connects household products  industrial devices  vehicles  and much more to allow for advanced monitoring  Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices 
For example  consumer level IoT products include things like Amazon s Echo  smart speaker   wearable motion and activity tracking products from the likes of Fitbit and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   and advanced in car technology  On the commercial side of the IoT market  industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency 
One of the more obvious plays here for investors is semiconductor stocks  as chipmakers should be able to benefit from the growth of connected devices  But some chip stocks  including powers like Nvidia  have been sluggish recently  With that said  IoT is set to become nearly ubiquitous  which means investors can try to profit from its growth in countless industries and firms    
So today we ve found three stocks which have been flagged by the Zacks Rank that could be poised for further IoT growth soon 
1  Cisco Systems  Inc  
This historic networking and tech giant expanded its IoT business in recent years  offering clients the chance to connect everything from transportation fleets to assembly lines in order to run their operations more efficiently  Cisco sells IoT related hardware and software  among other connectivity solutions  and saw its revenues climb 7  in its recently reported quarter to top Wall Street estimates  CSCO also beat earnings estimates despite having to raise some of its prices for switches and routers in order to combat trade war focused tariffs on Chinese produced goods 
Cisco stock has surged 16  this year and hit a new 52 week high Friday on the back of its continued post earnings momentum  Looking ahead  our Zacks Consensus calls for Cisco s current quarter earnings to surge 17  on the back of 3 4  revenue growth  CSCO has also experienced a ton of positive earnings estimate revision activity to help it earn its Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Plus  Cisco is a dividend payer that is trading in line with its industry s average P E at 17 4X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which also marks a discount compared to its year long high of 18 5X 
2  Dell Technologies Inc 
Dell Technologies returned to the public markets at the end of December  roughly five years after the company s founder took the company private  Shares of the PC and data storage giant have climbed nearly 15  in 2019 and the company is set to release its fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 financial results on Thursday  February 28  Dell bolstered its IoT business in the run up to its return to the stock market and now offers smart video monitoring solutions  IoT connected bundles  data center level compute  storage  and networking that bolsters bandwidth  and more   
Dell is projected to see its fourth quarter revenues jump 7  to reach  23 46 billion  while its adjusted full year earnings are expected to climb 7 3   The company is also trading at 7 9X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  This marks a huge discount compared to the IT Services Market s 17 6X average and the S P 500 s 16 9X  Dell sports  A  grades for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system and is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  at the moment 
3  Cree  Inc 
Cree is a manufacturer of LEDs and semiconductors that enhance the value of solid state lighting  power and communications products  The company s  SmartCast  platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms  CREE sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has experienced gains of 24  in the past three months to crush its broader industry s 14  average climb 
Peeking ahead  analysts expect Cree s current quarter earnings to skyrocket 300  and its current fiscal year earnings which ends in June to soar over 310   That growth is expected to continue to the tune of another 63  in the following year  Current estimates also see Cree s revenue growth in these years reaching 10  and 11   respectively  which means the company might not see the pullback some on Wall Street expect other semiconductors to witness in the near future 
Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN 
Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius

9611,231126,DELL,Server Market Data Release For Q4  Dell   HPE Lead The Way,opinion,Recovery in the server market  which began in 2017  continued with the momentum last year as well  re infusing optimism among server vendors  Per International Data Corporation  IDC   worldwide server revenues witnessed improvement  marking its fifth consecutive quarter of double digit year over year growth  Moreover  total revenues hit an all time high in a single quarter ever  adds the firm Referring to the data compiled by the research firm  worldwide server revenues increased 12 6  year over year to  23 6 billion in fourth quarter 2018 while overall shipment grew 5  to nearly 3 million units IDC noticed revenues of volume servers expanding 17 8  year over year to  19 billion while the mid range server registered a 30 3  surge to  2 5 billion  However  high end system revenues declined 28 3  to  2 1 billion Also  IDC noted an 18 7  year over year rise in x86 server revenues  reaching a value of  21 1 billion  while revenues from non x86 servers contracted 21 6  year over year to  2 5 billion IDC observed that decline in demand from hyperscale companies was an overhang on the company s growth rate during the reported quarter  However  the research firm added that increased server sales to enterprise customers boosted results  Additionally  higher average selling prices  ASP   courtesy of enterprise s demand for richly configured servers to support resource intensive workloads  bolstered server revenue growth However  we believe  deceleration in hyperscale spend will be temporary as demand for cloud services is consistently robust  The global server market will steadily grow in the quarters ahead  mainly owing to hyperscale server deployments by cloud service providers Dell Levels Market Share Score With HPEWith respect to individual server manufacturers  Hewlett Packard Enterprise   NYSE HPE   and Dell Technologies   NYSE DELL   jointly secured the top spot on the revenue market share front  IDC calls it a statistical tie when the difference among vendors is 1  or less  Therefore  if we look at the actual revenues  then Dell holds the first position with 18 7  market share and 20 4  growth while HPE grabs the second slot with a market share of 17 8  and growth of 10 5  Over the last few quarters  Dell has continuously registered year over year growth in server revenues and managed to drastically taper the market share difference with HPE In fact  the company achieved the number one position in the last two quarters  The reason for this stellar market share growth is that the company has been able to strategically capitalize on expanded opportunities from the EMC  NYSE EMC  acquisition Moreover  HPE is now focusing on the enterprise market and departing from the firm s hyperscaler business  which has been denting its short term revenues  Nonetheless  its loss helped Dell clinch a market share in the hyperscale segment Moving ahead  International Business Machines   NYSE IBM   has captured the third position with a market share of 8 3   However  the company s server revenues declined 27 6  as sales of Power Systems generated through the company s partnership with Inspur Power Systems in China are excluded from it The fourth position is a draw between Inspur Inspur Power Systems and Lenovo   OTC LNVGY    If we look at the actual revenues  then Inspur occupies the fourth position with 6 6  while Lenovo has the fifth place with 6 2  Furthermore  IDC provided revenues and shipment data for the ODM Direct group of vendors  These vendors ceaselessly record huge year over year growth in revenues and market share as large datacenters find it attractive to custom build their server designs at potential volume prices In terms of volume  Dell won the peak position with a market share of 19 4  while HPE seized the second spot with a market share of 15 8   Meanwhile  Inspur held the third spot with 8 3  share  Huawei and Lenovo followed with the fourth stand  thereby ending the quarter with market shares of 7 1  and 6 4   respectively Growth Across All RegionsRegion wise  IDC viewed server revenue rise traversing most regions  Asia Pacific  excluding Japan  witnessed fastest growth with a 25 5  increase  followed by Latin America recording 15 4   Europe  the Middle East and Africa  EMEA  registering 15 2   Japan 5 3  and the United States reporting a 5 1  increase  China recorded year over year vendor revenue growth of 30 7  in the reported quarter  Canada fell 5 7  Bottom LineIn our opinion  there is a huge growth opportunity in the hyperscale server infrastructure space with more and more companies shifting to cloud based services  Moreover  proliferation of technologies such as big data  artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving demand for hyperscale servers Also  Gartner s latest forecast for IT spending  reflecting a 3 2  improvement in 2019  depicts a favorable tech expense environment  which we believe  will positively influence the overall server market in the near term These trends will benefit server providers like Lenovo and HPE  particularly  While Lenovo sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   HPE carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Is Your Investment Advisor Fumbling Your Financial Future See how you can more effectively safeguard your

9628,231143,DELL,Tech Sector Earnings  Analysts Expect A Slowdown,opinion,"Normally the information technology sector is seen as a higher growth arena  but that doesn t look to be the case this quarter as Q4 earnings season gets underway 
As of Jan  9  the blended revenue growth rate  a measure that includes analyst estimates and reported results  is just 1 7  year over year  according to Reuters data  That s lagging every other sector except for utilities  Top line results are expected to grow at a faster pace  with a blended earnings growth rate of 8 5  year over year  7th out of 11 sectors  Granted  some of that has been attributed to certain tech companies being shifted to the newly formed communications services sector 
Matching the high level data  a few of the biggest names in the space have warned of a sales slowdown  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  is often looked to as a barometer for the tech sector due to its size and global reach and it flashed warning signs recently that its fiscal Q1  which ended December 29  wasn t going to be what the company or analysts had hoped 
In an investor letter  CEO Tim Cook lowered AAPL s revenue guidance for the quarter to  84 billion  4 8  lower than last year s results for the same quarter  Analysts had been expecting closer to  91 billion for the quarter and AAPL previously forecasted revenue in the range of  89 billion to  93 billion 
Apple s reasons for the lowered guidance read like a laundry list of the growing concerns that analysts have had about the broader tech sector  Apple CEO Cook cited challenges in emerging markets and said  we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration  particularly in Greater China   while noting that more than 100  of the company s year over year revenue decline occurred in that region  In addition  Cook pointed to increased consumer uncertainty in China amid heightened trade tensions between the U S  and China 
Guidance updates like this can often weigh on sector sentiment until results from more companies are released or other data emerges 

Bouncing Back into Q4  The S P Technology Select Sector Index  IXT  has been bouncing back after a rapid decline through the last few months of 2018  The macro environment has been filled with uncertainty and Q4 earnings might provide some hard data that could play a part in whether or not the sector can make a sustained breakout out of its recent downtrend  Chart source  thinkorswim  by TD Ameritrade  Not a recommendation  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Tech Filled Holiday Shopping
Ahead of the holidays  the Consumer Technology Association was forecasting that U S  consumers would spend a record  96 1 billion on tech in the 2018 holiday season  October December   good for a 3 4  year over year increase 
U S  retail sales figures for December were supposed to be released by the Census Bureau Wednesday but they have been delayed due to the shutdown  so the latest retail data is limited to November  Those results showed that U S  retail sales had increased 4 2  compared to November 2017 
Over the holidays  there were some positive reports regarding consumer spending  Adobe  Analytics reported that Cyber Monday was the biggest U S  online shopping day ever  with consumers spending  7 9 billion overall  According to Adobe s report  Take Two Interactive s  NASDAQ TTWO  Red Dead Redemption 2 video game  Nintendo s  NTDOY  Switch console and Dell  NYSE DELL  and Apple laptops were some of the top selling items 
For consumer focused tech companies that generate a large portion of their sales during the holiday season  this quarter s results are likely to be particularly important as they enter the slower time of the year 
Digital Payments And Tech
PayPal  NASDAQ PYPL  is a stock you might expect to find in the S P Technology Select Sector Index  IXT   Mastercard  NYSE MA  and Visa  NYSE V   on the other hand  you might not  Regardless  stocks in the digital payments space had a banner year relative to the broader market  PYPL ended 2018 with a 13 88  return  while V and MA put up 15 22  and 24 19  increases  One of the biggest performers in digital payments was Square  NYSE SQ   with a 55  return  despite pulling back  45 from its October high of  101 15 
As cash usage decreases in many markets globally and some retailers go cashless  the digital payments space has been eyed by many analysts as one that could continue to grow for some time  Non cash transactions are expected to grow at a 12 7  compound annual growth rate  CAGR  from 2016 to 2021  with emerging markets growing at a 21 6  rate  according to a 2018 report from Capgemini and BNP Paribas  PA BNPP  
Even though analysts appear to be widely optimistic about the space  an overriding concern is valuation and that some companies will likely need to execute flawlessly to deliver on investor expectations  For example  forward P E ratios for the companies mentioned above can vary from 26 to 90 today 
At the same time  any attractive market brings competition  Not only are companies like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and Alphabet  GOOG  GOOGL  pursuing opportunities in the space  regional players like StoneCo  NASDAQ STNE  and PagSeguro  NYSE PAGS  abound as well

9631,231146,DELL,6 Promising Price to Book Value Stocks With Solid Prospects,opinion,Among valuation metrics  price to earnings  P E  and price to sales  P S  are more commonly used for stock selection  This is because calculations based on earnings and to some extent sales are easy and come in handy  However  the price to book ratio  P B ratio  has emerged as a convenient tool for identifying low priced stocks with high growth prospects The P B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock  It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter s book value per share P B ratio   market capitalization book value of equityWhat is Book Value There are several ways by which book value can be defined  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily

company  In most cases  this equates to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S

9634,231149,DELL,6 Low Price to Book Value Stocks To Buy In February,opinion,The price to book  P B  ratio is widely favored by value investors for identifying low priced stocks with exceptional returns  The ratio is used to compare a stock s market value price to its book value The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market price per share book value of equity per shareP B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share  So  if the share price is  10 and book value of equity is  5  investors are ready to pay two times the book value  Ideally  a P B value under 1 0 is considered good  indicating a potentially undervalued stock  However  value investors often consider stocks with a P B value under 3 0 Now let us understand the concept of book value What is Book Value There are several ways by which book value can be defined  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible

One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a

9647,231162,DELL,Shift Focus From Profit  5 Stocks With Rising Cash Flows,opinion,Cash is the lifeblood of any business and is reflective of a company s true financial health  It lends the company flexibility to make decisions  the means to make potential investments and the fuel to run its growth engine Although making profits is a company s primary goal  having a healthy cash flow is imperative for existence  development and success  And why not  Even a company generating profits succumbs to failure and faces bankruptcy while meeting obligations if it has a dearth of cash flow  But one can efficiently tide over any market mayhem if it has the cash to shield it To find this efficiency  one needs to consider its net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business Therefore  keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows Screening Parameters To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time  we ran

9650,231165,DELL,5 Tech Stocks That More Than Doubled FAANG In 2018 ,opinion,On Dec 4  the FAANG group of stocks lost  140 billion in a searing market slide  The trading session was symptomatic of a year which has been a tough one for the group  FAANG stocks may have led gains during the longest Bull Run in the U S  stock market history  but in 2018 they were weighed down by individual weaknesses and broader market concerns Analysts now believe that the group s troubles are far from over  With macroeconomic risks on the rise and a tougher rate environment around the corner  FAANG s problems may just be getting started However  analysts believe that though the broader tech sector had a difficult 2018  it remains a good investment option  Small companies focusing on innovation may be better bets heading into next year  This is why it makes for a smart to invest in select tech stocks that returned double the FAANG group s gains in 2018  Macroeconomic Concerns Weigh on FAANGIn 2017  high growth tech stocks were all the rage  The FAANG group had powered the post recession rally to a significant extent and by the middle of last year  they looked all but invincible  However  by the third quarter of 2018  things began to unravel for the group until they suffered severe declines By late November  all the FAANG names had lost more than 20  from their most recent peak  pushing them into a bear market  With the U S  China trade war intensifying  macroeconomic concerns heightened  pushing investors toward defensive sectors  Additionally  the Fed seemed unwilling to shed its new found hawkishness Individual Weakness Contribute to SlideStock specific weaknesses also contributed to the group s decline  At this point  Facebook   NASDAQ FB   is the worst performer of the group  down 17 8  year to date and more than a third lower than its recent July peak Data privacy concerns  sparked off primarily by the Cambridge Analytica incident  has been the primary cause for this downturn  On Mar 19  the social media giant s shares tanked 6 8   recording its worst decline in four years  after it was accused of a data misuse scandal that affected the personal information of more than 80 million users Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   and Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   have also performed poorly  gaining 0 7  and 1 9  year to date  Also  Apple shares are down nearly 30  from the time when it was valued at a phenomenal  1 trillion  Questions about flagging iPhone demand have haunted the stock this year  forcing analysts to adopt a cautious approach Coming to Alphabet and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    both the tech majors  most recent sales numbers lagged expectations  However  Amazon remains one of the most successful members of the group  with shares up 41 8  year to date  The e commerce

promise with shares up 43 5  year to date  Analysts also remain optimistic about its chances in the immediate future  but its stock seems pricey to many  Further  it has failed to escape the broad

group s increase of 3 2  over the same period  The broader tech sector has also endured a volatile year  but could be on the verge of a major comeback  A large part of the debate now centers around whether we are witnessing the end of a correction or the start of a bear market Despite lingering concerns  the U S  economy is in far better shape than most of the rest of the world  A strong labor market and booming consumer confidence is fueling gains  Chances of a U S  China trade deal have increased over the last few weeks and if such an agreement does take place  tech stocks will look much more appealing Our ChoicesWhile opinion is divided over the prospects of FAANG members in 2019  the majority of analysts think tech remains a solid long term prospect  After all  the sectors is made up of some of the most influential and rich companies in the world  One rocky year can hardly change these facts But now it may make more sense to seek out smaller companies  especially those focusing on innovation  Given the lingering concerns over the pricing and valuation of bigger tech names  these could emerge as better long term prospects  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This

9651,231166,DELL,Scoop Up Big Gains With 5 Stocks Having Swelling Cash Flows,opinion,Equity markets in the United States enjoyed an uptrend in the first of 2018 as improving economy and corporate tax cuts instilled confidence among consumers of their well being and promoted healthy capital investments  But as the year progressed  the initial gains were wiped out and the markets entered a correction mode amid volatility in oil prices  trade war with China  rate hikes  tariff impositions on a number of foreign countries as well as softening in the global economy Amid these  laying a wager on stocks based on profit numbers appears a popular strategy  But looking beyond profits and figuring out a company s efficiency in generating cash flows can be far more rewarding  This is because cash is the most indispensable factor for any company  It gives strength and vitality  and is the key for its existence  development and success Cash is  in fact  the lifeblood of any business and is reflective of a company s true financial health  And why not  Even a company generating profits succumbs to failure and faces bankruptcy while meeting obligations if it has a dearth of cash flow  But one can efficiently tide over any market mayhem if it has the cash to shield it To find this efficiency  one needs to consider its net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business Therefore  keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows Screening Parameters To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time  we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5 year average cash flow per common share  This implies a positive trend and increasing

9653,231168,DELL,Here s What To Expect From Hewlett Packard Enterprise  HPE  Earnings ,opinion,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise   NYSE HPE   saw its stock price jump 3 3  during regular trading hours Monday as part of a larger tech and market resurgence driven by the weekend s positive trade war news  So  let s see what to expect from Hewlett Packard Enterprise s quarterly financial results Tuesday to help us understand if the company might be able to keep this momentum going 
Overall  some of the biggest names in tech from Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   to Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   have seen their stock prices fall during the last few months  Yet  the tech sector as a whole has performed rather well during third quarter earnings season  with total earnings up 27  from the same period last year on 13  higher revenues  also read    
Last quarter  HPE saw its revenues jump 4  to  7 76 billion  However  the company  which was officially formed in 2015 after Hewlett Packard split into HPE and HP Inc    NYSE HPQ    has failed to live up to investor expectations  The firm sells enterprise level servers  storage  and networking gear  and has lost ground to the likes of Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   and Dell   NYSE DVMT    Plus  the cloud computing age has seen Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   eat away at its business 
 
Outlook
With all that said  Hewlett Packard Enterprise s quarterly earnings are projected to pop 2 5  to reach  7 85 billion  according to our Zacks Consensus Estimate  Better yet  the company s adjusted quarterly earnings are excepted to soar 48 3  to reach  0 43 per share  Still  we need to know how likely it is that HPE tops our quarterly earnings estimate since this could determine how the company s stock trades following its release 
Luckily  we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to help us  The Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
HPE is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and sports an Earnings ESP of 0 00   Unfortunately  this means that our model is inconclusive  But  investors should note that the company has topped our quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing four periods 
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is set to release its fiscal fourth quarter financial results after the closing bell Tuesday

9672,231187,DELL,FireEye s  FEYE  Loss Narrows In Q1  Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,FireEye Inc    NASDAQ FEYE   started 2018 on a strong note  posting impressive results for the first quarter  The company s Q1 performance indicates that its turnaround efforts  which include shifting the business model to a subscription based one  are apparently paying off  The main highlights of the quarter were sales beating expectations  strong growth in billings  a narrower loss and an upbeat guidance for the full year  And most importantly  the company expects to turn profitable this year However  it seemed this was not enough to impress investors  as shares of the cybersecurity company dipped more than 4  during yesterdays  after hour trading session  Nevertheless  the company s performance  for the past two quarters  makes it quite evident that its turnaround initiatives are on track  and there is a high chance that FireEye might return to the growth trajectory by the end of this year Notably  shares of FireEye have gained remarkably in the year  so far  with the stock appreciating 30 7   significantly outperforming 19 1  growth registered by the   Now  let s discuss the quarterly results in detail RevenuesThe company s first quarter revenues of  199 1 million increased 7 7  year over year and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  194 million  as well as management s guidance of  192  197 million The company noted that its quarterly revenues mainly benefited from shift in the business model from product based to subscription based  This apart  improved sales execution  enhanced relationship with channel partners  and growing adoption of the company s Helix  iSIGHT Intelligence and Endpoint security solutions were other key growth drivers Further  billings climbed 21  year over year to  175 1 million  and came in marginally ahead of management s guidance of  165  175 million  mainly attributed to all the factors mentioned above Additionally  FireEye continues to secure large deals  Notably  the company renewed one deal of more than  10 million during the reported quarter  Moreover  it closed 29 transactions  with individual value of more than  1 million  The company also added 230 new customers in the recently reported quarter Operating ResultsNon GAAP gross profit increased approximately 7 4  from the year ago quarter to  147 3 million  Non GAAP gross margin were almost flat year over year at 74   which also came in line with management s expectations Non GAAP operating expenses increased approximately 6  year over year to  153 million  primarily due to elevated expenses related to payroll taxes and other employee associated costs  and elevated R D expenditure in connection with buyouts of  Email Laundry in Q4 2017 and X15 in Q1 2018  The company posted non GAAP operating loss of  5 7 million  significantly lower than the year ago quarter s loss of  7 3 million  We believe improved operational efficiency and sales productivity are proving conducive to the company s operating results Non GAAP net loss for the first quarter narrowed down to approximately  7 5 million from the prior year quarter s net loss of  9 3 million On per share basis  FireEye reported non GAAP loss of 4 cents  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Year over year  quarterly loss were narrower than the year ago quarter s loss of 5 cents  The quarter

the end of fourth quarter 2017  During the quarter  the company generated  9 2 million of cash from operating activities GuidanceBuoyed by the impressive first quarter results  improved operational efficiency and sales productivity  as well as healthy demand for intelligence led security products  FireEye issued an encouraging outlook for the second quarter and raised its revenue  billings and operating cash flow guidance for the full year For the second quarter  the company anticipates revenues of  199  203 million  mid point   201 million   which is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Billings are projected at  180  195 million  Non GAAP gross margin is estimated to be approximately 74   while non GAAP operating margin is estimated in the band of  2  to  1  The company

expenditure is still estimated to be between  35 million and  40 million Our TakeFireEye s management has been striving to turn around the business through a string of initiatives  which includes product launches  acquisitions and cost optimization  We believe the company s turnaround strategies are paying off as evident from its back to back five quarters of splendid results Additionally  although a shift from product based to subscription based business model will have a negative impact on FireEye s near term results  we believe it will lead to more stable revenues over the long run However  a shorter contract length is likely to affect the company s near term top line performance  Nonetheless  there is an advantage to the shorter length contracts  as these generally generate higher margins compared with three year contracts Currently  FireEye carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Some better ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are CoStar Group  Inc    NASDAQ CSGP

9676,231191,DELL,Zacks com Highlights  Commercial Vehicle Group  Koninklijke DSM N V   Dell Technologies And QuinStreet,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 14  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  Commercial Vehicle Group Inc    NASDAQ CVGI    Koninklijke DSM N V    OTC RDSMY    Dell Technologies Inc    NYSE DVMT   and QuinStreet  Inc    NASDAQ QNST   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Bet on 4 Stocks with Rising Cash Flows to Scoop Up GainsThe Q1 reporting cycle is almost over and it is usual for investors to now crunch profit numbers and evaluate surprises of companies  But evaluating a company s cash level can be far more rewarding This is because even a profit making company can have a dearth of cash flows and struggle to meet its obligations if its profits are not channelized in the right direction to fund future growth  But a company with adequate cash flows can effectively tide over any market mayhem besides enjoying flexibility in decision making and chasing potential investments  In fact  even though   profit is a company s goal  cash is its lifeblood for existence and a measure of resiliency To find this efficiency  one needs to consider its net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business Therefore  keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other

9683,231198,DELL,Are We Headed For A Bigger Tech Bubble Than The One In 2000 ,opinion,"What if I told you that today s tech bubble is more hazardous than the one that popped in 2000  You might say   That s crazy  Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Google  NASDAQ GOOG    today s internet oriented superstars are real companies with real profits  
Granted  all of these corporations are profitable  They may be rapid growers as well  That does not mean investors are paying reasonable or rational prices for their fractional stakes 
Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  and Dell Technologies Inc  NYSE DVMT  represented roughly 50  of the market capitalization of the NASDAQ 100 in 2000  They too earned boatloads at the turn of the century  That did not stop them from losing three fourth or more of their value in the 2000 2002 tech wreck   Note  Cisco is still 35  below a nominal all time high from 18 years ago  

Today  the  FAANG 5  account for a large percentage of the S P 500 as well as nearly 40  of the NASDAQ 100  Facebook 5 5   Amazon 10   Apple 12   Google 9   Netflix 2    Meanwhile  the foolishness associated with gaining even more FAANG exposure in portfolios can be seen in everything from margin debt excess to closed end fund premiums 

Speaking of closed end funds  CEFs   I recently came across a tweet regarding Nuveen s NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund  NASDAQ QQQX   It is trading at a 15 7  premium to net asset value  What does this CEF do to command such a premium  It sells covered calls  That s it 
Now  you do not have to be a brain surgeon to write covered calls  So the 15 7  premium coupled with the 0 9  management fee borders on the absurd  And yet  QQQX boasts  830 million in assets under management  Indeed  you can literally see the moment when this silliness jumped the Arthur Fonzarelli shark 

QQQX regularly traded at a discount to net asset value  Then came the November 2016 election and the prospect for sharp tax cuts for corporations  QQQX has since traded at a premium  with the exception of the January 2018 blow up in the  short volatility trade  
Keep in mind  QQQX holders are not merely long an exorbitantly overpriced NASDAQ 100 at a double digit percentage premium  They are simultaneously shorting FAANG volatility to generate income  Did they miss what happened to short volatility plays this past January 

 Come on  Gary   you say   Today is nothing like 2000 s dot com disaster  Back then  people were betting on Pets com  eToys  theGlobe  Buy com and Webvan  
Yes  the stock market eventually woke up to the insane valuations for those dot com IPOs  The subsequent punishment was swift and severe  Nevertheless  were they truly less viable than billion dollar unicorns like WeWork  Buzzfeed  Pinterest  Credit Karma or Bird 
Consider a company that most people love  Uber  It has plans to  go IPO  in 2019  Yet it lost nearly  3 billion in 2016 and has lost  4 5 billion in 2017  Not only does it lose tons of cash  but there are halfway decent competitors  It may be a phenomenal company with the goal of becoming the  Amazon of transportation   but the valuation of  68 billion is exactly the type of IPO silliness that occurred in 2000 

In truth  another tech wreck is more likely than not  The only question is the catalyst 
Nobody has ever irrefutably identified the catalyst or catalysts for the the March of 2000 stock meltdown  Still  there is some agreement on the notion of Federal Reserve policy error  In particular  Fed tightening activity encouraged the 10 year s 200 basis point rise between the Asian Currency Crisis lows of 1998 and the first quarter of 2000 
In a similar vein  the Fed tightening cycle that occurred between 2004 2006 led to a 10 year yield that rose 200 basis points off of the 2003 lows  Marginal subprime borrowing became more and more of a challenge at those higher rates  eventually spreading like a cancer throughout the global financial system and ushering in the 2008 catastrophe 
It follows that central bank manipulation may be the catalyst for a bearish turn this time around  Like 1998 2000 and 2004 2006  we are participating in a Fed tightening cycle where the Fed s quantitative tightening  QT  may contribute to the 10 year reaching 200 basis points above its lows   Note  We witnessed 1 36  on the 10 year yield back in July of 2016  

The 3 11  level is still 25 basis points shy of a true 200 basis point move  That said  the Fed s current approach   a combination of raising its overnight lending rate and the reduction of bonds on its balance sheet   increases the cost of capital  And when the cost of capital rises  less credit worthy borrowers will be in a world of hurt 
Remember  50  of S P 500 corporations are rated BBB  That s just one notch higher than junk rated debt  Even in a mild period of contraction for the economy  many of those would be downgraded to junk  forcing investment grade bond funds to sell them  Other bondholders will want to liquidate as well 
When everyone wants to sell and few are looking to buy  what happens to price  What happens to liquidity  or the likelihood that the bid ask spread will widen to unbelievable extremes  People who own a junk bond priced at 88 and who hope to sell it near that price could discover that 76 is the best that they re going to get 
Junk bonds themselves may already be sending up a smoke signal  The 50 day moving average of the SPDR Barcklays High Yield Bond ETF  NYSE JNK  crossed below its 200 day moving average in March  Moreover the current price is below both the 50 day and 200 day trendline 

Ironically enough  if there is enough debt contagion in the euro zone  the Fed might slow its pace of quantitative tightening  QT   And if that occurs  lower rates may keep the unicorns as well as the NASDAQ 100 going strong for a while longer 
On the flip side  there are far too many companies worth a fraction of their  1 billion plus valuations  Those who blindly pay any price for a tech filled future   cloud based computing  electric vehicles  artificial intelligence  robotics  sharing economy  crypto  etc    are gambling with their financial well being 
Riding a wave can be exhilarating  Just make sure to have a plan for getting off of the wave

9684,231199,DELL,Tesla Shares Soar On Elon Musk  420 Target Tweet ,opinion,"Elon Musk taught every CEO a dangerous lesson today  Musk  CEO of Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   tweeted today that
 am considering taking Tesla private at  420  funding secured  
Tesla stock prior close was around  342  After his tweet  Tesla stock shot up almost 11  to close at  379 57 today and rising to  383 after hours at this writing 

Going Private   Dell Technologies Inc  NYSE DVMT  vs  Tesla
There s a reason there are so many SEC regulations governing what not to say or act by company C level executives  Let s take Dell as an example  Michael Dell took Dell private in 2013 and Dell stockholders got paid  13 65 per share to leave the company on its own  That price is higher than the  11 range Dell stocks were hovering at 
The point is that rumors did float around about Dell being bought out  but Michael Dell never personally released any statement regarding a target price  Company executives are banned from discussing company stock price due to the potential unfair and biased market moving effect  let along giving a target price that is 23  higher than the last close of  342 
 Greed Knows No Limit 
Elon Musk not only set a price target of  420  but also followed up with another tweet minutes later that
 Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares   go private  
It seems the purpose of this tweet is to twist the knife a bit more to ensure investors not selling Tesla stocks and  encourage  more buying to bring the stock price up to his target of  420 
Greed certainly knows no limit 
For a company that has never made a profit in 15 years with cash burn and leverage at insanely alarming rate  Musk actually has the nerve to imply Tesla is undervalued at even  360 level  If this is not the most blatant stock and market manipulation to the umpteenth degree  I cannot imagine what else would top it 
It is one thing that some layman says the same thing  which is not capable of moving the market  it is entirely another when a celebrity CEO such as Elon Musk talks up his books like this 
The Inevitable Reality of Tesla 
I m certain Elon Musk is sophisticated enough to know what he said and did may land him in legal troubles but why did he do it anyway  My assessment suggests Tesla is indeed in serious financial trouble as many analysts have warned  and this looks like Musk s last ditch desperate attempt to hide the records from the public and the SEC before Tesla goes bust 
Then the challenge became how to ensure  desirable  funding and valuation before the buyout    by propping up the stock price as much as possible by any means  of course  Michael Dell followed the CEO SEC rules and let the market decide the  fair  price which resulted in his equity partners snatched up his company for a song  Elon Musk is not about to let that happen to Tesla which is inevitable as the reality sets in and his charisma and renewed promises can only go so far 
Insatiable Ego in the Wrong Place 
Tesla is the most shorted U S  stock  for good reasons  and Elon Musk has a long standing feud with those short sellers  Musk has moved mountain and earth  laying off many workers and his bizarre earnings call notwithstanding  to keep up with the appearance that Tesla s production ramp up is on schedule to appease investors as it is sadly the only thing investors can find some consolation  He even went as far as borrowing personal loans to buy Tesla shares  a majority of them at the historical high  creating a less liquid market thus punishing the shorts 
According to Zero Hedge  Elon Musk has personally borrowed  624 million in loans from various investment banks as of March 2017  including Goldman and Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   to buy Tesla stock  and that loan number is estimated to reach  800 million by now  That is almost like colluding with banks that most likely hold Tesla stocks to arrive at a win win for all  This goes way beyond just a feud with short sellers and yet another desperate act to keep stock price afloat  Again  I do not believe this is even legal for any CEO to artificially manipulate stock price like this 
Fact Speaks for Itself  but Which Fact  
I get that every CEO tends to think their company stock is under valued due to something intangible the investing community has failed to take into consideration  However  the best way to crush the nay sayer is to let the fact speak for itself  Make good product at good price dominating the market and let the profits show what your company is really worth 
That  800 million personal loan would have gone a lot further investing back into Tesla to hire higher skilled workers and competent supply chain management professionals  I question the motive and intellect of going as far as borrowing millions of dollars just to buy company stocks for the sole purpose of jacking up the stock price and crushing the shorts     unless the Tesla fact cannot speak for itself to what Musk wants 
Where Is SEC in All This 
Another reason Musk chose to make such moves is that the current weak SEC and a  tolerant  financial regulatory environment has emboldened almost everyone from the President  Central Banks to   Elon Musk to  dabble  in market moving  tweets  or acts and nothing would ever stick 
On the other hand  many of the Tesla short positions are by very powerful fund managers and institution investors  Musk s tweet today probably caused enough pain and legal ground for these power houses to launch a legal assault on Elon Musk  Whether it will stick or not probably will depend on the bigger political environment after the mid term and presidential re election 
Mourning the Loss of Ethical Standards 
On a side note  I cannot help but mourn the loss of ethical standards in America today  I am not talking about some high moral ground  but the basic right from wrong 
The response to the Elon Musk s tweets today centers around if  420 if really Musk s target  how Musk came up with that valuation  why would anyone even bother to ask    Most news media I read are in awe that Musk s target of  420 will likely be met in no time  Musk also openly tweeted thanks to investor s support  Yet nobody questions this previously considered taboo illegal act by a prominent CEO 
Government officials and company executives used to be held at a much higher moral and ethical standard so to lead the public by example  That sadly has gradually gone down the drain over the past two decades ",2018-08-08,EconMatters,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tesla-shares-soar-on-elon-musk-420-target-tweet-200337209,200337209

9692,231207,DELL,Exclusive Interview  How Alex Green Beat the Market 16 Years Straight,opinion,"For more than a decade and a half  my friend Alexander Green has been educating and entertaining investors as editor of numerous popular newsletters  many of which I ve cited in my own writing 
Alex s articles are brimming with intelligence  wisdom  humor and candor all of which he brings to his public appearances at investment conferences 
Last week it was my pleasure to speak one on one with Alex  and together we touched on subjects ranging from our favorite books on investing to the secret lives of millionaires to business moats 
Below are highlights from the interview  but this is only the first of two parts  I ll conclude it next week in a Frank Talk  which  
Enjoy 
You didn t go into politics or medicine or law  What triggered you to go into the investment world 
At the time  I was living in Orlando  I got a copy of the Orlando Sentinel  and on the front page of the business section was a headline that read   The average stockbroker in the U S  makes  187 000 a year   This was in 1985  Thirty years later  that s still a substantial amount of money  I remember thinking   If the average stockbroker makes  187 000  what do the good ones make  
I crammed the article into my wallet and started telling everyone that I was going to become a stockbroker  Someone then told me that he had just sold a phone system to a broker in Winter Park  Florida  and he was looking to hire someone 
I went out and talked to him and got my first job in the money management business  At the small firm where I started  I was writing research reports and client communications  I discovered I enjoyed research and writing even more than dealing with clients  so when the opportunity arose to become a time financial writer  I took it  That was about 17 years ago 
You ve published four books so far The Gone Fishin  Portfolio  The Secret of Shelter Island  Beyond Wealth and An Embarrassment of Riches  Tell us about the genesis of one or two of them 
 I was speaking at a conference in Phoenix about 10 or 12 years ago  and when I came off stage  this older gentleman was waiting for me  He poked his finger at me and said   Money  money  money  You ve made a lot of money over the years  but I have to ask  do you ever think about anything else  
At first I thought he was kidding  but come to find out  he really felt that I thought about nothing but money all day long  I realized then that I write hundreds of columns a year  and virtually every single one is about stocks or bonds  currencies or commodities  interest rates or economic growth  This guy figured I thought about nothing except money and how it s made  Of course  we all have our outside interests  and we hope for some kind of balance in our lives  And so when I went back home to Baltimore  I came up with the idea to write something expressing the idea that life isn t just about making money  I wanted to talk about living a rich life  not just about getting richer 
This led to a column I initially called  Spiritual Wealth   That name  though  became a problem since the word  spiritual  is one of the most nebulous words in the English language  It can mean any number of different things to different people 
I eventually changed the name to  Beyond Wealth   which is probably more accurate anyway  It turned into a series of reflections on things that I thought were important things I d read or done that I felt were of interest  All of it had very little to do with money  Those articles became one of the most popular things we do  and the eventual book turned out to be a bestseller  I was glad to have found a wider audience out there 
At this year s FreedomFest conference in Las Vegas  you debated with The New York Times  Robert Frank about meritocracy and luck  Robert argued that our success in life is mostly due to luck  and you disagreed  Could you talk about that  A good book to read on this subject is Thomas Stanley s The Millionaire Next Door  Dr  Stanley spent a lifetime researching the habits and characteristics of the nation s wealthiest individuals  I might add here that the Spectrum Group revealed that  as of the end of 2016  one out of every nine households in the U S  had a net worth of  1 million or more  What Dr  Stanley found is that these millionaires have many characteristics in common  Primarily  they do everything in their power to maximize their income and minimize their expenses  They religiously save and invest the difference  then leave the money alone to let it compound for years  if not decades 
That s how most people become millionaires  regardless of their color  sex or orientation not by establishing a software company in their garage or making a hit record or playing third base for the Yankees  Most people just work hard  save  invest and compound 
How does that thinking apply to the market 
A few years ago  a guy named Burton Malkiel wrote a book called A Random Walk Down Wall Street  He said that it s very difficult to beat the market  and even those who do beat it do so because of luck  not skill  So you can see we re coming to the same sort of argument as Robert Frank 
The independent Hulbert Financial Digest has ranked our Oxford Communiqu  in the top 10 investment newsletters in the nation for 16 years now  We beat the market for one year  two years  five years  10 years  16 years now  People would say   Well  you re just lucky   It s a tough thing to argue against  But when enough time goes on  and you continue to beat the market  it should clue someone in that there s more than luck at play 
Would you say that Warren Buffett is just simply lucky  No  he s a financial genius who s taken actions that others haven t  and he s reaped the rewards  When Roger Federer won his 19th singles major title recently  nobody said   Wow  he s really lucky  
I admit  everyone has certain amounts of good and bad luck in their personal and professional lives  But to say that luck is the only determining factor is dispiriting to people who have come the furthest  It s demeaning to say that it s all luck  not education or hard work or persistence 
Similarly  the people who consistently beat their benchmarks are not just lucky  If you do it long enough  it s clearly evidence of skill 
Tell us about your  Gone Fishin   portfolio  How do you look for investment opportunities  The Gone Fishin  portfolio is based on the idea that  since nobody knows with any certainty what the economy or market is going to do  it s sensible to make the foundation of your portfolio a diversified  asset allocated basket of index funds  You want to make sure your expenses are low and that you have high tax efficiency and your asset classes are properly represented 
Simple and straightforward 
The idea is that there are 10 different asset classes in the portfolio  and you invest according to various percentages  30 percent in U S  stocks  30 percent in foreign stocks  10 percent each in high grade bonds  high yield bonds and Treasuries  and 5 percent each in real estate investment trusts  REITs  and gold shares 
Then  at the end of every year or on your birthday or anniversary rebalance the portfolio to bring all the target percentages back into alignment  That reduces your risk because you re cutting back on what s depreciated the most and adding to what s depreciated the least  Over time  this adds to your return while reducing the portfolio s volatility 
What would you say to someone right now who s nearing retirement age or who has just retired 
I don t think enough people think about this  to be honest  Frank  Like you  I ve been invested in the market for over 30 years  and when I was in my 20s  30s and 40s  we had horrific selloffs like the stock market crash of  87  the financial bust that happened when the internet media ended  and then of course the financial crisis  When you re younger  you realize you ve still got decades ahead of you  and you can take actions that allow you to be comfortable with whatever your long term scenario might be 
But as you get older  after you reach the age of 50 or so  it becomes necessary to reevaluate your goals  There s a bus out there waiting for us as we cross the street  The thing about getting older is  you have to reduce your risk  You re not going to be working that much longer or maybe you re in retirement already and you just don t have the time to make it back should there be a market crash  I always say to make your portfolio as conservative as you can live with once you reach this stage of your life  It might crimp your returns  but it s also going to save your butt if we go into another financial crisis like we did in 2008 
Are there any books on investing you d like to recommend  How did they help you  
One book I would recommend is by William O Neil  the founder of Investor s Business Daily  It s probably 30 years old and has gone through some updates since then  O Neil is looking for companies that have high sales growth  25 percent or better compounds in earnings  higher returns on equity  great product innovation  good management and sustainable profit margins 
But to be honest  I think there s only so much you can learn from books  I say that because you have to learn the hard way and actually feel the terror of a down draft  or fight the instinct to be greedy when you go through a long  full market as we re in now 
So who do you look to  Where do you get your wisdom and insight 
In the mid 80s  there were three legendary investors  Warren Buffett  Peter Lynch and John Templeton  I started reading and listening to everything I could all the Berkshire Hathaway reports  but also tapes of Templeton and Lynch speaking at conferences 
No one knows what the economy or stock market is going to do  but Buffett  Lynch and Templeton knew to identify a business that was selling for a lot less than what it was worth and hold it until the market recognized that value  That sort of became the mantra for me from then on 
It was then that I realized I was not going to play this guessing game about what GDP growth is going to look like  what inflation s going to be  what the Fed or stock market is going to do  That s all a distraction  What really matters is individual businesses beating Wall Street expectations  That s what drives stocks higher in the long term 
I often tell investors at conferences that  if you look back through history  you d be hard pressed to find a single example of a company that increased its earnings  quarter over quarter  year after year  and not see its stock tag along  It doesn t matter what kind of market we re going through or what kind of economy we re in  those stocks tend to appreciate really strongly 
One of the publications you edit is the Momentum Alert  Can you tell us what that is 
Speaking of beating Wall Street expectations  this is exactly what we focus on in the Momentum Alert  These companies tend to be superbly managed  but most important  they have a moat around the business  Let me give you three examples 
Blockbuster  Radio Shack and Borders all went bust  There was no way for those companies to protect their margins  whether they were renting video tapes  selling electronic equipment or selling books and CDs  They had nothing to protect them from competition coming in and doing it on a bigger scale or doing it online 
Winning businesses tend to have something that protects margins  That could be a copyright or trademark or patent  Profits attract competition just as honey attracts bears  You re not going to come across a really profitable niche and find that other people don t want to exploit it also  You need something to keep them at arm s length 
Think of the difference between IBM  NYSE IBM  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   IBM made its systems compatible  so other companies Dell  NYSE DVMT  and Compaq  for example came in and made IBM compatible machines 
No one makes an Apple compatible machine because Apple never leased its patents to another company  All of those profits for the iMacs  iPhones  iPods and so on all go straight to Apple  That s the kind of magic that can really help propel a stock up for longer periods of time

9694,231209,DELL,Hewlett Packard Has A Big Amazon Problem,opinion,"  but Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  looms from  
I joined CNBC this evening to chat about Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co  NYSE HPE  latest earnings announcement 
Hewlitt Packard Enterprise investors got some much needed good news on Tuesday  as the company beat third quarter estimates  Shares are up over 4  after hours  Earnings came in at 31 cents per share  better than the 26 cents expected by analysts  Revenue also beat by a wide margin   8 2 billion vs  an expected  7 5 billion 
Importantly   future HPE   or HPE minus its software group  saw sales rise 6   Sales growth has been hard to come by in recent quarters  so this was welcome 
But let s not get too carried away here   less bad than expected  would be more accurate than  better than expected   Margins continue to sag  operating margins declined from 9 9  to 8 4   and the outlook for the remainder of the year wasn t exceptionally rosy  This is a case of a company beating bad expectations 
HPE is in a tough spot here  The traditional server market is no longer growing  2nd quarter industry wide numbers aren t available yet  but shipments were down 4 2  in the first quarter  according to Gartner  after being down big in the fourth quarter as well  Some of this is due to difficult comps  but let s not miss the elephant in the room  Amazon s AWS 
With virtually all growth going to Amazon and Microsoft s respective cloud services  Hewlett Packard Enterprises is left to duke it out with Dell Technologies Inc  NYSE DVMT  and IBM  NYSE IBM  to grow market share in a no growth market  That s a terrible place to be 
So  the simple answer is that HPE needs to compete in the cloud  But that is now far easier said than done with Amazon  and to a lesser extent Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   having the first mover advantage  Jeff Bezos has repeatedly said   Your margin is my opportunity   To say he is a worthy adversary is an understatement 
So  if computing is moving away from traditional enterprise computing setups and into the cloud  couldn t HPE focus on selling directly to Amazon or Microsoft 
No  Both companies tend to build their own hardware using commoditized parts  There is no reason for them to pay up for a brand name like Hewlett Packard 
HPE is really pushing its  hybrid  model  which allows enterprise users to move data needs between local servers and the cloud  It s an interesting concept  and I expect they ll get some amount of traction from it  But this is something that very large enterprises are already doing for themselves  so their market here is small and midsized companies who might prefer the simpler solution of going all cloud  I would be cautiously optimistic here  but this is far from a slam dunk 
HPE has a rough road in front of it and  barring major change  likely faces a slow road to irrelevance

9695,231210,DELL,Amazon Gains On Goldman Note  AWS Re Invent Heats Up,opinion,"Shares of Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   rose Tuesday morning after Goldman Sachs   NYSE GS   reaffirmed its buy rating for the online retail and cloud hosting behemoth as its AWS re Invent innovation conference kicks into full gear 
Goldman analyst Heath Terry reiterated his  Buy  rating for Amazon in a note to clients on Tuesday  The analyst also raised his target price to  1 450 per share from  1 300 per share  The new target would mark a 21  upside over the next 12 months  based on Monday s closing price of  1 195 83 per share 
Terry noted that he expects speedy innovation from Amazon in the coming months  which he projects the company will begin to introduce during Amazon Web Services  global customer and partner conference  Amazon Web Services is the company s on demand cloud computing division  which is geared towards companies  governments  and individuals
 2017 started Sunday night in Las Vegas and is set to run through Saturday  Dec  1  The conference has historically been a platform for Amazon to introduce new products  partnerships  and services for its highly important web services division 
Terry noted that the number of announcements in 2016 jumped to 15 after Amazon made less than ten each during the first three years of the conference   We continue to believe Amazon s pace of innovation  increasing pricing flexibility  and an aging corporate technology base  will drive the ongoing shift of workloads into the cloud    
Amazon Web Services boasts that it can support almost any size workload and currently has over one million active customers in 190 countries  AWS has worked with Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX    Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE    Comcast   NASDAQ CMCSA    Airbnb  PBS  and many more big names 
The Goldman analysts also touched on the success and growth of Amazon s more consumer facing retail businesses  He pointed to the acquisition of Whole Foods and new ventures into the world of healthcare and logistics as reasons to be even more excited about Amazon s future 
AWS re Invent Update
Amazon has already introduced a few new offerings at AWS re Invent in Las Vegas  One of the first new services is   which is designed to make it easier for developers to build virtual reality  augmented reality  and 3D applications for an array of platforms and devices Don t miss the Global Partner Summit at  2017 with Terry Wise  VP of Global Alliances  Ecosystems   Channels    AWS re Invent   AWSreInvent  What s more  Amazon announced a new  with Time Warner s   NYSE TWX   Turner division that will see Turner use Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider 
On top of that  the company introduced five new AWS   MediaConvert  MediaLive  MediaPackage  MediaTailor  and MediaStore  According to an Amazon company   the new Element services are an  integrated suite of services that make it easy for video providers of all kinds to create reliable  flexible  and scalable video offerings in the cloud  
Amazon also already announced an expanded  with the popular cloud platform VMware  which is a subsidiary of Dell Technologies   NYSE DVMT

9696,231211,DELL,FAANG Vs  4 Horsemen Of The  90s,opinion,"During the late 1990s tech boom  investors fell in love with the remarkable price appreciation of four mega cap public corporations  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  and Dell  NYSE DVMT   They became known as the  four horsemen  for their unparalleled influence  In fact  at points in 1999 and 2000  the group accounted for as much as 55  60  of the NASDAQ s price movement 
Perhaps ironically  some of these hold forever stocks began losing a bit of their appeal as dot com mania kicked into gear  Investors began believing that the 21st century had ushered in an entirely different paradigm on how and what to invest in  Regardless of traditional metrics like profits or sales or book value   New Economy  standouts like Sun Microsystems  JDS Uniphase and EMC  NYSE EMC  were capturing investor imagination as well as market share 
As a national talk radio personality in the late 1990s and early 2000  I cautioned listeners about the sustainability of the gains that they had come to expect  Naysayers insisted I was too bearish  Of course  most of those naysayers had never witnessed what a bear market could do  Indeed  near the very top in March of 2000  a prominent writer at the Motley Fool castigated my guidance to have a plan for getting off the surfboard when the wave ceased to be worthy of the risky ride 
Never raise cash  that was what the financial community advised the public  It did not matter that investors had been staring at the most extreme overvaluation in stock market history  It did not matter that the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  Of Omaha  Warren Buffett  had been laughed into obscurity for his obstinate opposition to the pricing for revolutionary technologies  And it sure as heck did not matter that a young buck on terrestrial radio  yours truly  chose not to give an  all systems go  approval 
In reality  I had been defensive  downshifting form 70  stock to 50  stock  The fundamental overvaluation required me to be less aggressive  Yet I did not make a tactical shift to a genuinely bearish 33  highest quality stock allocation until key technicals broke down 
For example  when the S P 500 s month end closing price had finished below its 200 day moving average on September 30  2000   the technical evidence was clearly indicating a marketplace shift toward risk aversion  I lowered my stock allocation and raised my cash allocation  Moreover  I let tens of thousands of folks know about what I was doing  helping many of them to sidestep the bulk of the tech bubble s implosion 

Although I may have been learning to tie my own snow boots in Kindergarten during the early 1970s  I am keenly aware of the crazy love investors gave to the  Nifty Fifty  stocks  As always  mainstream financial advice told investors to hold all of those stalwarts throughout their lifetimes  Even if those companies were selling at outrageous multiples of 40x  why would you sell them  General Electric  NYSE GE   Xerox  NYSE XRX   Sears  NASDAQ SHLD   Polaroid  Coca Cola  NYSE KO    no reason to ever sell those legends of industry 
Unfortunately  there were a few flaws with the idea of holding the  Nifty Fifty  to infinity and beyond  First  even when a business appears viable for decades into the future  like a Coca Cola or a GE  an individual stock itself is not guaranteed to remain  nifty   Innovative new companies supplant the supposed untouchables  Second  similar to the four horsemen s predominance in the NASDAQ s price movement  the Nifty Fifty had been responsible for most of the price gains of the S P 500 and most of the losses in the S P 500 s decade long struggles to recover capital 

It s not that nominal dollar amounts would not still be accumulated via dividends in this period had an investor held on for 10 years  Yet why must one ignore the risk of losing so much in the first place  as though the 1973 1974 bear couldn t have been deeper  The Nasdaq managed to lose 80  of its value this century  The Dow managed to lose 90  the previous century  Isn t Japan still down some 50  after 28 years  Why should investors wait 17 plus years to recover purchasing power via inflation adjusted returns  when less volatile assets show potential to outperform head to head and on a risk adjusted basis 
I have put this forward before  but it is worth repeating    Do the homework on the Ivy Portfolio yourself  Examine taxable and tax deferred accounts  The risk adjusted performance  e g   Sharpe  standard deviation  etc   is undeniable  The head to head may be a close call  Nevertheless  if you never wish to find your nest egg falling from  1 400 000 to  700 000  and then deciding whether to stay the proverbial course because you ve been assured that the U S  stock market has always recovered before  perhaps Job  1 should be to protect capital from severe downtrends 
Consider Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   BRK B   In 4 years  his cash war chest has bloated from  40 billion to  100 billion  In spite of the pile  Buffett s team clearly does not see an opportunity to buy awesome corporations at a fair price  Additionally  he is keenly aware that the higher the price he pays  the lower the prospective future returns  Is it any surprise that the Oracle of Omaha finds the pickings rather slim 

Not only is Buffett willing to wait for attractive deals  since few exist   yet he is known for waiting patiently for sharp corrections and bears  Who would be better positioned to take advantage if stocks and or the economy struggle mightily 
Signs of overextended bullishness may already be emerging  The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  has not seen cash allocations as low as they are today since the Asia Currency Crisis in 1998 and the tech bubble of 2000 

For those who may sheepishly accept the notion that the economy is humming along  they may want to get a gander at the leverage that households  government s  and corporations have employed to achieve meager results  Consider real GDP using a 10 year average  Does anyone get the sense that our economic enhancements since the Great Recession is commensurate with taking federal government obligations from  10 5 trillion to nearly  20 trillion  Is that bang for the buck  And can we really accelerate from here 

I might have a little more confidence had corporations used the doubling of their debt levels for productive purposes  Sadly  due to interest obligations  now and in the future   coupled with the most leverage in corporate history  something may have to give  Earnings per share could suffer  Dividend growth could slow  And  in some instances  present promises abandoned 

This is not to say that the stock market will cease to grind higher  Nor would I suggest that a 5  to 10  correction would fail to become the next dip buying opportunity 
What I will say  however  is that the  FAANG  phenomenon smells like rookie spirit  Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  are hardly unbeatable  They re actually vulnerable 
Not only did the overwhelming bulk of the Nifty Fifty reach their limits of growth  not only did three of the four horsemen hit theirs as well  but  FAANG  exists at a time where leverage in the financial system has never been greater  It follows that when margin calls eventually occur  which leveraged stocks are likely to get slammed the hardest 

Let me close with a bit of media hype from the year of the financial crisis  2008  There are those who will tell you that they could see the recession and the stock market sell off coming  Some did  Investor s Business Daily interviewed me at the very start of January in 2008  where I gave the odds of a recession at 80   That didn t mean I sold everything  I did not  I warned people to employ an exit strategy for reducing some exposure to the riskiest assets in their portfolios 
On the flip side  the biggest names at the biggest institutions on Wall Street had no intention  or no ability  to caution the investing public  On the contrary  Every single one of them believed that 2008 would be a banner year from earnings as well as stock prices in the S P 500  They collectively projected stocks would finish the year in a range from 1525 1750  though it ended at 903 

In other words  do not expect Wall Street to help you with a plan to protect capital  Their job is to get you to  Buy  buy  buy  ",2017-08-09,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/faang-vs-the-4-horsemen-of-the-late-90s-200206362,200206362
9697,231212,DELL,The Business Of Golf As PGA Tour Season Arrives,opinion,"Welcome to the latest episode of Full Court Finance  the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports  business  and the stock market  On this week s episode  Zacks producer and avid golfer Daniel MacPherson joins the show to discuss the current state of golf and the big business surrounding the PGA Tour as the 2018 season swings into full gear 
The golf world is abuzz with the possibility of a 2018 PGA Tour season that could see the long awaited return to success for Tiger Woods  as his presence alone often substantially boosts television ratings and overall interest in the sport  With millions of dollars invested in television coverage  the likes of NBC   NASDAQ CMCSA    Fox   NASDAQ FOXA    CBS   NYSE CBS   and ESPN   NYSE DIS   are all actively rooting for Woods who missed a majority of the last few seasons due to injuries to remain healthy 
Still  no matter if Woods makes a real comeback or not  the PGA Tour is still a big draw for sponsors as the likes of AT T   NYSE T    FedEx   NYSE FDX    Microsoft   NYSE T    Dell Technologies   NYSE DVMT   and many other major companies are all heavily involved in golf through sponsorships and more 
On top of that  despite Nike   NYSE NKE   exiting the golf equipment business and Adidas   OTC ADDYY   selling TaylorMade  the two sportswear powers are still major players in golf apparel even as struggling Under Armour   NYSE UAA   grows its golf segment  What s more  other golf focused companies including Titleist and Footjoy owner Acushnet Holdings   NYSE GOLF   and Callaway Golf   NYSE ELY   have done well 
Lastly  despite gloomy attitudes about golf s future  the game and business of golf are far from doomed  as amateur interest continues to be spurred by the rise of fun and recreational golf outlets such as Topgolf

9698,231213,DELL,Pivotal Software Could Be Solid Buy,opinion,"Say your company is about cloud software these days  and it seems like investors will rush out to stuff wads of money in your pockets  Unfortunately  cloud software company Pivotal Software  NYSE PVTL  showed in its Friday IPO that that is not always the case  Even though it raised  and has a valuation of nearly  4 billion after its IPO according to Forbes  it did not see a major boost on the first day of trading and saw its value fall to near its initial levels  Pivotal did do better on Monday as the company s shares rose in the morning before finishing at  17 26  but it still is not a terrific start 
Given how other tech companies  such as Zuora and Dropbox  had great success in their public debuts  Pivotal s lack of initial success could be construed as a reason to stay away  But as  points out  the mediocre showing was likely due to the bad luck of debuting on a day when tech stocks took a hit  rather than to fears about the company  And at this lower price point  Pivotal could in fact be an opportunity to buy low 
There are some reasons that investors may want to stay away from Pivotal such as its strong relationship with Dell and its lack of profitability  But there is a lot to like about the direction this company is taking  and investors should definitely hop on board if it falls to its IPO price level 
Heading in the Right Direction
As noted above  Pivotal Software is yet another cloud software company  Its unique approach is that its cloud software  Pivotal Cloud Foundry  is used to help other companies develop their own cloud software  This makes it easier for businesses to move away from legacy technologies and create something unique that is tailored for them  Given the increasing importance of cloud technology and personalization in modern business environments  there is no doubt that this is a company with potential 
As a result  Pivotal has seen its financial numbers improve over the past three years  According to its   total revenue increased from  280 million in the fiscal year ending January 29  2016  to  509 million two years later  Furthermore  most of the revenue increase came from Pivotal s cloud software subscription as opposed to the professional services and consulting fees which made up the majority of Pivotal s revenue in 2016 and 2017  Given that the software subscription boasts much higher margins  this is excellent news 
Pivotal is unprofitable and it repeats the standard line of how it may never be profitable  But net losses are decreasing  as losses per share improved from   4 42 to   2 38  Pivotal also intends to use the IPO proceedings to fund further marketing and research expenses  which shows that debt is at a manageable level 
The Dell Relationship
Pivotal Software s financial numbers are acceptable  the company is growing  and it is an important and growing field  But what has investors worried is its relationship with the lately struggling Dell 
Pivotal was acquired by EMC in 2012  which in turn was acquired by Dell in 2016 shortly before it went private  Even after going public  Pivotal states that Dell Technologies will own  70 1  of our total outstanding shares of common stock and approximately 95 9  of the combined voting power of both classes of our outstanding common stock immediately after this offering   and will thus be able to control all matters requiring approval by stockholders 
Pivotal did stress that the funds raised by this IPO will not be going to Dell  which has been struggling with high debt and  since merging with EMC  But there is no guarantee that Dell may not try to raise funds at Pivotal s expense at some point in the future  especially since the two companies could be competitors in certain sectors  Pivotal also notes that it faces significant competition from legacy software companies such as IBM and Oracle  as well as public cloud offerings from Google and Amazon 
However  investors should remember that Pivotal s relationship with Dell carries certain benefits  Pivotal itself  that together with Dell it can help businesses adapt a multi cloud strategy with a platform to innovate and build cloud software  Pivotal may not be able to count on Dell for support  but it will probably not be dragged down by Dell and is an attractive investment in its own right 
Plenty of Potential
Investors may consider holding off on Pivotal until we get a clearer picture of the share price  Yet at its current price  Pivotal Software is a  4 billion business in a thriving and important field  has decent financial numbers  and is tied with a technology giant which offers some potential upsides  While there is nothing wrong in displaying some caution  investors should consider this stock at its current value  and all the more so if it falls closer to the IPO price ",2018-04-23,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pivotal-software-could-be-solid-buy-200308076,200308076
9699,231214,DELL,NCR Tops Q1 Earnings   Revenue Estimates  Reaffirms  18 View,opinion,NCR Corporation   NYSE NCR   started 2018 on a strong note  reporting better than expected results for the first quarter  The company s non GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 56 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents  The reported figure also came in ahead of management s guided range of 41 47 cents  On a year over year basis  however  the tally remained flat RevenuesThe company s revenues of  1 52 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 47 billion  as well as came in 2 6  higher year over year The company s Software revenues  on a reported basis  were up 2  to  460 million  The upswing was primarily due to a 9  and 8  increase in Cloud and Professional Services  which was partially offset by an 18  and 1  decline in Software License and Software Maintenance revenues  respectively Services revenues climbed 8  to  601 million on a reported basis  This upswing primarily stemmed from the company s  channel transformation  initiatives  which resulted in growth of hardware maintenance and implementation services Hardware revenues  however  slipped 3  year over year  on a reported basis  to  456 million  Segment revenues from ATM  SCO and IPS declined 7   24  and 100   respectively  which negatively impacted the overall hardware revenues  The decline in ATM revenues was due to low backlog at the beginning of the first quarter However  revenues from POS ascended 19   which slightly offset the decline of the other three segments  The rise in POS revenues was chiefly attributable to  store transformation trends  NCR Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   MarginsNon GAAP gross profit for the quarter remained flat year over year at  431 million  Nevertheless  non GAAP gross margin shrunk 80 basis points  bps  to 28 4  as benefits from productivity improvements in Services segment were more than offset by reduced software license revenues and lower Hardware margins Non GAAP operating expenses during the quarter came in at  283 million  reflecting an increase from  273 million in the year ago quarter  mainly due to increased sales investments as part of the company s focus on expansion of its strategic offers Elevated expenses resulted in a decrease in income from operations  which on a non GAAP basis  came in at  148 million  down from  158 million reported in the year ago period  Also  operating margin contracted around 90 bps on a year over year basis to 9 8  Non GAAP net income from continuing operations was  85 million compared with  87 million in the year ago quarter Balance Sheet   Cash FlowThe ATM and POS manufacturer exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately  348 million  down from  537 million reported in the previous quarter  Receivables were  1 34 billion However  NCR has a highly leveraged balance sheet  The company ended the quarter with  3 04 billion of long term debt in its book compared with  2 94 billion reported in the previous quarter In the first quarter  the company used  24 million of cash for operational activities  For the quarter  free cash outflow was  99 million During the quarter  the company repurchased  165 million of its common stock GuidanceThe company reaffirmed its outlook for 2018  NCR anticipates revenues to be flat to up 3   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  6 65 billion Non GAAP earnings per share are expected in the range of  3 30  3 45  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  3 34 Per the U S  tax reform  the company expects effective tax rate for 2018 to be 24   The company expects free cash flow for 2018 to be around 90  of the non GAAP net income Coming to the second quarter outlook  NCR expects revenues in the range of  1  to  1   The company expects non GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter quarter in the range of 60 65 cents  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 74 cents Bottom LineNCR reported impressive first quarter results  The company s focus on growth of cloud segment and modernization of services business are proving to be worthy  especially at a time when its ATM segment is not performing well  NCR is also focused on its strategy related to hardware manufacturing  aimed at reducing costs and headwinds from hardware cycles Moreover  the addition of products  including the likes of  Picklist Assist  for identifying fruits and vegetables purchased by a customer  has enriched its solutions portfolio as well Nonetheless  weakness in the ATM market and escalating costs pertaining to introduction of products  and other sales related investments continue to be a drag on the company s financials Zacks Rank and Key PicksNCR carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Some better

9707,231222,DELL,Logitech  LOGI  Q4 Earnings Top  FY18 Sales Touch Record High,opinion,Logitech International SA   NASDAQ LOGI   maintained its impressive streak of earnings beats for the 10th consecutive quarter  On an adjusted basis  the company s fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings came in at 32 cents per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents  Earnings also marked improvement of 2 cents from the year ago quarter s figure of 30 cents Inside the HeadlinesNet sales for the quarter rose 16  year over year to  592 4 million  comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  564 million  Revenue growth stemmed from solid performance in Logitech s Video Collaboration  Gaming businesses  and Tablet   Accessories  partially offset by a lackluster Mobile Speakers business  Moreover  the company s ASTRO acquisition continues to be conducive to its overall performance Creativity and Productivity business comprises four sub business lines   Keyboards and Combos  Pointing Devices  PC Webcams  and Tablet and Other Accessories  All of these registered remarkable year over year improvement  which  we believe  is mainly due to a stabilizing PC market Gaming surged 77  year over year to  127 million  supported by strong momentum across its latest products  Meanwhile  Video Collaboration grew 41  to  55 million  In addition  smart home category witnessed marginal sales growth of 2  to  16 million However  the Music business  which comprises Mobile Speakers units and Audio PC   Wearables  put up a disappointing show  Audio PC   Wearables sales declined 8  to  55 million  while Mobile Speaker segment sales plunged 65  to  14 million Non GAAP operating margin contracted 60 basis points year over year to 9 3   while non GAAP operating income climbed 9 2  year over year to  55 1 million Logitech International S A  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Fiscal 2018 Result HighlightsThe company will like to remember fiscal 2018 for at least one reason that is attaining the highest ever sales mark  Logitech s fiscal 2018 revenues jumped 16  year over year to a record high of  2 57 billion  and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 54 billion  Revenue growth also came ahead of management s earlier expectations of 12 14   The company s non GAAP earnings per share increased 13 5  year over year to  1 60 and handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 53 LiquidityAs on Mar 31  2018  Logitech s cash and cash equivalents were  641 9 million compared with  564 9 million as of Dec 31  2017  Additionally  the company generated operating cash flow of  90 2 million for the fourth quarter  and   346 3 million during the full fiscal GuidanceLogitech reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal year 2019  It still expects non GAAP operating income of  310  320 million  Further  the company anticipates fiscal 2019 sales to be up in the high single digit range  on constant currency basis Bottom LineLogitech remains optimistic that steady traction of its product lines  as well as upbeat industry trends  will continue to fuel growth  We believe the bullish momentum in Gaming and Video Collaboration businesses  along with the thriving cloud based video conferencing services  will continue to be catalysts for the company s growth  In addition  the Astro buyout is expected to enable the company to leverage the console gaming market and help accelerate its long term growth Furthermore  it seems that the PC market is moving toward stabilization after several years of decline  which is likely to benefit the company as it might bolster the sales of its most profit maximizing products like desktops and diverse porting tools In addition to the above  the company is coming up with innovative products to cope with the rising trend of smaller and mobile computing devices with touch interfaces which have been rapidly changing the market  and usage models for PC peripherals and webcams Nonetheless  escalating R D expenses  as well as economic challenges in Russia and Europe might dampen its earnings  and remain concerns for the company  Also  strong competition in the sector is another major headwind Currently  Logitech has a Zacks Rank  3

9719,231234,DELL,Stocks  Oil  U S  Dollar Jump In Wake Of Strong Payrolls Report,opinion,The U S  stock market climbed on Friday and other markets gyrated violently in the wake of a very strong Nonfarm payrolls report for June   Stocks actually fell in the early going after gapping higher  but significant buying pressure in afternoon trading sent the major averages out near session highs  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed nearly 150 points  Other asset classes that did well on the day included crude oil and the U S  dollar   Precious metals and Treasuries  however  were both crushed in the wake of the upbeat payrolls report  Although risk appetite was brisk in the equity market  sharp increases for interest rates and oil prices could quickly become cause for investor concern   If current trends persist  higher interest rates and gas prices will become significant headwinds for the economy   Major Averages The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 147 points  or 0 98 percent  to 15 136   The S P 500 climbed around 16 points  or 1 02 percent  to 1 632   The Nasdaq jumped 36 points  or 1 04 percent  to 3 479   Nonfarm Payrolls The Nonfarm payrolls report for June showed that the economy added 195 000 jobs  This was identical to the increase in recorded in May  The figures came in well ahead of consensus estimates  helping spur another rally in the equity market  Economists had expected payrolls to rise 166 000 for the month   Private payrolls rose 202 000  which was less than the 207 000 jobs that were added in the month of May  This was also significantly ahead of consensus expectations which called for an increase of 180 000 in private Nonfarm payrolls   Unemployment Rate The unemployment rate for the month of June was 7 6 percent  This was unchanged compared to May  and in line with consensus expectations   Hourly Earnings and Average Workweek Aggregate earnings last month rose 0 6 percent  This was primarily driven by a better than expected 0 4 percent increase in average hourly wages  which came in ahead of estimates calling for a rise of 0 2 percent   The average workweek remained unchanged compared to the prior month at 34 5 hours  This was exactly what the consensus expected  The labor participation rate rose to 63 5 percent versus 63 4 percent previously  The one basis point rise in labor participation equals 177 000 new jobs in the month  a solid if not spectacular figure   Commodities The rally in stocks helped to drive oil prices higher on Friday  Crude oil is now trading firmly above  100 and higher prices may begin to be reflected in other economic indicators    potentially becoming a headwind to growth   Late in the day  NYMEX crude futures were up another 1 79 percent to  103 05  Brent contracts had jumped 1 76 percent to  107 40  Natural gas lost 2 percent on the session and was last trading at  3 62   As money moved into equities  it came out of precious metals  It was another fairly bad day for the sector  Approaching the closing bell for stocks  COMEX gold futures had lost 3 percent to  1 214 50  Silver plunged nearly 5 percent to  18 77  Copper was also effected  with prices for the industrial metal losing well over 3 percent to  3 0720   In the grains complex  both corn and wheat also fell  At last check  corn futures were down 2 29 percent while wheat had lost 0 75 percent  Movers in soft commodities included cocoa and sugar  Cocoa futures were down 1 17 percent while sugar had lost roughly 1 percent  Overall  it was a fairly quite day in soft commodities in terms of volatility   Bonds Bonds were crushed on the session  driving rates higher  The iShares Barclays 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  TLT  hit a new 52 week low and was last down 3 16 percent to  106 53   Yields on Treasuries late on Friday were as follows  The 2 Year Note was yielding 0 39 percent  Over the last month  the yield on this short term benchmark financial instrument has risen eleven basis points alone  The 5 Year Note yield was up to 1 60 percent  The 10 Year note and 30 Year Bond yields moved aggressively higher to 2 72 percent and 3 67 percent  The yield on the 10 Year has now surged better than 1 percent over the last year   Currencies On the back of the strong payrolls report  the U S  Dollar soared on Friday  At last check  the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish ETF  UUP   which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of foreign currencies  had jumped 1 46 percent to  22 90   The closely watched EUR USD pair was last down 0 67 percent to  1 2831  The USD JPY surged 1 22 percent on the session and the GBP USD lost 1 15 percent  The other significant mover on the day was the AUD USD  with the Aussie dollar registering a decline of 0 83 percent versus the greenback   Volatility and Volume The VIX fell on Friday in response to the rally in equities  The widely watched barometer of volatility expectations was last down 5 43 percent to 15 32   Volume was lighter than normal in the stock market despite significant price movements across asset classes on Friday  Only around 119 6 million SPDR S P 500 ETF  SPY  shares traded hands compared to a 3 month daily average of 144 4 million   Stock Movers Celldex Therapeutics  CLDX  was among the day s leaders after the company initiated a pilot study of CDX 1135 for the treatment of dense deposit disease  DDD   The stock was last up 14 percent near the close of trade   A rally in solar shares sent SunPower  SPWR  to new 52 week highs on Friday  The rally in the solar sector was helped by reports that the European Union and China are close to reaching a deal to cap annual solar panel exports   First Bancorp  FBP   the holding company for FirstBank Puerto Rico  added more than 8 percent on Friday  Although the reason for the activity in the stock was not immediately clear  FirstBancorp was upgraded at Sterne Agee last month and initiated with a Buy rating at Guggenheim Partners a couple of weeks ago   Shares of Stratasys  SSYS  climbed roughly 8 percent on the session  The 3D printing giant recently announced a  403 million acquisition of MakerBot   Dell  DELL  shed around 2 percent on the day after reports indicated that founder Michael Dell and private equity giant Silver Lake won t be increasing their  24 4 billion offer for the company  Shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass  Lewis   Co  are expected to issue their recommendations on the value proposition of the deal any day now   Home builders were hit very hard on Friday in the wake of soaring long term Treasury yields  which will push up mortgage rates  Losers included Ryland Group  RYL   Meritage Homes  MTH   and Lennar  LEN   Losses ranged from 4 percent to slightly under 6 percent for the three stocks   Precious metals mining companies also saw losses on the day  Among the prominent names falling on the session were Barrick Gold  ABX   which lost more than 6 percent  and Newmont Mining  NEM   which shed over 4 percent   World Acceptance  WRLD  plummeted around 12 percent on Friday after the company said on Wednesday that it was unable to file certain portions of its 10 K with the SEC because of unexpected delays in completing its financial statements  The delay is related to additional review and analysis need to support the company s allowance

9724,231239,DELL,Watch These 4 Companies Report  RHT  BBBY  GIS  KMX,opinion,"Red Hat Inc  NYSE RHT   Red Hat    is one of the few remaining companies left to report second quarter earnings  Expectations have edged down slightly since the company reported mixed first quarter earnings in June  Until then  Red Hat had consistently topped expectations on both the top and bottom line while growth soared 
The company is still seeing upside in its Linux Servers and public cloud segments which should drive top line growth over the long term  Demand for product offerings like OpenShift and OpenStack have been positive and will also be key to driving sales  Meanwhile  continued investments and key partnerships with IBM  NYSE IBM   Dell Technologies Inc  NYSE DVMT  and Intel  NASDAQ INTC  will be pivotal in propelling adoption rates 
However  sluggish IT spending and increasing competition are near term headwinds  Cloud computing and IT are heavily concentrated industries dominated by heavy hitters like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   IBM and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   to name a few 
Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   Bed Bath   Beyond    has been one of Amazon s many victims in its historic ascension  As a result  earnings continue to slow down as the company finds new ways to compete through this changing retail environment 
Over the past 4 quarters  earnings growth has fallen below zero 3 times while revenue growth has been flat in 2 out of 4 reports  Sluggish mall traffic  currency headwinds and frequent discounting should keep results in the gutter for the quarter to be reported and futures ones 
Management remains hopeful that its omnichannel investments and the recent acquisition of One Kings Lane will help drive future growth  Fortunately for BBBY  expectations are set so low  similar to Macy s Inc  NYSE M  and Best Buy Co Inc  NYSE BBY   that even the smallest positive surprise Thursday morning will send the stock soaring 
General Mills  NYSE GIS   General Mills    is coming off better than expected fourth quarter that has contributed to the stock s gains this year  Year to date shares are up nearly 13  and 15  in the past 12 months 
Historically  the stock makes its biggest gains between 1 day and 30 days following an earnings report  Both earnings and revenues have been soft lately due to weaker demand and changing consumer preferences 
Processed foods  which is primarily what General Mills sells  have lost favor to organic foods as consumers become more health focused  Greater distribution and an expanding natural and organic product portfolio will help drive long term growth 
CarMax  NYSE KMX   Top line growth has fallen short for the better part of a year and a half  Certain challenges such as high competition and a sluggish used car market have driven this downward trend  CarMax    places a large emphasis on the used car market  which differentiates them from competitors  However  used cars have struggled lately as the new car market sees steady growth  putting a damper on CarMax s overall growth 
Management continues to pursue an aggressive store expansion initiative which they believe will drive sales and help penetrate new markets  Shares are up 5  year to date but historically remain flat following an earnings report ",2016-09-21,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-companies-to-watch-that-report-earnings-tomorrow-200154620,200154620

assets  Institutional investors love this field because of the high margin growth opportunities   I ve found no reason why stocks from the old technology area are so low priced  You can buy some of the major players for enterprise values of 5 10  That s damn cheap if you compare this figure with companies like Coca Cola  There you pay 12 times of the enterprise value  One reason could be that

9748,231263,DELL,Uni Pixel  Exploding Vol  Collapsing Stock  Magic Trick No One Gets,opinion,Uni Pixel  Inc   UNXL  is a production stage company delivering its Performance Engineered Film  PEF  to the display  touch screen and flexible electronics markets  The Company has developed thin film high volume roll to roll or continuous flow manufacturing process  Its focus   to sell its films as sub components for use in liquid crystal display  LCD  as a back light film and active film sub component UPDATE  Getting many sources telling me that the firm is now showing demonstrations of the technology at several conferences   So this one is a really interesting story  aside from the stock and vol stuff  n stuff  It s like a super secret magic trick that no one is allowed to see other than a select group of people who don t seem to agree on what they are seeing  Here s the scoop on UNXL in general and then in particular to day s stock collapse and vol explosion which has put the implied at all time highs  UNXL has a new product called UNI Boss  which is a touch screen technology  Ok    You can see a little video demo of the product on their website    OK    But  check this out One of the most interesting things about UniBoss is that very few people have seen the product outside of the limited presentation environment the company controls  Most investors have just seen the demos on the company s website and a few have visited the company  Almost nobody has actually gotten to play with the demo system and the company has  for about a year  refused to give investors samples     Source  Seeking Alpha via Yahoo  Finance    written by Seth Shaw  I repise this quote   the company has  for about a year  refused to give investors samples   The author of that article goes on to say that they are one of the few to have actually seen and touched this new product and they have really interesting snapshots to demonstrate the usage  UNXL has sub  1MM in revenue but has a market cap of  200MM which at one point very recently was more than  400MM  This is a spec stock on a spec product which could be huge    or not    Let s turn to the two year Charts Tab below  The top portion is the stock price  the bottom is the vol  IV30    red vs HV20    blue vs HV180    pink  On the stock side we can see an entity that was trading below  5  to trading over  41 on 4 17 2013  Since then  the stock has imploded down  55  in a month and a half The headlines driving the recent drops are many  here s a taste May 22  2013Cowen   Co  s Rob Stone this morning reiterates an Outperform rating on shares of touch sensor technology maker Uni Pixel  UNXL   writing that the 26  plunge in the shares Friday was  significantly overdone   prompted  he thinks  by a product delay that doesn t change the company s fundamental advantages Responding to rumors on Friday that a delay in Microsoft s  MSFT  next update to Windows 8  Windows 8 1  might postpone shipment of Uni Pixel s technology  Stone contends that there s no change that he can see to the company s business It is logical for the PC OEM partner to delay a new product launch within months of an operating system update  Nevertheless  investors may wonder if there could also be an underlying issue with UniBoss production readiness  However  UNXL stated that first production samples have already shipped  and a payment from the ecosystem partner indicates continued progress The  PC OEM partner  is not specified  but as I wrote on Friday  analysts have speculated it is Dell  DELL  Source  Barron s via Yahoo  Finance  Uni Pixel  Sell Off on Rumors Overdone  Says Cowen  Position Intact  written by Tiernan Ray The current news  oddly  is    I have no idea   The stock has been falling apparently b c of the above news   worries  And how much is the worry     Look at the bottom portion of the Charts Tab  The red line is the IV30   and we can see how the implied has exploded ever since options started trading in this name  The first day of options trading  12 13 2012  the implied closed at 107   Today  we re looking at nearly 180   In English  the option market reflects nearly a double in the future risk of the firm as the stock price has risen and then collapsed  All on a spec product that basically no one gets to see    It s a magic trick  But it might be a real one   Let s quickly turn to the Skew Tab  below We can see how elevated Jun is to Jul  To me this vol divergence is simply a reflection of the fact that no one has any idea what s going on  We don t get to see the product    There may even be an earnings event in Jul  though it s not a sure thing  There may be more news about the product and its distribution  but there may not be  The stock price drop could be a symptom of short sellers  but it might not be  The stock could pop back to the  40 range or fall back sub  10  or it might stay here  All this in a very short time period Finally  let s turn to the Options Tab  below Across the top we can see the monthly vols are priced to 179 77  for Jun and 153 85  for Jul  The Jun07 weeklies are priced just below 200  vol  So  the option market reflects extreme risk

9752,231267,DELL,Will The Recent Weakness In M A Activity Persist  ,opinion,The volume of mergers and acquisitions  M A  in the U S remains anemic  Even the highly anticipated Dell transaction fell through  In spite of large cash positions on corporate balance sheets  CEOs are not pulling the trigger  Private equity firms on the other hand  are facing declining capacity for large acquisitions   In the past  M A activity usually followed the equity markets  But why not this time around  After all we ve seen the equity markets hit new all time highs recently  The answer has to do with CEO business confidence  which is the ultimate driver of M A  According to Barclays Capital   ask the management of any brokerage company what it takes for M A to increase  and they will tell you it is CEO confidence   And according to the Conference Board  the US CEO confidence has been subdued  Investment bankers at Goldman however  feel that this could all change for the better soon  GS    Global M A volumes in 2013 represent approximately 4  of global market cap relative to the 20 year average closer to 7     A similar dynamic is evident in equity capital markets  IPOs currently represent 20 basis points of global market cap  which is 50  lower than the 20 year average  Activity has varied across the globe  and we have started to see a meaningful pick up in the U S  new issue market    To the extent the operating environment stabilizes and our clients feel more confident  we believe activity could revert to more normalized levels  If half of the gap was closed relative to 20 year average activity levels  M A volumes could increase by approximately  700 billion and IPOs could increase by roughly  50 billion   Those are impressive numbers  Of course it could be wishful thinking on Goldman s part  given the firm is still the largest M A shop and derives a substantial portion of its fee income from these activities  They miss the good old days of the M A gravy train during 2006   2008  For now things don t look too rosy over the next few months  as the current M A pipeline  expected deals  has been relatively weak  If Goldman is right and CEO confidence improves  we may in fact see a pop in activity later this year  But the return to the boom days of 2006   2008 period will remain elusive ,2013-06-04,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-recent-weakness-in-m-a-activity-persist-169910,169910

9773,231288,DELL,US Economy Headed In The Wrong Direction,opinion,As a follow up to yesterday s post about the massive spike in the demand for physical gold and silver since the price hit  I wanted to post some more evidence  This is from an Arab newspaper about the spike in demand over in Saudi Arabia  The crash in the prices of the yellow metal has sparked off a gold rush across Saudi Arabia  In the last three days  gold souks in the Kingdom have come alive with buyers flocking to cash in on the sharp drop in gold prices  Most of the shop owners in the gold souk in Kandra said that their businesses have increased 50 percent in the last three days  whereas those in Balad said sales of 22 carat had gone up by more than 75 per cent and   Here s the headline from a Reuters article  Slump in gold price releases years of   And here s an accounting from a colleague of mine who operates a cash for gold business in Florida and deals with one of the biggest coin dealers in Florida  He s got nada  A guy came in who had ordered and fixed the price on 300 silver eagles last week before the crash and my dealer couldn t tell him when he might get them  My partner ordered three monster boxes last week and paid for them  This week he was told delivery is at least 60 days out   and this dealer is a  hitter   As I ve told people who have asked me how long before the next move higher begins  no one can say for sure  But if you run into people who tell you the bull market in gold silver is over  ask them to sell you some 1 oz  gold silver eagles  And if they don t have any  ask them to go find some let you know where they can offer them to you  Talk is cheap  Talk does not make markets   Markets define  price  when a buyer and seller agree on a price and then make the exchange  Paper markets like the Comex do not define price except in the short run  All a paper futures contract and all an ETF represents is a  promise  to deliver something down the road if you put up the money now  The market is not defined until the promised commodity paid for up front is physically delivered  Given what we know about how corrupt banks are and the Government s unwillingness to prosecute this corruption  see Eric Holder s statement to Congress about a month ago   I would not trust the Comex banks or any of the ETF custodians  except Sprott  to make good on that  promise   As for the economy  I wrote a piece yesterday about more evidence I was seeing that the economy is headed quickly in the wrong direction  About a week ago I wrote an article in which I postulated that  based on some recent company and economic reports  the economy is in worse condition than is being reported by the mainstream media and Wall Street   After my article was written  the Philadelphia Fed released its manufacturing index and it came in much lower than expected  The employment sub index went negative  In addition the leading indicators index was published by The Conference Board  formerly published by the Commerce Department  and it was   1 vs the   2  expected  Also  the Fed s Balance sheet was released and it showed a  67 billion jump in size vs  12 billion the week before  What s the Fed worried about if it needs to print money like this  And today it looks like the Dell  DELL  leveraged buyout deal may be falling through  as one of the big sponsors is worried about PC sales  All the above tells me the U S  economy is in trouble  There s just no way the Government can cut back on spending  which means the debt ceiling debate that pops up in May will likely entail another round of kicking the can down the road  which means even more Treasury debt issuance to finance the deficit spending and even more money printing by the Fed ,2013-04-21,David I.

9774,231289,DELL,M A Bankers Away As Elephant Hunters Play,opinion,With trillions in cash sitting in CEO and private equity wallets  investment bankers have been chasing mergers   acquisitions with a vengeance  Unfortunately for the bankers  investor skittishness has slowed merger activity in the boardroom  Rather than aggressively stalk corporate prey  bidders look more like deer in headlights  However  animal spirits are not completely dead  Some board members have seen the light and realize the value destroying characteristics of idle cash in a near zero interest rate environment  so they have decided to go elephant hunting  During a nine day period alone in the first quarter of 2013  a total of  87 7 billion in elephant deals were announced HJ Heinz Company  HNZ    27 4 billion    February 14  2013   Bidder  Berkshire Hathaway  BRKA   3G Capital Partners Virgin Media Inc   VMED    21 9 billion    February 6  2013   Bidder  Liberty Global Inc   LBTYA  Dell Inc   DELL    21 8 billion    February 5  2013   Bidder  Silver Lake Partners LP  Michael Dell  Carl Icahn NBCUniversal Media LLC 49  Stake  GE   17 6 billion    February 12  2013   Bidder  Comcast Corp   CMCSA  These elephant deals helped the overall M A deal values in the United States increase by  34  in Q1 from a year ago to  167 billion  see    Unfortunately  the picture doesn t look so good on a global basis  The overall value for global M A deals in Q1 registered  418 billion  down  7  from the first quarter of 2012  On a transaction basis  there were a total of 2 621 deals during the first three months of the year  down  20  from 3 262 deals in the comparable period last year With central banks across the globe pumping liquidity into the financial system and the U S  stock market near record highs  one would think buyers would be writing big M A checks as they wrote poems about rainbows  puppy dogs  and flowers  This is obviously not the case  so why such a sour mood The biggest scapegoat right now is Europe  While the U S  economy appears to be slowly but surely plodding along on its economic recovery  Europe continues to dig a deeper recessionary hole  Austerity driven fiscal policies are hindering growth  and concerns surrounding a Cypriot contagion continue to grab headlines  Although the U S  dollar value of deals was up substantially in Q1  the number of transactions was down significantly to 703 deals from 925 in Q1 2012   24    Besides buyer nervousness  unfriendly tax policy could have accelerated deals into 2012  and stole business from 2013 Besides lackluster global M A volume  the record low EBITDA multiples on private equity exit prices is proof that skepticism on the sustainability of the economic recovery remains uninspired  With exit multiples at a meager level of 8 2x globally  many investors are holding onto their companies longer than they would like While merger activity has been a mixed bag  a bright spot in the M A world has been the action in emerging markets  In 2012  the value of global transactions was essentially flat  yet emerging market deal values were up approximately  9  to  524 billion  This value exceeded the pre crisis M A activity level in 2007 by  73 billion  a feat not achieved in the other regions around the globe  Although emerging markets also pulled back in Q1  this region now account for 23  of total global M A deal values Elephant buyout deals in the private equity space  skewed heavily by the Heinz and Dell deals  caused results to surge in this segment during the first quarter  Private equity related buyouts accounted for the highest share of global M A activity   21   since 2007  However  like the overall U S  M A market  the number of Q1 transactions in the buyout space  372 transactions  declined to the lowest count in about four years Until skepticism turns into confidence  elephant deals will continue to distort results in the M A sector  Echostar s  DISH  play for Sprint  S  is further evidence   However  the existence of these giant transactions could be a leading indicator for more activity in the coming quarters  If bankers want to generate more fees  they may consider giving Warren Buffett a call  Here s what he had to say after the announcement of the Heinz deal  I m ready for another elephant  Please  if you see any walking by  just call me  Despite the weak overall M A activity  the hunters are out there and they have plenty of ammunition  cash  DISCLOSURE  Sidoxia Capital Management  SCM  and some of its clients hold positions in certain exchange traded

9776,231291,DELL,The Rise And Fall Of Apple Computer And The Tech Sector,opinion,A sea change is underway for Apple Computer and the tech sector and major dangers and opportunities will unfold as this tidal wave rolls ashore Long before Apple Computer  AAPL  became the most watched stock in the world  a book called The Personal Computer Book by Peter McWilliams was published back in 1982 Apple still makes headlines today but many of the exciting companies  which were introduced to us in The Personal Computer Book  have either died or they have been consumed by other corporations  in the manner that Compaq was cannibalized by Hewlett Packard  HPQ    Kaypro Computer  the manufacturer of a metal encased unit which was as portable as a sewing machine  filed for bankruptcy in 1992  Digital Equipment Corporation  or DEC  was consumed by Compaq in 1998 before Compaq was eaten by HP in 2002  Commodore International  which brought you the Commodore 64 and the Amiga  was laid to rest in 1994 The central character of The Personal Computer Book was a little company in Seattle named Microsoft  MSFT   which developed a  disk operating system  called MS DOS at the request of IBM  IBM  IBM  wanted to start manufacturing a product line called personal computers  Their entire PC line was built around computer chips called  central processing units  or CPUs which were manufactured by a company named Intel  INTC  By 2013  Microsoft  IBM and Intel appear to be heading to the same   or similar   fate as the other companies mentioned in The Personal Computer Book  Worse yet  a company named Dell Computer   DELL  which developed a massive customer base by direct sales of PCs to customers through ads in such magazines as Computer Shopper and PC  now faces an uncertain fate after founder  Michael Dell first announced plans to take the company private  with the assistance of a private equity firm named Silver Lake Partners  As it turns out  the large stake shareholders are not happy with the  13 65 per share buyout price  On August 22  2008   just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers   Dell was trading at  25 50 per share  Dell hasn t been traded for  18 per share since February 21  2012 The fate of the personal computer extends beyond the good   or bad   fortunes of any particular company  At this point in American history  the personal computer is headed for the same fate as the Leisure Suit  It is rapidly becoming antiquated technology Smartphones and pads are replacing the clunky units with their spinning metal disk hard drives  as consumers are increasingly entrusting their most private  personal information  photos and videos  yes   that kind  as well  to complete strangers who operate mainframe computers known as the cloud This sea change in digital technology is changing the entire tech sector from the investment standpoint  Microsoft  MSFT   which just found its way back to  32 per share after spending most of the post Lehman years in the  25 range  with the exception of last year s spring fever  is increasingly becoming a target of ridicule In fact  an online dispute arose at a popular news website after one commentator characterized Apple as  the new Microsoft    Oh  snap   As die hard Apple investors stubbornly clung to their positions while the share price plunged from  702 on September 19 to  390 on April 19  it is easy to understand why The fate of Intel Corporation  INTC  is inexorably linked to the well being of its biggest customers in the PC manufacturing industry  At this time last year  Intel was clawing its way back to  29 per share  These days  you are lucky if you can unload those shares at  22 A good number of investors who survived the dot com bubble  which came to grief in March of 2000  are nervously fretting about what to do with their technology sector shares  Because the entire tech sector rises and falls with the prices of those four relics of the PC era  many see the entire sector as radioactive Which brings the discussion to Apple Computer   AAPL  the tech industry darling which is now locked in a significant bear market as it struggles to maintain its dominance The company s recent earnings report was lackluster  at best  as iPhone sales decline and margins shrink  Apple stock has taken a sharp decline from the lofty peaks in the  700 share range to close on Friday at  417 Numerous brokers have cut their price targets for Apple and now there s a wide range of targets between  400  800 per share The company reported revenues that were better than expected and good sales for the iPad  However  Apple reported declining profits for the year over year period and declining gross margins  Slowing growth is bad news for an innovation leader like Apple and the rest of the world seems to be catching up  with Samsung  SSNLF  pressing them in the phone market and Amazon  AMZN  in the tablet world For tech bulls  PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF  QQQ   This ETF  formerly known as the  Nasdaq 100 Tracking Stock   invests in all of the stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index  which includes 100 of the largest domestic and international non financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization  Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLK   This ETF invests in all of the equity securities of the Technology Select Sector Index in the same proportion as the investments in those companies made by the index itself  For tech bears  ProShares Short QQQ ETF  PSQ   This ETF seeks daily investment results which correspond to the inverse   1x  of the daily performance of the NASDAQ 100 Index  QQQ invests in derivatives which ProShares Advisors believes  in combination  should have similar daily return characteristics as the inverse   1x  of the daily return of the index  ProShares UltraShort QQQ ETF  QID   This ETF seeks daily investment results which correspond to two times the inverse   2x  of the daily performance of the NASDAQ 100 Index  QID invests in derivatives which ProShares Advisors believes  in combination  should have similar daily return characteristics as two times the inverse   2x  of the daily return of the index  A quick look at a chart of QQQ offers insight into the current condition of the tech sector  Apple is losing market share as its iPhone sales grew just 7  year over year while Samsung shipped more than 60 million smart phones in the first quarter  giving it 30  of the global smartphone pie compared to Apple s 37 million phone sales and 17  of the market Apple also issued lower guidance for the upcoming quarter and that it has no new products to release until autumn  another bad news omen for a company that depends on innovation and invention Apple s big announcement during the earnings call was that it s going to give shareholders  100 billion in buybacks and dividends which is a departure from previous practice and obviously an attempt to offset the pain of a a 40  decline in the value of Apple stock The sea change in tech from personal computers to mobile and tablets is accelerating minute by minute and which companies will be winners and which will be losers remains very much in doubt  Key players include Apple  Amazon and Google  GOOG  and  of course  the old line names like Microsoft  IBM  Dell and Hewlett Packard will struggle to stay relevant and not become dinosaurs in this new age For investors  stock picking in this new age could become treacherous  at best  as the battle for survival and supremacy plays out  Here is a list of some ETFs you may want to consider as alternatives to investments in individual tech sector companies  In this chart of QQQ we can see how the index  candlesticks  has been in an uptrend and the blue line of amazon com  nasdaq amzn  closely tracks the direction of the QQQ index  However  we can see how the black line of Apple  nasdaq aapl  stock prices has wildly diverged from the overall sector  Apple makes up a significant percentage of the weighting in QQQ and so it s unlikely that this divergence can continue  It s very likely that either Apple will have to rally or that QQQ will decline to a point where the two are again in synch with each other  Bottom line  In today s world  the rate of change will only continue to accelerate as mobile and tablets and the cloud crowd out PCs  mainframes and semi conductor based computing products  Picking individual winners and losers will be a gamble  at best  however  tech index ETFs like QQQ and PSQ will offer investors opportunity to profit from both the rise and fall of the tech sector tide  Disclaimer  The content included herein is for educational and informational purposes only  and readers agree to Wall Street Sector Selector s     and  before accessing

9783,231298,DELL,4 Stocks To Snap Up On Low Price to Cash Flow Ratio,opinion,Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  ratio as one of the key metrics This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better  One of the important factors that make P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company s liquid assets  It gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and also consider price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening American Axle   Manufacturing Holdings  Inc    NYSE AXL    which designs  engineers  validates  and manufactures driveline  metal forming  powertrain and casting products  carries a Zacks Rank  2  It has an expected EPS growth rate of 8 1  for 3 5 years and delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1 4  in the trailing four quarters  You can see  Daqo New Energy Corp    NYSE DQ   has an expected EPS growth rate of 29  for 3 5 years and pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 15 3  in the trailing four quarters  The manufacturer and seller of polysilicon and wafers carries a Zacks Rank  2 Dell Technologies Inc    NYSE DELL   designs  manufactures  sells and supports information technology products and services globally  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 12  for 3 5 years General Motors Company   NYSE GM   designs  builds and sells cars  trucks and automobile parts worldwide  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and expected EPS growth rate of 8 5  for 3 5 years  The company delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters at an average of 20 5  Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test  It can all be done with the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting

9788,231303,DELL,Mergers And Market Tops,opinion,A prominent feature of the stock market recovery since 2009 has been the declining trading volume trend  NYSE trading volume has visibly diminished over the last four years after reaching a climax in March 2009  see below chart   To many savvy investors this is a negative sign which forebodes disaster  A declining volume trend suggests a lack of broad based participation  and while it s true that this is detrimental to the market s long term health  the dynamics of today s market have changed from that of yesteryear  A market can rally on declining volume for weeks  months or even year at a time without seriously jeopardizing the market s forward momentum  What s the reason for this anomaly The reason for this can be found in an understanding of liquidity  When the Federal Reserve unleashed its easy money policy four years ago  it opened the floodgates of liquidity which allowed the equity market to bounce back from the credit crisis  Some of this money was channeled into the financial market via institutional trading  but much of it was used by corporations for stock buybacks  dividends and  more recently  corporate mergers and acquisitions  This explains how the bull market to date has been a volume affair  cash rich companies have been the driving force behind it  taking the place of broad participation among individual investors  As Randall Forsyth observed in the latest Barron s   It s more likely that the oceans of liquidity loosed by the world s central banks and sitting idly on corporate balance sheets spurred the burst of deal making   Examples include the  23 billion acquisition of H J  Heinz by Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian firm 3G Capital  Comcast s  16 7 billion purchase of the 49  of NBC Universal from General Electric it didn t previous own  Dell s  24 billion proposed leveraged buyout  the  11 billion merger between bankrupt AMR and US Airways Group  and the  16 billion merger of Liberty Global and Virgin Media   All told   writes Forsyth   some  160 billion of M A deals have been announced so far in 2013  the fastest start to a year since 2005  according to Dealogic data cited by the Wall Street Journal  But doesn t the increasing wave of mergers harbinger a major top  Historically  feverish merger activity does tend to coincide with major equity market peaks and this time should prove no different  The devil is in the details  however  In other words  timing is by no means an easy affair if M A activity is your sole guide  A more practical solution is to incorporate technical analysis along with market psychology and other reliable guideposts for the timing of the market s inevitable top and use the M A boom as merely anecdotal evidence that we re getting close to one  Just be sure and leave plenty of leeway for the  whipsaws  that are sure to come between now and the time of the final  hard down  phase of the deflationary long term cycle It s my contention that 2013 will prove to be a topside transition year in much the way that 2007 was  You ll recall that 2007 showed a similar level of M A activity  and this presaged a major top which was confirmed the following year  The low NYSE trading volume of the last four years  supported as it has been by corporate buybacks and consolidations  can only keep the rally alive for so long  The 120 year cycle bottom in late 2014 should provide the finishing blow to this by allowing deflation to take its ultimate course against the Fed s feverish attempts at creating artificial inflation GoldThe latest CFTC data show that traders have reduced long positions for gold prices by 56 percent since last October  Sharps Pixley also points out that the volume of gold backed ETPs has declined 0 9 percent this year  Hedge fund manager extraordinaire George Soros reportedly cut his holdings in GLD ETFs by 56 percent in Q4 while Moore Capital liquidated all its GLD ETFs  Consider also the latest technical development for gold and the gold ETFs  for only the second time since 2001  the 450 day moving average has been decisively broken by the gold and gold ETF price lines  What s so important about this event you may ask  Unlike the last time the 450 day MA was violated  briefly  during the 2008 credit crisis  relative strength for gold was increasing at that time  Moreover  trading volume expanded noticeably during the 2008 violation of the 450 day MA  which indicated both capitulation on the part of retail traders and heavy accumulation on the part of  smart money  investors  This time around there is no such increase in relative strength  but rather a decrease in relative strength  Trading volume has also diminished rather than expanded The following chart is courtesy of Don Hays Market Advisory  Hays pointed out the relevance of the recent breakdown below gold s 450 day trend line in a recent market commentary  He has always referred to gold as the  Fear Index  based on his belief that the price of gold is primarily function of investor risk aversion at the expense of equities  Below is a graph showing the relative strength for the iShares Gold Trust ETF  IAU   As you can see here  relative strength for the gold ETF has been declining for some time  which doesn t exactly inspire confidence in the outlook for gold right now The implication is that gold is still in an intermediate term bear market which will require a polar shift of both investor sentiment and money flow in order to reverse it 2014  America s Date With DestinyTake a journey into the future with me as we discover what the future may unfold in the fateful period leading up to   and following   the 120 year cycle bottom in late 2014  Picking up where I left off in my previous work  The Stock Market Cycles  I expand on the Kress cycle narrative and explain how the 120 year Mega cycle influences the market  the economy and other aspects of American life and culture  My latest book  2014  America s Date With Destiny  examines the most vital issues facing America and the global economy in the 2 3 years ahead  The new book explains that the credit crisis of 2008 was merely the prelude in an intensifying global credit storm  If the basis for my prediction continue true to form   namely the long term Kress cycles   the worst part of the crisis lies ahead in the

9789,231304,DELL, Se Frustration  Medicine Tough To Swallow,opinion,Over the last few years  the Washington D C  fear du jour has migrated from debt ceiling to elections and now from fiscal cliff to sequestration  A better term for the  85 billion triggering of automatic spending cuts  sequestration  may be  se frustration   due to Congress s annoying inability to agree on a responsible approach to reducing our country s burdensome debt and deficits  The forced cuts getting crammed down our government s throat taste like bitter medicine  especially when the economy is limping its way back to a slow recovery  revised 4th quarter GDP growth of a meager  0 1    Although the  1 2 trillion in cuts over 10 years may gag growth to an intensified slowdown  the good news is that the cuts will assist with the long term health of the economy   even though most reasonable people agree there are more appropriate medicinal regimens to be offered   The Se Frustration   Sequestration Breakdown  As you can see from the pie chart above  the  85 billion in spending cuts  small slivers  associated with the sequester represent a relatively small fraction of our country s total  3 6 trillion federal budget  More specifically  the expenditure reductions equate to a meager 2 4  of 2013 s total spending tab How is the  85 billion in painful spending medicine being administered  If Congress continues with this flawed solution  more than half of the cuts    43 billion  will come from defense spending  see also Impoverished Global Babysitter   For the balance of the cutbacks  discretionary spending is bearing the largest brunt of the austerity moves    29 billion   The main discretionary programs hit include scientific and medical research  national parks  education  food inspections  federal employee pay  law enforcement  grants to state and local governments and the Head Start pre school program  Notable exceptions to the reductions include military personnel and Social Security beneficiaries  To a lesser extent  Medicare dollars will decline by about  10 billion  and a final miscellaneous mandatory program category will drop by approximately  4 billion   Before despairing  let s put this se frustration into better perspective  While  85 billion sounds like a lot of dough  the fact of the matter is our government is still running a  1 trillion deficit  i e  spending   tax receipts   Even if we chose to have 10 sequestrations today  our country would still be running a deficit  see chart below    While the  85 billion in se frustration pills taste bitter now  this far from ideal medicine will improve our fiscal health nonetheless  The elephant in the room remains our graying Baby Boomer population and associated explosion of Medicare costs   Checkbooks Open as Merger Mania Materialize  Corporations have been flush with trillions in cash over the last five years  but due to the uncertainty surrounding our economic recovery  CEOs  Chief Executive Officers  chose to keep their short arms out of their deep pockets  As we entered 2013 that mindset has begun to change  The inherent drive for companies to grow sales  earnings  and cash flows has finally surpassed the fears of contraction  uncertainty  and recession  How do we know the mindset has changed  One need look no further than the roughly  300 billion in deals announced in the first 60 days of 2013  Here is a partial sample of the higher profile transactions    Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  BRKB  and private equity partner 3G Capital agreed to buy ketchup maker H J  Heinz Company  HNZ  for approximately  23 billion    Dell Inc   DELL  has offered a private buyout out of the company for  24 4 billion  thanks to a private equity partner and a  2 billion stake from PC partner Microsoft Corp   MSFT     Office Depot Inc   ODP  offered to buy OfficeMax Inc   OMX  for  1 3 billion in stock    Comcast Corp   CMCSA  is buying the 49  share of NBCUniversal it doesn t already own for  16 7 billion from General Electric Co   GE     American Airlines parent AMR Corp  AMR and US Airways Group Inc   LCC  approved their  11 billion merger    Anheuser Busch InBev  BUD  is in multi billion dollar discussions to buy Mexican beer brands from Constellation Brands  STZ     Oracle Corp   ORCL  agreed to buy Acme Packet Inc   APKT  for  2 1 billion    Hormel Foods Co   HRL  closes  700 million Skippy peanut butter acquisition from Unilever PLC  UL     AT T  T  has agreed to acquire 700 MHz B band spectrum from Verizon Communications  VZ  for  1 9 billion    Avis Budget Group  CAR  announced acquisition of Zipcar  ZIP  for  500 million    Shell Royal Dutch  RDSA  agreed to buy LNG Assets from Repsol for  6 7 billion  including the assumption of debt   As you can see  the multi hundred billion M A boom of 2013  mergers and acquisitions  has been on a tear  The fear surrounding executive board rooms has subsided  so the hunger for growth should be strong enough to keep the checkbook out and available for future company purchases   Cornucopia Corner Here is a short list from an abundant set of stories over the last monthPope Retires  Pope Benedict XVI is resigning

9790,231305,DELL,Coming M A Boom Will Not Cure Economy s Real Ills,opinion,Behind almost all of the economic problems we are now facing is the need for economic restructuring  The world needs to move on and politicians and others are fighting to keep things as they are  To me  this is one of the reasons why the common liberal Keynesian solution to our current difficulties is more government spending  more stimulus  The common refrain is to push things right back into where they were  Push people back into construction jobs  push workers back into the auto plants  and push the untrained into information technology  Unfortunately  the world has changed  We cannot keep trying to push people back into the jobs they once held  or  push people into jobs they have not been trained for  Everyone is excited about the boom in   I have been among those  like James Less  Vice Chairman of JPMorgan Chase   Co  who said   The Goldilocks era of post crisis M A has never been an if  but a when   For two years or more  I have been writing that the larger  better off companies  the larger money managers  are just waiting for the right environment to begin the acquisition binge  In terms of high profile the Dell  DELL  deal kind of kicked things off  In the past two weeks  there have been at least four major deals announced  These have included the Dell buyout  the Comcast  CMCSK  acquisition of GE s  GE  stake in NBC Universal  the acquisition of American Airlines  AAMRQ PK  by US Air  LCC   the Berkshire  BRK B  3G Capital acquisition of H  J  Heinz Co   HNZ   and the Liberty Global  LBTYA  proposal to takeover Virgin Media  Inc   VMED   Each deal is worth more than  10 billion  But  note  these transactions will not necessarily add to economic growth   at least  not immediately  Big deals like these result restructuring  layoffs  plant consolidations  and so forth  These transactions transform industries  modernize them  and economize them  To me  the key word here is  restructuring   The world has changed  Consequently  the economic structure we have been working with needs to be re structured  We need to go through this restructuring in the United States  Right now  however  we are seeing this scenario play out in the eurozone  Europe  in the middle of cries to end the austerity  Fears abound that Silvio Berlusconi and his populist party may get elected in Italy and block needed but unpopular reforms that have been proposed by the current government  France is wavering in the face of negative economic growth  And the other countries in the periphery of Europe wallow in stagnation  The recent figures  the growth rate in France was negative 0 3 percent  in Italy growth was negative 0 9 percent  in Spain growth was negative 0 7 percent  and even in Holland  growth was negative 0 2 percent  The basic problem across the board is that the economies of these countries are just not competitive  And  further fiscal stimulation is not going to make them competitive  Fifty years or so of fiscal stimulation has gotten these countries where they are today  You cannot just keep putting economic resources back into the jobs that are not in existence any more  Gillian Tett  in the Financial Times  quotes    The competitive problems in France are horrible and current policy is making this worse   The same goes for Italy  Greece  and Spain   and others  Tett adds   What worries many American investors are the long term structural challenges that are sapping growth   These American investors are looking toward Europe to find more attractive yields  What is true of Europe is also true of the United States  After 50 years and more of government sponsored credit inflation  artificially stimulated economic expansion as a policy of the government  America needs to restructure  When under employment runs around twenty percent or so  when capacity utilization in manufacturing peaks at 80 0 percent of capacity or less  and when real economic growth seems to run under 2 0 percent per year  something needs to change  We cannot just  goose up  the economy over and over again with more and more credit expansion  Doing so just unbalances the economy leading to predictions like those of Bain and Company that in 2020 we may have a  90 trillion real economy  but we may also have created  900 trillion in financial assets to achieve this size  If this isn t credit inflation  I don t know what it is  But just   goosing up  the economy is not going to really reduce under employment or raise capacity utilization in manufacturing  We have seen that over the past fifty years  credit inflation has just exacerbated these problems  not reduced them  Restructuring is painful  That is why politicians can play off this pain to get elected   and re elected  And  nothing sells better than  I will see that the government spends more money to put you back to work   and  I will see that you get more credit to buy your own home  even if you are unemployed  because every American should own their own home  And  constructing more homes creates jobs   My view of the future is that this is not going to change  In my view this is the environment we are going to have to live within   and invest within  A world of badly needed restructuring  Now  I need to be careful here because I also see an environment of inflation   credit inflation  But  not all credit inflation comes out in an increase in prices  at least those prices included in the consumer price index  The prices included here are flow prices  prices of groceries or clothes or rents on houses  Credit inflation can occur in other ways that don t impact these flow prices  For example  the price of houses is not included in the consumer price index  The price of commodities is not included in the consumer price index  The price of stocks is not included in the consumer price index  Bubbles can occur in these  stock  prices  And  recent publications by Bain and Company  in the scenario discussed above  predict that  bubbles  could occur more frequently going up to 2020 and also be more volatile  These  bubbles  may not necessarily be included in the consumer price index depending on what prices they impact  Furthermore  we have seen that credit inflation can result in the pyramiding of financial assets  Securitization of mortgages  credit card debt  auto loans  and so forth result in one structure of finance building on another  Money market mutual funds  alternative financial firms  collateralized debt obligations build up a pyramid of finance with little or no impact on the economy or on the consumer price index  How can all this finance take place with little or no impact on the consumer price index  Just look at the 1990s and the 2000s  And  then the financial collapse came  With little or no change in attitudes in our politicians or in the electorate or in popular opinion I believe that it is highly likely that we will be in the world envisioned by Bain and Company   a world of credit inflation ,2013-03-04,John

9793,231308,DELL,Will 2013 See Record Valuations For Middle Market Business Sales ,opinion,Business owners time their exits for many reasons  health  retirement planning  availability or lack of family successors  competition  technology change  and many more  Yet  overwhelmingly  the question we are most often asked as a financial advisor to entrepreneurial companies is   What s my business worth  All things being equal  a rational business owner will presumably choose to sell at a point of optimal value for his or her interest in the firm  For the reasons outlined below  we believe that the next eighteen months may see the highest pricing for good middle market companies in the thirty years I have been in the M A advisory business Historically  the market for mergers and acquisitions is one of the most volatile on the globe  In our experience  the market is very cyclical with three to four years separating peaks and troughs and six or seven years to cover a full cycle  The last bull cycle for M A peaked in 2006 2007 and the market trough was witnessed in 2009 2010  Moderate improvement was witnessed in 2011 and 2012  with Q4 2012 being particularly strong  2012 was FOCUS s best year since 2007 Barclays and Business Insider 2013 started with a bang with large announced deals for Dell  Heinz  and Virgin Media just to name a few   these are not isolated deals and 2013 will witness a resurgence in M A activity  While the M A market could be derailed by a major decline in the equity markets or further chaos in Washington  we believe the odds favor a strong market for sales of middle market companies through sometime in 2014  By then a correction will be overdue and the likelihood of a cyclical bear market in equities may become increasingly high  Generally  a serious decline in the stock markets leads to a precipitous fall in M A activity  The next 12 to18 months will almost certainly be a highly favorable period for business exits  If this proves to be a cyclical market top  the next favorable period for businesses owners wishing to sell may not come around before the 2020s  In 2020  today s sixty six year old baby boomer will be seventy three and today s fifty eight year old will be sixty five and studying Medicare options  2012 Middle Market M A Values Back to 2006 2007 Highs In 2012  FOCUS witnessed a strong recovery in sell side M A values  with seven closed sales and average pricing above seven times EBITDA  Several recently issued reports indicate our experience was consistent with the overall market  For example  GF Data Resources  which tracks middle market M A values based on data provided by more than two hundred private equity firms   that for deals in the  10 250 million range    Valuations averaged 6 2x trailing twelve months  adjusted EBITDA  the highest mark in five years  Among major business categories  health care services and technology set the pace  both with average valuation multiples in excess of 7x   We again are seeing heated bidding wars and multiples exceeding 10x for great companies in hot industries  One important driver for the valuation jump in the middle market is an increase in total leverage available from a range of 2 5   3 25 times cash flow immediately following the 2007 08 recession to a 2012 range of 4 4 75 times  Companies with steady  highly predictable cash flow are seeing leverage multiples of up to 5 times cash flow and even more for companies with EBITDA over  20 million  As a result  sponsors were able to reduce their equity commitments from the fifty percent range typical in 2010 2011 to a range of 35 40 percent of total capital in 2102  Financial Market Liquidity Could Drive Values to Historic Highs With their various QE programs  the world s central bankers have created a tremendous overhang in global financial markets  Individual investors have begun to grab for yield  pushing  junk  bond yields to levels formerly reserved for A rated credits  Thomson Reuters LPC reports that leveraged lending for private equity backed deals reached  70 billion in 2012  a hair s breadth shy of the 2007 record of  71 billion  Private equity funds are aggressively pushing to fund finance companies and other direct lenders that were previously off limits to all but a few specialists  PE firms  limited partners are even creating their own direct lending teams to enhance their yields  There should be a great deal of leverage available to support PE M A deals in 2013  Bain and Company has  that global capital assets will grow to  900 trillion or approximately ten times predicted global GDP for 2020 of  90 trillion  The chart below predicts a financial market pyramid that most readers will find quite frightening   Bain suggests that this capital overhang will result in more frequent bubbles forming in particular asset classes as wealth managers race toward particular sectors which they believe promise stronger than average yields  We expect middle market M A is a likely sector to experience a rapid increase in asset allocation this year and this should be reflected in a move to record sales multiples for many companies over the next eighteen months  In discussions with a number of wealth managers  we hear a consistent refrain   Over the past decade the endowment funds that ventured early into alternative assets have achieved superior returns  We are recommending that our clients increase their allocations to alternative assets and particularly to private equity where the endowments have witnessed their best performance   This recently was confirmed in a study commissioned by Mergermarket in a report entitled   Based on interviews with 100 active private equity limited partner investors  the Mergermarket study reports   According to the LPs interviewed  private equity has successfully rebounded from the crisis  and is positioned for a strong 2013  Nearly half of respondents say that their PE investments have surpassed their expectations and  of those who plan to adjust their allocation to private equity within the next year  the overwhelming majority  95 percent  expect to increase the amount apportioned to the  private equity  asset class    of commitments that must be invested in 2013 or lost  Since fund management fee income is directly proportional to committed funds plus investments  failure to use this money would have very negative consequences for many PE groups  Thus many of these funds will find themselves under tremendous pressure to do deals  even if they find that doing so requires an increase in their valuation expectations  The biggest wild card remains the banks  which have become more aggressive in their pricing  but have not yet returned to the wild days of the mid 2000s in terms of leverage and coverage ratios  Should they do so   Katy bar the door   we may be in for a wild ride indeed  Even without the banks  the  to fund cash flow based loan facilities and other growth capital funding may be sufficient to drive leverage multiples higher  Should the PE firms react to the new influx of LP investments with an increase in equity allocations to their deal funding  the stage could be set for a lively auction market that pushes middle market purchase multiples to levels never before seen  How Should Business Owners React  Many middle market businesses that were hurt by the crash and 2007 08 recession now have three years of solid performance and growth under their belt  These are the types of results that private equity firms crave  The owner of such a firm who is ready to sell based on non market factors should take action yesterday to get into the market  There is room in the pipeline for now  but by mid year we expect most of the players in the M A market  from the investment bankers  the PE firms  and their lenders to the lawyers and accountants who drive much of the timing should be getting very busy  On the backside  the one thing we know about M A cycles is that no matter how strong the market  once the tide recedes  it is often years until it rises again  Miss this window and you may have a very long wait for the next one  Those owner s whose ideal time frames are a bit longer  say three or four years out  should give serious consideration to sale today  If the current cycle resembles the past  the middle market M A boom predicted here may likely peak between late 2013 and midyear 2014  By then  the Fed will likely have begun to tighten credit  resulting in a rise in interest rates  which normally makes leveraged deals far less attractive  Another presidential election will be looming and the next change of power in America carries a great deal of risk for the capital markets  The equity collapse around the 2008 election had the effect of depressing the M A market for an extended period  There is a real risk that there may be no three to four year window for business owners wishing to sell  If history repeats  the current favorable window could shut within one to two years at the outside and most likely not reopen until the 2020s  Finally  for the business owner with a longer horizon  this market may present a unique opportunity for growth through judicious acquisitions  The 2020s promise to be an era when many of the technologies now taking root  including personal robotics  bio engineering  nano technologies  and artificial intelligence coalesce into a period of global prosperity unimaginable to most observers beaten down by the steady drumbeat of depressing news  For those business owners who share that optimism  the current market presents an interesting dichotomy  while middle market companies with steady and increasing EBITDA in excess of  5 million are enjoying record valuations  many smaller firms still sell for much lower multiples  Many companies have found their capital bases depleted after several years of struggle and are handcuffed when it comes time to resume their growth  Many of these firms will find it necessary to team with a larger  better capitalized acquirer to reach their full potential  Thus  we are seeing a number of companies that have been on the sidelines for several years begin to open their purses to acquire smaller firms that fill in gaps in terms of product line  technology  personnel  or distribution chains  The next 24 months should be interesting indeed  Whether they ultimately choose to sell or grow  business owners who ignore current trends in the M A market are running a significant risk of missing opportunities that they may not see again for many years ,2013-03-07,John Slater,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-2013-see-record-valuations-for-middle-market-business-sales-158157,158157

9811,231326,DELL,Microsoft  HP  Amazon  Next Tech Firms To Be Taken To The Woodshed ,opinion,Apple  Welcome to the World of  Commoditized Products  The luster is finally falling off of Apple  AAPL   and in the end they were just a hardware provider  who provided products which will easily be commoditized as we noted previously  Every spike in Apple will be heavily shorted into as margins compress for the next 4 years plus to eternity  Research in Motion  RIMM  says  Welcome to my world Apple  your hell is just beginning    If Apple couldn t blow out numbers with their signature product  in their holiday quarter with an imploding stock price  forget about it  it s all downhill from here for one of the most overvalued stocks of all time   Tech Graveyard   Where Supposed Growth Stocks Go To Die  This sets the stage for a couple of other stocks that are about to face the music as the earning s season picks up speed  It was a nice strategy to buy Hewlett Packard  HPQ  after the tax selling season finished  and push it up with all the other dog stocks of 2012 including Dell  DELL   RIMM and many others  A nice strategy when everything else has been pushed up to extreme valuation levels  and much harder to push up nearly as fast  Wall Street must have all gone to the same investing conference again  as there was coordinated buying of a bunch of loser  barely alive firms that nobody in their right mind would own for the long haul and they were run up 10  15  and 20    HP   The Entire Company Needs to be Written Down  This brings me to HP  which fits in this category nicely  just a complete abomination of a company  HP is in danger of going bankrupt at the pace they are descending into the mismanagement spiral known as buying a bunch of dead technology firms  and actually make these acquired firms even more obscure and obsolete  I have seen all I need to see with HP  there is no chance Meg Whitman turns this company around  She will be gone in a year at most  one way or another  At any rate  I could go on forever with a litany of issues regarding what s wrong at HP  this company is going to get crucified in earnings after the run up in the stock since the beginning of the year  HP is not a value stock  it falsely masqueraded as a growth stock under Mark Hurd due to the illusion of acquisitions which HP overpaid for  and has become a bloated wasteland of dinosaur technology  I predict at least a 6  Butt kicking after earning s release Microsoft and Windows 8Next up another dead tech company in MSFT  Need I say more than Windows 8  Really  This is the most mismanaged company given its resources in the S P 500  As long Steve Ballmer is at the helm of this firm the stock will be a serial under achiever Good thing you went to Harvard Steve  as you have to be the only CEO who could manage to do so little with so much  and still keep a job  even as you let competitor after competitor pass you by in every new technologically innovative business  It isn t even worth my time discussing this company any more  Needless to say  this is where growth goes to die  and where Apple is headed right next to DELL  in the land of dead tech companies whose best business idea going forward will be determining the size of the dividend for shareholders to keep them interested in these stocks before they become completely obsolete Amazon   The Next Apple to Fall from GraceNow my favorite overpriced  oh excuse me Jeff Bezos  misunderstood over valued tech company is Amazon  ticker symbol AMZN  I think this  misunderstood  company has consistently missed earning s expectations for the last two years without fail It must be nice to be given a free pass on performance for the past two years  but this earning s report will be different as Amazon is priced for perfection  and if there is one thing Amazon isn t  it is perfection   Yes  I know the investment thesis  but this is just all marketing crap  The same principle of Amazon coopting BestBuy s customers applies to Amazon as well with the world wide web  Margins will be coming down for any commodity provider on the web   I understand this company quite well  and given the run up in the stock  expect a nice 8  ass kicking come earning s report in a few days  time   Technology  Shrinking Margins and Increased Competition   Ergo  these are three tech firms that are going to be taken to the woodshed this earning s season now that the run to 1500 for the S P 500 is over  results matter  and these three tech companies are either complete no growth dogs  or over priced retailers   Frankly  I wasn t impressed with Google  GOOG  or IBM s  IBM  earnings  one missed and the other was in line  but I guess we just had to make a run at 1500 now didn t we  But one thing is for sure  there are no cheap stocks right now  Moreover  there are a lot of companies that will be seeing their fair share of  profit taking  over the next couple of weeks of earning s season as performance is measured against the run up in the stock price   There are a bunch of over valued companies masquerading as growth companies due to ridiculous valuations that just don t match the underlying fundamentals of their respective business models or the economy at large

9817,231332,DELL,Real Time Data Extremely Bullish  Unlikely To Last ,opinion,God bless the United States of America is how many a politician speeches have ended  And indeed  God certainly must be blessing us  just look at the stock market  Right now  surprisingly  everything seems to be coming up roses  particularly those key metrics that determine what is really going on   The first surprise is that corporate buying has picked up dramatically  I had thought that net corporate selling would continue and surge into February  Instead  there has been almost  40 billion of new corporate buying announced over the past week  led by the  20 billion Dell  DELL  leveraged buy out  The second related surprise is that corporate selling remains lighter then we had thought   Therefore recent corporate activity has been extremely bullish  Is this spike in buying a one   off event  Could be  The Dell deal has been worked on for quite some time  But then again there have been at least three other billion dollar other cash takeovers   I am also surprised that we are still seeing positive inflows into both mutual and exchange traded US equity funds  My opinion had been that inflows were boosted directly and indirectly as a result of higher 2013 tax rates and would stop by the end of January  Instead  February equity flows still are positive  although nowhere near the huge inflows of January  Lastly and perhaps the biggest surprise  at least to me  is that withheld income and employment tax payments were still up over 6  year over year the past two weeks through early February   Those of you who have been regular followers of my blogs know that I had been expecting wage and salary growth to be slumping by now as a result of higher 2013 tax rates pushing lots of taxable income into 2012  I also had been saying that higher employment taxes this year would lower take home pay   Well  despite higher taxes and 2013 income being recognized in 2012  wage and salary growth is not slowing  Why  I have no idea  I called my favorite official senior Washington economist  who has been a friend and confidential source since the late 1990 s  He also has no answer as to why there has been no slowdown in wage and salary growth   Remember  there are always inadvertent consequences to major government actions such as boosting top bracket income and capital gains tax rates for 2013  In anticipation of the year end rate hikes  over  100 billion in extra income poured into the economy late last year  That boosted what normally comes in during December by about 20   The spike in income means that tax collections have also surged  It is no surprise that the US government can now tout that the deficit could be less than  1 trillion this year  Of course for that to happen wage and salary growth needs to stabilize at these high levels  something I think is unlikely  but then again  we are in uncharted territory   One possible reason for the current spike in wages and salaries could be another inadvertent consequence of the tax hike  And that is that the year end income surge has had a ripple effect on the economy  Another possible reason for the gain is that business owners decided to take in 2012 more than just regularly scheduled income  bonuses and dividends  They also may have raided the cash from their business balance sheets  assuming that higher rates are here to stay   I ve discussed before how the new mantra in the financial markets is that central bank money creation is all good  and the belief that  therefore  that nothing bad can happen anytime soon to the global financial markets  Add to that the strengthening of the US economy   The results  It seems likely stock prices will keep going up over the near term   The bigger question is not whether reality has been suspended forever  but for how long  Take home pay right now is growing by about  400 billion annually  How can the US keep creating  1 trillion a year to pay our bills  The current US deficit will be  17 trillion soon  not counting Federal Reserve debts of  3 trillion  The Fed will supposedly sell its bonds in the market place after the economy picks up  Where will a US economy that generates  7 5 trillion in after tax income get enough money to not only pay off Fed holdings  but  17 trillion in government debt  Below you may find the video ,2013-02-07,Charles Biderman,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/real-time-data-extremely-bullish,-unlikely-to-last-154364",154364

9834,231349,DELL,Ignore Washington  Focus On Market Fundamentals ,opinion,As the 4th quarter  2012 winds down and with all eyes focused on Washington  it has been a better year for stock and bond returns than many expected  The S P 500 is up roughly 15    16  year to date  and the Lehman Aggregate will end the year with an increase of 4    5   approximately   In terms of S P 500  and per ThomsonReuters   the  forward 4 quarter  estimate for S P 500 earnings is now  108 91  down slightly from last week s  109 09  and towards the lower end of the 3 month range of  107 89 from Sept 28th  and  112 from October 5th  This pattern is typical of how earnings estimates  evolve  during a quarter  The forward estimate tends to get revised downward through the quarter  and then we will see a nice  pop  in that forward estimate as we roll into the first week of January  as the old quarter rolls off and we add the next forward quarter to the estimate  With 3rd quarter  2012 financial results all but reported  497 of 500 companies have reported their 3rd quarter  2012 results already   the calendar 2012 earnings estimate for the S P 500 is  101 38 as reported by ThomsonReuters  7 estimates   and I would expect that to drift a little higher as the 3rd quarter results are finalized  and the 4th quarter starts getting reported in early January  Thus  the S P 500 is trading at 13 x  those forward earnings expectations  Last week  Jeff Miller  the erudite blogger who authors  A Dash of Insight  every week called me out on my comment that I thought the S P 500 was  fairly valued   When I look at S P 500 earnings growth expectations for this year and 2013  year over year growth for S P 500 earnings is expected at 4  in 2012  and 10  in 2013  and if you average the two you arrive at 7   A 13 x  multiple on the S P 500 currently is roughly 2 x  the average growth rate of the two years  so on a P E to growth basis  the S P 500 is thought by some to be  fairly valued   As a smart lawyer once said   I can argue it either way   but like a lot of folks in this business  I tend to think the risk   reward in terms of asset allocation is more favorable to stocks  more reward  than bonds  more risk   This  from Brian Wesbury  First Trust s excellent resident economist from November 5th  2012 makes a compelling case for the US stock market  The Washington discussions have thrown a temporary wrench into market forecasts and have resulted in economic predictions ranging from Armegeddon to cautious optimism  I hear a lot of recession talk about 2013 that guys like Jeff Miller and Doug Short have shot considerable holes into over the last 12 months  starting with the August  2011 market selling  Even though I don t personally agree with the tenor of the discussions coming out of Washington regarding higher taxes  I just don t think 2013 will be that bad  unless the President really loses all perspective about America and Americans  and their willingness and ability to want to get out of bed each day and control their own destiny economically  Ultimately  I think there will be a reasonable compromise from Washington and the taxation issue  and Americans will get about  the business of business  in 2013  Each week  in this opening section  we like to leave readers with a  stat  or stats  of the week  and this week we look at equity market returns across the various market cap ranges and investment styles  What struck me is that this has been a fairly unform year for most equity investors  even as money continues to flow out of actively managed equity funds   Source  JP Morgan s Weekly Market Recap as of 12 17 12  Large cap Value  16 2  Large cap Blend  14 9  Large Cap Growth   14 1  Mid Cap Value  16 5  Mid Cap Blend  15 3  Mid Cap Growth  13 9  Small Cap Value  14 2  Small Cap Blend  12 7  Small Cap Growth  11 2  From the data  I would attribute a slight edge to larger cap and a slight edge to  value  over  growth   The biggest return disparity is between small cap growth and large cap value  which is a 5  difference   I wonder how much of that disparity is Apple  AAPL     long AAPL   Sector   Security   Market comments    Muni s had a tough week   the Municipal Bond ETF  MUB  looks to be in the early stages of a breakdown  see chart below   Note the  double top  in the chart from February and then late November  We have sold all of our muni exposure and have left the proceeds in a municipal money market waiting to see what happens  It could be interest rate related  but I suspect that the tax exemption that favors municipal bonds might be on the table in 2013 as Washington looks for additional revenue  Here is  from November 17th that details our early comment on munis    How bad was Citi s downgrade of Apple  AAPL  this past Monday morning  only to see the stock finish higher on the day  Analysts are pulling in AAPL s 2013 and 2014 earnings estimates as they did in last year s December quarter  only to get caught with AAPL s outstanding earnings report in Jan  2012  Is past prologue  Hard to say  but it sure looks like AAPL is basing here  It has absorbed a lot of selling and negative commentary and NOT broken that November  12 low near  500  The stock remains cheap at 7 x  4 quarter trailing cash flow  ex cash   In last year s December quarter  AAPL grew revenues 73  year over year  after growing just 39  in the September quarter of 2011  Not one of our world class brands i e  Coca Cola  KO   Nike  NKE   Procter   Gamble  PG   Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  trades as cheaply as AAPL  right here and now  even though AAPL has substantially higher revenue and earnings growth   Long all those stocks just mentioned   There is still that  gap  on AAPL near  425  from the January earnings report that worries me   those technical gaps tend to get filled    Ford  F  finished strong on Friday  December 21  and closed right at its high of the day on 2 x  average volume  Some of our value stocks are getting a push late in 2012  One of our worst sales this year was Applied Materials  AMAT   a value stock  at  10 15  now trading over 10  higher  AMAT also closed Friday on good volume   Long F     Our PC sector call in early October  here is the link  was too early  and wrong   but we took our first positions in Dell  DELL  and Hewlett Packard  HPQ  this week  in a long term  patient account  These are small positions to start  and we ll buy more Dell at  9 80    9 85  and and more HPQ after we see the stocks base  I think the PC sector is more about job growth than tablets  While tablets will cause some market share erosion  as will the Cloud  there is too big of an installed base of PCs to say that the Windows  MSFT    Intel  INTC  platform is completely dead  We haven t owned Hewlett  HPQ  since the late 1990s  2000  I like Meg Whitman  but she has been buffeted and rocked by one problam after another  Even  stability  would help Meg and HPQ today  Also  I think the Windows 8 re design to touch from the mouse and GUI will simply take time for corporations to adapt to  and get comfortable with in terms of training their employees  The Windows 8  touch  couldn t have come at a worse time for the sector  but that is opportunity for those that are patient    Financials  Meredith Whitney finally came around to our conclusion here that financials are a good bet  even in 2013  We ve been blogging that   given the 2013 estimates for the financial sector  the stocks look like they have more upside than downside  However  Elizabeth Warren was put on the Senate Banking Committee  and she is no friend of the banks  Some think they will be  essentially  regulated utilities  for years to come  I m not that negative though  Essentially the banks are a tangential play on the housing recovery and a lending recovery  while the proprietary trading revenue is gone from the income statement   Not sure how much of the big bank s earnings prop trading represented   If nothing else  with the death of prop trading  the financial sector estimates become more stable  and stable might be  better  in 2013   Long JPM  WFC and GS     Good week for Goldman Sachs  GS

to 1 384 and the Dow futures are down 226  to 12 770 thanks to the lack of anything resembling an agreement coming from Washington after Friday s market close  After hours futures prices can be pushed around pretty easily given the lack of liquidity  so the action that will really count will be Monday morning s futures as we near the opening bell on 12 31  Per ThomsonReuters  the  forward 4 quarter  earnings estimate as of Friday  December 28  was  108 83  down from last weeks  108 91  and at the lower end of the three month range between  107 89 and  112 from early October Thus  the S P 500 is trading at a little under 13 x  forward estimates  for a projected 10 8  S P 500 earnings growth rate in 2013 2012 was better than a lot of folks thought  given the volatility in 2011  Here is an analysis by S P 500 sector on the earnings growth expectations for 2012 as of Jan 1  first column   and then the actual earnings growth rate for each sector as of 12 28 12  second column   Finally the

when incorporating dividend A couple of observations on the above data   Every sector saw earnings growth expectations get revised lower as we progressed through 2012  as 2012 s y y earnings growth for the S P 500 was the lowest since 2008   The correlation between the SPRD ETFs and the S P 500 earnings growth rates  can be distorted by market cap  e g  the XLF is all of the mega cap banks  The SPDR ETF s annual returns do not correlate or match precisly the actual returns by sector for the S P 500  given the stock selection and the weightings for the SPDR ETFs   Basic Material s earnings got whacked pretty hard in 2012  but surprisingly the XLB ETF was up 10  on the year thanks to Monsanto   MON   the XLB s largest single stock at 10  of the ETF  MON looks to be up about 32  year to date  not bad for a sector where earnings growth has been revised considerably lower   down 22    in the last 12 months   Healthcare did well  thanks in part to the resurgence of large cap pharmaceuticals stocks  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   Pfizer  PFE  and Merck  MRK  are 32  of the XLV and the top three holdings in the ETF   Long JNJ  MRK  PFE So what are the current S P 500 consensus earnings estimates by sector for 2013  Consumer discretionary   14 Consumer staples   9 8 Energy   3 9 Financials   16 Health Care   6 8 Industrials   8 5 Basic Materials   21 8 Technology   12 5 Telecom   21 1 Utilities   0 9 S P 500  10 8   Based on current estimates and expectations  the S P 500 is expected to generate 10 8  earnings growth in 2013  same as 2012 started out  2012 s earnings growth will likely end up near  4    5    Basic materials is expected to generate the highest earnings growth by sector in 2013  which would be a complete reversal of 2012 s drop  Consumer discretionary  financials  tech and telecom  are all sectors expected to grow earnings faster than the S P 500 in 2013 Telecom is expected to show the 2nd fastest rate of growth in 2013   21 1  as estimates stand currently   Energy has seen the sharpest decline in the past 3 months in terms of expectations for 2013  from 7 8  as of October 1  to 3 9  as of Friday  Financials is the only sector to be revised higher for 2013  from  12 6  on October 1 to  16  as of Friday  12 28   Energy might continue to struggle in terms of earnings growth in 2013  if the US continues to find more supply   Our three largest sector overweights in client accounts remain the same  Technology  Financials and Industrials  We managed to avoid utilities this year   thankfully  although the no weight and underweight hurt us last year Financials were the pleasant surprise in 2012  and I would speculate Industrials could be the pleasant surprise in 2013  given the recent resurgence in China  Japan and Europe Try and ignore Washington  there will be some kind of a deal  and I suspect tax reform will occur gradually over 2013  We still think S P 500 earnings bottomed with q3  12s  0 1  year over year growth rate  and that year over year growth will gradually get stonger as 2013 unfolds Market Sector Security update    One of our best sales this year was Best Buy  BBY  in June  at better than  20 per share  We managed to eke out a gain in client accounts on BBY  and yet  given their cash flow  I never thought the stock would sink this low  We recently bought some Dell  DELL  and Hewlett Packard  HPQ  for a longer term patient account  Both DELL and HPQ are about as cheap  actually cheaper  on a cash flow basis as BBY was  when we bought it  We have tight stops on both stocks  The recent low of  8 69 on DELL where it traded in mid November is one such stop   11 35 is the other stop for HPQ  The PC sector is being left for dead  and maybe that is the right place for it  but the headlines are now overwhelmingly negative for the sector  and I just dont think the PC is going away immediately  The valuations on DELL and HPQ are almost Armegeddon like  DELL is trading at 0 30 x  4 quarter trailing sales  i e  price to sales   1 x  cash flow  excluding the balance sheet cash   about 1 5 x  free cash flow  again when excluding balance sheet cash from market cap   0 20 x  entrerprise value  EV  to sales  and 3 x  enterprise value to cash flow  DELL has an 18  free cash flow yield  HPQ is trading at 0 22 x  4 quarter trailing sales  3 x  cash flow and 4 x  free cash flow and HPQ sports a 26  free cash flow yield  Interesting that even with the Goldman Sachs upgrade of Dell  it is HPQ that showed margin improvement in the 3rd quarter  even though DELL s margin continued to slide   Long GS  DELL  HPQ   Limit your risk with these stocks  but the valuations are too cheap in my opinion  We had to buy some recently    We added to Coca Cola  KO  and Merck  MRK  just after the holiday  a great technician we follow  Gary Morrow   on KO this week that was too compelling to ignore  KO is the classic defensive stock  and in this market  defense wins championships    Ford Motor F   what a run this stock has had   13 is a key technical level  a price level in the first quarter  where it was rejected numerous times  In Jan  12  Feb  12 and then March  12  Ford hit and was rejected at the  13 04   13 and  13 05 levels before getting crushed through the summer  One of our  dirt cheap  value stocks  in 2012  we remain long F  The cash flow valuation of 5 x  automotive cash flow is too cheap to ignore  as the balance sheet will continue to improve  and the company saw a record automotive pre tax operating margin in Q3  12    Ford s  F  stock lagged most of the year  but as of Friday s close  and excluding the dividend  the stock is up 20  in 2012  all of that return coming in the last 45 days of the year  Could it be a play on the European recovery  Absolutely  but we own F because it is selling better quality cars  that Americans want to own  while the foreign OEM s run into problems  i e  Toyota  TM    Success brings its own set of problems    Alcoa  AA  was another of our dirt cheap value stocks coming into 2012  for the year  excluding the dividend  AA is flat on the year  closing at  8 65 on 12 30 11 and ending at  8 50 on 12 28 12  Monday will be key as to whether AA can close in the green this year  No question it will underperform the S P 500  Trading at 75  of tangible book value  AA is a deep value play  The problem is margins for the aluminim smelter  every quarter since June  11  AA has beaten revenue estimates by 3    4   The problem is the company can t generate earnings from the better than expected revenues  Aluminum inventory is an issue too   thought to be about 3 x  current demand  versus copper inventory which is much more in balance and prone to an inventory deficit  thus AA is  or was  being neglected for Freeport McMoRan  FCX   A resurgent Chinese economy could help the price of aluminum  Still long and still wrong on AA    Our equity portfolios are probably 70  value stocks and 30  growth stocks  within the overall 60    40    70    30  asset allocation mix  Our growth names include Visa  V   Starbucks  SBUX   Amazon  AMZN   and Google  GOOG    Long all mentioned    To conclude the weekly missive    Norm Conley with a tweet on income tax receipts  Because of the ideological and political rift that has split the country in half  our conservative clients seem to get angry when i say that despite Washington  there seems to be an underlying strength to the economy  As a young analyst in 1992  after Bill Clinton was elected promising wealth re distribution  socialized healthcare and higher taxes  I was amazed the market continued to trade higher in 2003  I remember thinking at that time   Let the market tell you where it wants to go    a maxim I forgot in 2007 and 2008 as earnings estimates were climbing  It has been almost 13 years since the S P 500 has made a material new high  despite the outbreak of capitalism around the globe  Eventually Europe will right itself  Forward earnings estimates today  are just a touch higher than where they were in July 2008   108 versus  102    103  Something will break us out of this long  flat trading range  although I cant say we wont drop 10  before that happens  Wall Street predictions are notoriously bad  and no one person  firm  style  strategy  or fund is consistently right about the future  unless you are Bernie Madoff  Final point  the 10 year Treasury hasn t made a new low in yield since late July   12  Interesting that with the late week Cliff worries  we still didn t see a huge Treasury rally  The Municipal Bond ETF  MUB  is still weak and below its 200 day moving average  Something happening in muni land for sure ,2012-12-30,Brian

9836,231351,DELL,Apple Price Target   50 Stock By 2016,opinion,Downtrend Still Intact  It is official Apple is one weak stock right now  It is supposed to be a tell when the market is up  and your down considerably to the tune of 3   The Jim Cramer tax selling notion can now be dispelled as well  This is the new year  and for Apple shareholders the misery of the third quarter is repeating itself After a bump up with the entire market at the beginning of the year  a 300 point rally can lift a lot of boats  the sellers loved that entry point to reassert this stock on the downtrend it has been on since the 700 dollar level   So what is really going on in Apple  What are the reasons for this Wall Street darling losing favor to such a degree  Where is this stock ultimately heading in regards to a price target  These are some of the things that I am seeing with the fundamentals of the Apple business model  Apple Doesn t Make The Best Phone Anymore  Apple doesn t unquestionably make the best smartphone anymore  The Galaxy3 by Samsung is at worst case on equal footing with regard to the Apple I Phone 5 smartphone  and depending upon what features you covet in a smartphone  the Galaxy3 is even better for watching Netflix movies or playing games with its much bigger screen Timing really hurt Apple because the Galaxy3 came out 8 weeks earlier  and all those subscribers who could have looked at the I Phone 5  went into their local Verizon or AT T store and fell in love with the beautiful Samsung Galaxy3 The Galaxy3 made all other phones  including all the latest offerings from the other brands look old and antiquated  It really stood out aesthetically by comparison  Yes it had the Apple ahh factor  And once those subscribers bought the high end phone  they are locked up for at least 2 years with their new contract  and Samsung sold a lot of Galaxy3 smartphones  in fact they had a blowout quarter  Rate of change  Another point to bring up is the rate of change  or how fast all of apple s competitors have closed the gap  and in Samsung s case have surpassed Apple in some aspects of the modern smartphone with better technology and features  Apple revolutionized the Smartphone with their first iteration  but if you have an old I Phone it looks like something 20 years old  it is a dinosaur  Apple went from being an unquestioned leader to just one of the best in less than 5 years  time  If we extrapolate this pace going forward Apple will not even be among the top 5 smartphones on the market in three years  time  Everyone knew that in the end Apple made a commodity which was easily duplicated  and it s not like they didn t borrow tons of features from other device makers who created much of the technology previous to Apple getting into the market  So if Apple can go from not even being in the market to the best phone on the market in two years  the barrier to entry is pretty low  i e   there is very little first mover advantage in this market judged by how fast the technology is reinventing itself  In other words  today s leader can be tomorrow s also ran faster than Moore s law can bat an eye  When a market is this lucrative  and this much cap ex goes into research and engineering by competitors with a relatively low barrier to entry  no creative team can rest on their laurels  Law Of Diminishing Returns  In the end though Apple is running into another law  the law of diminishing returns  There is actually very little that distinguishes any of the smartphones anymore  they essentially all have the same specs  capabilities  and their styles are even merging  In fact  have you seen the latest Blackberry offering  it even looks like a cool phone  My first thought when I saw the Blackberry10 was wow that looks like an I phone  So the category has matured  all the low hanging fruit features wise has been picked  and the phones are basically being commoditized as we speak Moreover  an older Android phone that people can get for free from their carrier is so much better than even the third iteration of the I Phone by Apple  If you put these two offerings side by side  the I Phone 3 looks old and antiquated  that s how fast the rate of change has occurred in the industry  So any differences between phones will become less and less as they all converge onto the best features  almost like evolution and how certain characteristics are selected for in nature  and all the birds on a certain island have the same bright colored feathers because it originally provided a reproductive advantage over the competitors  Even Apple borrows from Samsung  and started making their screen larger  In other words  all the best features get selected  and converge into one standardized  commoditized product  And given the price point  one brand cannot ultimately distinguish itself to any degree like high end automobiles  i e   Porsche can differentiate itself from BMW  and Ferrari can distinguish itself from Porsche or Aston Martin  The smartphone has converged and become commoditized  and is only going to continue to be commoditized  and the real story here is that this equates with lower and lower margins as prices always come down during this phase  I think that s why Apple all the sudden started selling their phones at Wal Mart and distributors were discounting the items because Apple overestimated the demand for their product  and they had a lot of supply to unload on the market  Therefore  Apple s margins per phone are definitely going down  Plus I think Apple realizes they cannot just put out one new phone a year while Samsung is putting out 5 and expect to continue to remain relevant in the industry  So they are probably trying to produce more new phones per year  and that means lower margins as well  They are trying to cut margins and hope to make up for it with an increase in overall market share  But unfortunately  stocks get punished on Wall Street for bringing down margins  And usually this is just the start of a long margin contraction process  i e   Dell and Intel  Overvalued Market Cap  Apple was way overvalued when their market cap was more than 3 very large fortune20 companies  that should have been a huge red flag to investors to get the heck out of this stock  The numbers just don t add up for what is essentially a glorified hardware provider  I know Apple markets themselves as more than this  but that is all marketing hype  They may be a creative and stylistic device maker but in the end they are in an industry which is one exemplified by compressing margins and prices  In other words  the technology industry is a genre where prices and margins historically compress once new technology is introduced and becomes adopted by the masses unlike education or healthcare where prices continue to escalate higher  Product Cannibalization  Apple s products cannibalize themselves  nobody needs to buy an IPOD for digital music when a free smartphone can carry all of your music that you will ever need whether at the gym  or waiting at the Doctor s office  No real need to have another duplicative device  Tablets eat into Apple s Laptop and mac sales  and the problem with that is one category will suffer but Apple still has the sunk costs of two product creation cycles  so in the end both product lines never maximize profits for the company  They end up with more overall sales  but much higher development and manufacturing costs that eat into overall company margins  Is Apple Toilet Next   And finally  I know Apple diehards are pinning their hopes on Apple inventing a new category like Apple TV  but Apple is running out of areas to create an entire new product genre that revolutionizes the way society utilizes a given device  And their stock priced in this element during the 5 plus year run up in the stock  and that is one hefty  deflate cycle  yet to be fully priced into any valuation models  that Apple will no longer be able to invent a new product category that captivates the entire nation and has Steve Jobs on the cover of Time magazine for person of the year  That has all been priced into Apple s stock  that premium coming out of Apple Stock is one bearish component to be weighed by future investors looking for value in Apple  The farther Apple stretches outside their core competency  the more likelihood for a complete mishap  and they end up creating a blowup  engineering failure  product  that actually loses money for the company  Crowded Trade  The crowded trade effect of Wall Street  remember five years ago when RIMM was a Wall Street darling  and a huge momentum stock by all the fund managers  Every fund manager had to have RIMM in their portfolio it was a given  and that stock split  kept going higher  and on and on Each year there are 10 large stocks that most of the fund managers get into  and four or five that every fund manager must own  the momentum stocks for the year  And whether it is NFLX  or CROX  or MCP it is great when you re on the right side of the momentum play  but when the party ends  the rush to the exits takes forever  and is one nasty fall from grace   The problem is that valuations become so distorted that Apple at  500 looks like a discount  appears to be on sale  a big value trap waiting for unsuspecting investors  But mark my word  there may be earnings surprises  and good quarters along the ride  but every jump in the stock will be sold into heavily  and the stock will continue to put in lower highs and lower lows as margins compress  and investors look for better opportunities in other areas Eventually  400 appears in sight  then  300   200   100 and my target of about  50 a share as the company reaches the Microsoft  Dell  Hewlett Packard  and Intel phase of a maturing Tech Company  Apple better have a hefty dividend by then or  50 will not be the bottom for this aging dinosaur  The End Of Cheap Money  And finally  there has been a lot of cheap money on Wall Street for the last three years that played a large part in Apple s lofty share price  well the era of cheap money is coming to an end over the next three years  This capital contraction means all asset classes that were supported by the fed will be receiving a haircut with regard to the previous golden era of effective zero percent borrowing costs  But especially a momentum play where investors could borrow money cheaply  invest in a stock that was on a right trending graph where stops were easily moved up to lock in profits  and reduce risks considerably  all this will change in the next era of the tightening cycle  All stocks will get hit to some degree  but the high flyers with amazing exponential stock runs like Apple will get crushed more severely on the downside of this change in monetary policy  This is why my target of  50 is probably much lower than most investors can possibly imagine right now  and almost laughable from today s perspective  But I am trying to be ahead of the curve  not in the past or present  but what trends  and market dynamics are going to play out over the next three years of an investing cycle as many investors are investing for much longer term than just on a yearly basis  The Tech Graveyard  So be careful when it comes to buying Apple stock hoping for a value play  Sure Apple can be the exception to the rule  they can even reinvent themselves like IBM  but if we use the last decade as our guide most of the technology high flyers come back to earth in a very humbling way   In fact  Apple  themselves has already exhibited this cycle once in their history during the early stages of their development  The percentages are definitely against them beating the odds and becoming a perpetual high flyer  the more likely scenario is one of a mature tech company that offers quality products to loyal consumers  and pays investors a healthy dividend to justify the lack of future growth opportunities  and declining margins  The tech graveyard is replete with examples of former tech darlings that now reside in this category  And this may be an overly optimistic endgame for Apple  there are much worse scenarios once the slide starts feeding on itself  Sony was once thought to take over the world  and be unstoppable  Things change fast in the technology world

9842,231357,DELL,A CEO s Search for Market Efficiency ,opinion,One of the longest running MBA discussions is on whether capital markets truly price a security at its intrinsic value  Whether you believe in market efficiency or not  erratic stock prices make it difficult for publicly traded companies to manage for the long term  CEOs and Boards must balance its efforts between quarterly earnings targets and long term planning for company sustainability  As most already know  these generally come in conflict  So how can companies effectively manage these two opposing forces   First off  earnings don t mean as much as market expectations  In an illustrative example  let s say a company projects earnings of  10 per share and trades at the market P E multiple of 15 for a  150 stock price  If the company misses earnings by  1  the stock not only drops to reflect this miss  but also does the P E multiple oftentimes  If the multiple drops to 12 in this example  the stock falls to  108  12 x  9   What s interesting is that of the  42 drop in price  only  15 of it relates to the drop in earnings as the remainder results from a lowered expectation about the company s future  An earnings miss means problems on the horizon to the market  whether or not it is actually true  What s even worse  events or speculation outside the scope of a company s performance can affect the price significantly  Ironically  while management teams almost solely focus on delivering on the financial budget  it is often outside forces such as an analyst upgrade or downgrade that really moves the price  So CEO s shouldn t worry about earnings or the stock price  right  Of course they must  CEO pay is often tied to stock performance through options  equity grants  and other forms of compensation  And if he or she can t deliver the short term earnings expected from analysts  the CEO won t be around to benefit from some of those packages  but we can t lose sight of those healthy severance packages   It seems counter intuitive for shareholders to reward short term results when a properly executed long term vision should matter more  but patience is not a characteristic of the stock markets  Bottom line  CEO s are expected to deliver every quarter and build a sustainable future with long term stock appreciation at the same time  A few companies have been able to deliver both  Jeff Bezos  charisma and Amazon s  AMZN  sales growth allows it borrow at  and command a high P E despite an unproven earnings record  Google s  GOOG  search engine business continues to blow out earnings allowing it to invest in self driving cars and computing eyeglasses  While very few have a cash cow like Adwords  even declining companies such as Intel  INTC  and Cisco  CSCO  can leverage their balance sheets and cash flow stability to delve into riskier investments that might produce a better future for them  Building a day to day story still is step one  Financial transactions are a common way that companies attempt to influence stock price dynamics  but with mixed results  Companies that buyback their own stock do so at the highest prices  Dividend payouts are good  but the market places little value on them  and can in fact lower stock prices due to reduced growth expectations of the company   Many companies from Burger King to most recently Dell look to going private transactions as a way to generate value  These transactions are usually highly leveraged and have other issues that may or may not make the concerns stronger in the long run   Investments in innovation and new companies are another way to look to the future without impacting current results  Spinoffs like Microsoft s  MSFT  home grown Expedia  EXPE  and EMC s divestiture of VMWare  VMW  were not only financial home runs  but also allowed these new ideas to thrive outside of the scope of a larger parent company with different incentives  Incubators such as  support startup ecosystems while keeping the incumbent plugged into developing technologies  Large companies can also benefit from innovation based acquisitions  like Google s Android  to potentially develop a strong pipeline for the future  Certainly there is more variability in the returns on these investments  which markets hate   but there is more upside in the long run   Even if a stock does ultimately reaches its true value in the long run  its hard to chart a clear path to get there when quarterly earnings and outside opinions seem to be all that matter  Perhaps companies need to hire a psychologist to help manage market expectations  Or perhaps companies should just stay on the sidelines like tech companies are now doing according to a  But if a company is poised to remain in the public realm  perhaps they need to develop a poker face by talking eloquently about mundane topics such as capital expenditures on the one hand  and invest in futuristic cars that drive themselves on the other hand ,2013-01-21,Atma Business Blog,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-ceo's-search-for-market-efficiency-151607,151607

9847,231362,DELL,Is Dell Technologies An Attractive Stock To Own After Its Re Birth ,opinion,"The computer hardware sector is not the place to be in when the world s largest economies   the U S  and China   are embroiled in a bitter trade dispute that could derail global economic growth and crimp spending by both consumers and large corporations 
Amid this uncertainty  however  there is one stock which is holding up surprisingly well  And that s the re born Dell Technologies Inc  NYSE DELL   After re listing on the New York Stock Exchange in December  its shares have climbed more than 45   compared with just 9  gains delivered by the close rival  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co  NYSE HPE   Dell stock closed up 0 3  at  66 41 yesterday 

So  what is it that s making investors excited about Dell this time  Dell went private in 2013 to transform its business from a hardware seller to a diversified company which could command a significant market share in the growing areas of the digital economy  including storage  servers  data protection and networking 
Just before its re entry in the public market last year  Dell merged with EMC Corp  NYSE EMC   forming a tech powerhouse with annual sales forecast to touch  95 billion in the current fiscal year  compared with about  57 billion when it left the public stage  At that level  Dell would rank as the fifth largest publicly traded tech company in the U S  by annual revenue  just below Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  
Bigger Dell Is More Powerful
The lynchpin of founder and CEO Michael Dell s strategy has been to create an integrated operations company that could engage customers from one unit to another and drive higher sales and profit  to compensate for Dell s lower margin businesses  The addition of EMC s higher margin data storage business is providing cross selling opportunities  while its 82  stake in VMware  which provides digital infrastructure to over 500 000 customers globally  is adding to its bottom line 
The latest evidence of this strength came yesterday when Dell reported its latest quarterly earnings  surpassing Wall Street s EPS estimates  Helped by strong corporate demand for personal computers and services  Dell s profit rose to  1 45 a share  excluding one time items  from the consensus forecast of  1 20 a share  Sales from the PC unit rose 6 2  to  10 9 billion  while corporate sales surged 13  on the rising demand for its subscription services for PCs 
Dell s bigger size and diversified offerings didn t come without a cost though  Some analysts have raised concerns about the massive debt on the company s balance sheet  which ballooned to  49 billion after its acquisitions  That indebtedness isn t a problem when the sales are rising and the company is making profit  But computer hardware is a highly cyclical business that could face a sharp slowdown if the economy slows or trade tariffs escalate costs for consumers 
In its forecast for fiscal 2020  Dell had warned that sales growth will slow over the next year  hurt by global economic issues that may weaken corporate demand for its hardware products 
These concerns  as well as the company s integration  which is still a work in progress  have kept its valuations depressed  The stock is trading at just nine times the earnings estimates for fiscal year 2021  a discount from the industry s average P E multiple of 14 
Bottom Line
There are more reasons to like Dell stock than to hate it after the company s restructuring and expansion  With its market leading positions in many product categories  Dell s new business mix is much more powerful  It can now withstand the cyclical headwinds better than many of its competitors  who are heavy on the hardware side

9851,231366,DELL,Server Market Decelerates In Q1  DELL  HPE   Others In Sight,opinion,The server market  which was showing signs of recovery beginning 2017  seems to have again landed in troubled waters  After experiencing six consecutive quarters of double digit revenue growth  the market seems to have slackened in 2019 with a single digit revenue rise witnessed in the first quarter Per International Data Corporation  IDC    worldwide server revenues inched up 4 4  year over year to  19 8 billion in first quarter 2019 while overall shipment dipped 5  to below 2 6 million units Going by IDC  revenues of volume servers increased 4 2  year over year to  16 7 billion while the mid range server registered a 30 2  surge to  2 1 billion  However  high end system revenues for a second consecutive quarter showed a steep decline of 24 7  to  976 million Also  IDC noted a 6  year over year climb in x86 server revenues  reaching a value of  18 5 billion  while revenues from non x86 servers dropped 13 7  year over year to  1 3 billion The research firm observed that a decline in demand from both enterprise buyers and hyperscale companies coupled with a tough year over over comparison was an overhang on the growth rate during the reported quarter Although lower unit shipments was a blow  the firm added that higher average selling prices  ASP   courtesy of enterprise s demand for richly configured servers  boosted the revenue growth rate for many vendors How Are the Vendors Poised Dell Technologies   NYSE DELL   secured the top spot in both revenue market and volume share space  Over the last few quarters  Dell has continuously registered year over year growth in server revenues and managed to drastically taper the market share difference with Hewlett Packard Enterprise   NYSE HPE   The reason for this stellar market share growth is that the company has been able to strategically capitalize on expanded opportunities from the EMC  NYSE EMC  acquisition  On the last earnings call  management mentioned weakness in the China market to be a relentless headwind  However  the company s focus on acquiring new customers is likely to boost its top  and bottom line growth going forward  Shares of the company have gained 11 1  in the year to date period HPE earned the second spot with 17 8  market share  The company is gaining traction from its focus on high margin businesses  such as server  storage and IoT among others  In the first quarter  per IDC  HPE witnessed a fall of 10 9  in shipment volume  Notably  decrease in the Tier one server sales poses a challenge to the company  HPE shares have returned 6 7  year to date The third position is a draw among Inspur Inspur Power Systems  Lenovo   OTC LNVGY   and Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO    generating 6 2   5 7  and 5 3  share of total server revenues  respectively  IDC calls it a statistical tie when the gap among vendors is 1  or less Talking of Lenovo  the company expects to strengthen its position in high performance computing and AI and continue to invest in servers  storage and networking  It hopes to see a growing momentum in hyperscale business  courtesy of its unique in house design and manufacturing business model  In the year to date period  Lenovo shares have gained 8 2  Moving on to Cisco  the company has pioneered a network system  which is referred to as the Unified Computing System  UCS   This is a revolutionary blade server system  based on x86 architecture that is transforming data centers  In the last reported quarter  the company noted that its Data Center product category rode on the back of solid growth in both HyperFlex and servers  The Cisco stock has rallied 29 1  so far this year Year to Date Price PerformanceIs There a Silver Lining IDC believes that soft unit shipment volumes can be offset as long as surging demand for richly configured servers supports an uptick in ASP Moreover  we believe  a ramp down in hyperscale spend will be temporary as demand for cloud services is consistently robust  The global server market will steadily grow in the quarters ahead  mainly owing to hyperscale server deployments by cloud service providers There is a huge growth opportunity in the hyperscale server infrastructure space with more and more companies shifting to cloud based services  Moreover  proliferation of technologies  such as big data  artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving demand for hyperscale servers Also  Gartner s latest forecast for IT spending  reflecting 3 2  improvement in 2019  depicts a favorable tech expense environment  which we believe  will positively influence the overall server market in the near term Zacks RankWhile Lenovo  HPE and Cisco carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Dell has a Zacks Rank  3

9864,231379,DELL,Forget  The Cliff   Focus On Fundamentals,opinion,A wise person once counseled that no one can have all the right answers  but you can ask the right questions  and this week I thought that the right question was   Can we have some meaningful deficit reduction  without driving the US economy into recession    If someone shouts  Fiscal Cliff  one more time this weekend  I think I am going to step right in front of a Chicago bus  Now that the election is over  and there aren t 35 different polls to report on  each with their own statistical nuance  the cacophony heard daily on the financial news is now all about  The Cliff  and impending doom  and  Rise Above  and we re all going to hell  and don t just be afraid  but be very afraid  Barron s reports this weekend that now the US economy is SURELY headed into recession in early 2013  As my friend Jeff Miller wrote a few months ago on one of the best blogs written every weekend   occasionally something goes right   Here is Jeff s latest from last week on debunking the recession myth  This week  ThomsonReuter s reports that the  forward 4 quarter  earnings estimate for the S P 500 is  109 90  which is down  0 68 from last week s  110 58 and down almost  2 in just the last three weeks  We dont know how much of that is Sandy and how much is normal operations  With the S P 500 closing at 1 379 on Friday  November 9th  the market P E ratio is 12 5 x  that forward estimate  with S P 500 earnings expected to grow 4  for full year 2012 and 11  in full year 2013  The S P 500 earnings yield as of Friday s close was 7 96    getting close to the record highs from early July of 8 25    If you are a believer in the Fed Model  then the S P 500 earnings yield is significant  particularly when the 10 year Treasury is trading at 1 61    I ll take a pat on the back this weekend as even ThomsonReuters grudgingly came around to our view that 3rd quarter  2012 will be the nadir for S P 500 earnings growth  with this sentence on page 2 of their excellent weekly missive  This Week in Earnings    But even with the negative outlooks by company management teams and analysts  it appears that the 3rd quarter will be the trough in earnings and that positive growth will continue over the next year   We ve been saying this for a quite a while  For the 3rd quarter  2012  as of Friday  November 9th  the S P 500 year over year earnings growth is  0 2  and y y revenue growth is  0 7   Both stats have improved since the quarter started  For our  stat of the week  here is how forward quarters currently look in terms of S P 500 earnings growth from Q4  12   Q3  13  both as of Friday  Nov 9th  first column  and as of July 1  2nd column  Q4  12  5 6   13 9 Q1  13  5 1   8 6 Q2  13  9 1   14 4 Q3  13 11 9   15 9   as of Oct 1 2013  full year   10 9   12 4 While forward estimates are still getting trimmed  the fact is there is still going to be year over year earnings growth  We ve been tracking this data forever   since 2000  and my guess is that q4  12 and q1  13 will be low to mid single digit earnings growth for the S P 500  with q1  13 stronger than q4  12  and q4  12 stronger than q3  12  and then we ramp gradually as we move through 2013 The fact is the S P 500 is still pretty reasonably valued  and pessimism is rampant Here is just a quick rundown of the S P 500 s key valuation metrics P E ratio   12 5 x   forward p e as of this weekend Price to cash flow 9 x    as of 9 30Price to book   2 3 x  as of 9 30Price to sales   1 3 x  as of 9 30PEG  p e to growth    1 63 x  as of this weekend  averaging 2012 and 2013 s expected earnings growthDividend yield   2 3 x  as of 9 30Earnings yield   7 96  as of 11 9The source of some of this data was JP Morgan s Guide to the Markets  published every quarter  What is even more interesting is that on Sept 30th  the S P 500 closed the 3rd quarter at 1 440 or 60 points higher than Friday s close  so some of those valuation metrics cited as of 9 30 look better today Finally  Brian Wesbury had  published on Monday  11 5 if you can take a minute to read through it Trading   sector   market comments November 10th  2012     The S P 500 closed Friday  just underneath its 200 day moving average  The uptrend line off the 2008   2009 recession low comes into play right around 1 350  There should be good support for the S P 500 between the 200 day moving average and 1 350    Wow  did financials get hammered on Wednesday  possibly thanks to the Democratic sweep of the Senate  and the Presidency  and possibly due to Elizabeth Warren winning the Massachusetts Senate seat from Scott Brown  Ms  Warren is a virulent regulationist and a big bank  hater   Ironically  financial sector earnings estimates have been gradually improving since July 1  the only sector to do so  with regularity  What I found even more interesting is that when Maria Bartiromo interviewed JP Morgan s CEO  Jamie Dimon  on Thursday or Friday on CNBC  one of the first things he said was he would reach out to Ms  Warren and extend an olive branch  She will undoubtedly end up on one of the Senate Banking Committee s and could make life miserable for the banking industry  The Boyzz better be prepared to come to Ms  Warren on bended knee  else they are apt to become the next public utilities    We thought financials   given the gradually improving earnings estimates   could be a safe haven for this market  Wednesday was a wake up call  Jim Cramer wrote  or said  he thought Ms  Warren s intent might be misconstrued  I sure hope so    Two favorable signs we saw in the financial sector Thursday and Friday  although it wasn t expected until q1  13  JP Morgan  JPM  received permission to re start their share repurchase program in the 4th quarter  I think that came from the Fed  or one its branches  but it could have been in response to Wednesday s price action in financials  Either way  it was a good sign  Even further  it was read on Friday that Basel III capital standards would be implemented more gradually than was originallty thought  which is another positive sign that the regulators are NOT trying to choke off and over regulate the financial sector and render it impotent    Dimon said in his CNBC interview that JPM would love to buy shares back at below tangible book value  which we figure is closer to  35 per share  and which consensus analysts estimate to be  37 50  I can t tell if that means Jamie doesn t think the buyback is a good spend with the stock at  40 or if he thinks tangible book value is higher than  35  Either way  JPM is expected to earn  5 00 per share in 2012  actually  5 02 per share and up 12  in terms of eps growth   even with the earnings hit this year that was the London Whale fiasco  The stock is still cheap and one of our larger financial holdings for clients   Long JPM     Bespoke noted this week that just 25  of the S P 500 is trading above its 50 day moving average  That is well off the 75  highs hit late September  The sectors that have suffered the worst are technology   20  above 50 dma   utilities  0  above 50 dma   telecom  25  of stocks above their 50  dma  and staples  24  of the sector above their 50 dma   Way ugly in terms of the damage  We think the stock market is nearing a bottom though    The bond proxies like staples  the dividend trade  and higher dividend yielding stocks have been hit pretty hard  It was just a matter of time before that happened though   talk about a crowded trade  Look at Altria  MO    the US portion of the Philip Morris  Pretty oversold here  The risk here for the dividend trade is that dividend income starts getting taxed at  ordinary income  rates in 2013  I suspect  if that happens   it will push a lot of companies into more share repurchase programs than dividend programs   No positions in MO     Ironically  Industrials is the one sector where 50  of the sector is still trading above its 50 dma  probably because the sector has been lagging the S P 500 for a while  This is one of our sector overweights and offers great long term value in our opinion  but you need to be an investor  not a trader  It could be that industrials dont catch a tailwind until mid 2013  if then  depending on how fast China can accelerate and if Europe can just stabilize  We like Boeing  BA  and United Technologies  UTX  and we are looking hard at the other defense stocks although we sold Lockheed Martin  LMT  this week after Wednesday  It was a small position   Long BA  UTX  DE  and a host of others     Starbuck s  SBUX  held in very well this week  after their 10  rally off their earnings report the prior week  No give back there at all  We still like Sandisk  SNDK  too  the NAND flash memory maker  Earnings estimates have been increasing for both companies   Long SBUX and SNDK   trying to add on weakness    This week we hear from more technology and retail companies  we hear from the Pc sector with Dell and Hewlett  HPQ  and we hear from WalMart  WMT  on Thursday before the bell  Home Depot  HD  and Cisco report Tuesday  WalMart  WMT   Applied Materials  AMAT   Dell  DELL  and Target  TGT  report Thursday  The Pc sector is   in our opinion   trading for scrap value  DELL looks to be a better value here than Hewlett  We ve been loyal buyers of DELL PC s since the mid 1990 s and the last couple have been total crap in terms of breaking down   I am writing this on a Dell PC with a defective AMD driver that necessitates that i save this blog post every 30 seconds or so  so I dont lose it  Very frustating  but I hesitate to buy a new one or try HPQ given the state of the business right now    Long WMT  HD  and AMAT    Here is our preview of   The fascintaing aspect to Home Depot is that they havent been opening any new stores the last 3 years   they ve generated prodigious cash flow simply by being a better operator  Kudo s to them  I would love to see some comp and revenue growth though as the housing recovery gathers strength    The PC sector is trading like the gold sector or basic materials did in the 1990 s   unwanted  unloved  and deep value  If you venture into DELL or INTC  you need to be patient    Lastly  a Portfolio manager friend who now tweets regularly with good information  Norm Conley of JA Glynn out of St  Louis tweeted   this week  on bank loans  Bodes well

9866,231381,DELL,Behind The Numbers  A Chat With John Del Vecchio,opinion,John Del Vecchio  manager of Active Bear ETF  discusses his new book   What s Behind The Numbers  John Nyaradi  Hi  everyone  I m John Nyaradi  Publisher of Wall Street Sector Selector  a financial media site specializing in exchange traded funds and global markets  and today I m really pleased to welcome our special guest  John Del Vecchio  John  welcome to Wall Street Sector Selector John Del Vecchio  Thanks for having me back  John John Nyaradi   Great to have you here  John  like always  Whenever I talk to you  I always learn a lot  John Del Vecchio is the co founder and co manager of the Active Bear ETF  That s symbol HDGE  Active Bear  NYSEARCA HDGE  is an ETF dedicated to shorting individual stocks that have fundamental red flags around them  Previously  John was a hedge fund manager for Ranger Alternative Management He co advises a newsletter for Motley Fool and is a chartered financial analyst  Today we re going to talk about John s new book  What s Behind the Numbers   A Guide to Exposing Financial Chicanery and Avoiding Huge Losses in Your Portfolio  It has been well received and has been named Best Investment Book of 2013 by Stock Trader s Almanac So let s start at the top  John  why did you write the book and what can people expect to get out of it John Del Vecchio  We wrote the book in order to help people avoid a big loss in their portfolio  So even though I m a short seller and I trade  it s not really a book about short selling  It gives investors tools to identify companies that they may own that are showing red flags that could be a sign of trouble ahead Our view is that avoiding a big loss is really more important than generating a large gain  If you lose 50  of your net worth  for instance  you have to gain 100  just to get back even and we feel like anybody  whether it s a do it yourself investor or a more sophisticated professional asset allocator  would do well to learn tools and techniques that will allow them to avoid large losses in their portfolio and that s what we do within the context of the book John Nyaradi  Part One talks about the real risk of stock investing  What is the real risk John Del Vecchio  Most stocks are actually losers over time  So imagine we were talking in 1970 s and we were talking about Eastman Kodak and Polaroid and General Motors  Those were widows and orphan stocks back then and now fast forward the clock 30 years and they re all dead money  Then in the 1990s  we had Intel  Microsoft  Dell  Cisco  those were the four horsemen of the internet  They ve now been essentially dead money for the last 12  13  14 years  So the winners from one generation are generally not the winners of the next and in capitalism  in general  you can t have a lot of winners  For every Wal Mart  you ve got 40 regional retailers that don t exist anymore because Wal Mart beat them in terms of distribution  technology  pricing  whatever the case may be So picking an individual stock is a risky endeavor because you re betting on your ability to identify that one company that s going to be a massive success within a sector or in that particular cycle of the market  So that s where it s very dangerous It s also very dangerous in that it depends on really the 20 to 30 year time frame in which you are generating your highest income and your highest savings  If you were investing from 1968 to 1982  chances are you didn t make any money and you probably lost about 70  in real terms just because of inflation  If you were investing during the bull market from  82 to 2000  you probably did pretty well  But the last ten or twelve years haven t been that great So while people talk about stocks for the long run  often they re taking about 100 or 200 year time frames  I don t plan on living 200 years so the twenty years in which I m generating my highest income and savings are the most important for me in terms of securing my future And the odds are just against you for being able to identify the companies that are going to be the next Google or Apple  So we talk about certain warning signs that ultimately will be reflected in a lower stock price  We walk through income statements  balance sheets  cash flow to help you spot these trouble signs before they occur  And I think the best thing about the book is that these are real time case studies that were written and published in real time and then show you what occurred  you know  six months to two years after we had identified these things before the stock actually blew up John Nyaradi  You talk about two common investing themes  dollar cost averaging and buy and hold  and it sounds like you don t endorse either of those too much John Del Vecchio  No  the problem with dollar cost averaging an individual stock really comes from Bill Miller  the famous mutual fund manager from Legg Mason  His mantra was  Lowest average cost wins  And so when stocks go against you  you buy more  The problem is when you own Enron  AIG  Fannie Mae  Freddie Mac  WorldCom  all these companies that were basically bankrupt  and he owned them all  it destroys your performance  So dollar cost averaging during a massive meltdown in the market is essentially putting good money after bad  in our view  Conversely  Paul Tudor Jones is probably the greatest trader of our lifetime and he says that the market tells you fairly quickly if you re right or wrong and so don t average losses but actually build on your winning positions John Nyaradi  Part two of your book is titled Avoid Huge Losses  How do you do that John Del Vecchio  From a long perspective  we want to be value investors  We want to buy a dollar s worth of an asset for fifty cents that has a catalyst that we can foresee that s going to allow that value to be realized  Maybe it s the sale of an asset or the realization that the asset is worth more than it s being carried for on the books  We also show there s real value in having a long short portfolio that can offer a smoother overall return Having some shorts in you portfolio to buffer against the inevitable downturn is really valuable  It seems like the hundred year storm occurs about every three years now John Nyaradi  How do you use charts and what s your favorite chart John Del Vecchio  We rely quite a bit on price and volume and relative strength  So my view is that the technical usually leads the fundamental  You start to see selling in a stock before everybody catches on to the fact that the fundamentals are questionable  That might be reflected in high volume when the company is selling off and little volume when it s rallying  There might be divergences between the price and the relative strength  So maybe the price is reaching new highs but the relative strength is not and that s because an institution like Fidelity  for instance  can t sell a stock in one day  They unload it over a period of time  So that shows up in the patterns of the stock over time It s not just fundamental and not just charts  It s the combination of both that gives you an overall advantage  I think  over most investors John Nyaradi  Let s talk just for a minute about the Active Bear ETF  it is symbol is HDGE or  NYSEARCA HDGE  What are you doing there John Del Vecchio  We choose individual stocks that we think have aggressive accounting or some fundamental deterioration in their business and we short them on the expectation that they might miss earnings or have an SEC investigation or other problems what could cause these stocks to go down in price or at least under perform the market over time  And it s a combination of fundamental and technical analysis that s related to what we discuss in the book  The book is not about the fund but it does give you a flavor of how we actually go about analyzing companies and then trading them once they re in the portfolio John Nyaradi  We re talking here in October  2012  the election is coming  the fiscal cliff is just ahead  What s on your mind right now  What should investors be watching out for  What do you see as risks and opportunities here as we head towards the end of 2012 John Del Vecchio  There s a very high level of bullishness right now among advisers  about 65   and it has never been positive for stocks when that s the case  Volume is falling off a cliff  It s below where it was in 2007  The cash position of individual investors has been wound down quite a bit  So there s really not a lot of cash on the sidelines  The National Association of Investment Managers is essentially fully invested at 75  equity  there s never been a bull market that started at that level  We re 43 months into this move off the lows in March  2009  so it s a very old market And I think that the big catalyst  probably at the beginning of next year  is going to be Europe  I just don t see them solving their problems in 2013 John Nyaradi  Folks  we ve been talking with John Del Vecchio and about his new book What s Behind the Numbers  It is getting terrific reviews and has been named the best investment book for 2013 by Stock Trader s Almanac John is co founder and the co manager of the Active Bear ETF  HDGE  and you can learn more about John and his book  What s behind the Numbers    A Guide to Exposing Financial Chicanery and Avoiding Huge Losses in Your Portfolio   John  it has been a great talking with you today and I know we re all looking forward to talking with you again really soon John Del Vecchio  Great  thank you very much

9868,231383,DELL,SP 500 Now As Oversold As May   12 lows ,opinion,The  forward 4 quarter  earnings estimate for the S P 500  per ThomsonReuters  is  109 61  down from last week s  109 90  but still above the late September low of  107 89  The S P 500  as of Friday s close  is trading at 12 5 x  that forward estimate  for expected 4  year over year earnings growth in 2012 and an expected 10  earnings growth rate in 2013  The S P 500  earnings yield  has risen from 7 96  last week to 8 06  as of Friday  November 16th  and close to the all time high of 8 25  reached in early July   12   is from Josh Brown s blog post found on StockTwits  where Josh laments the fact that only 30  of S P 500 companies are beating revenue estimates  This isn t a new revelation   weak earnings and revenue growth have been telegraphed for the 3rd quarter for some time  since late Spring  early summer  However even the headline seems misleading  per ThomsonReuter s  This Week in Earnings   which is the source for most of our earnings data  39  of S P 500 companies have beaten revenue estimate for the 3rd quarter  as of Friday  November 17th   Josh thought the Q3  12 revenue  beat  rate held  dire consequences  for 4th quarter earnings  We respectfully disagree  While the 39   or 30   revenue  beat  might make for good headlines and hand wringing amongst the bears  the fact is that companies are missing by revenues  per Thomson  on average  by just 1  A good example of this is Wal Mart s  WMT  report this week  WMT missed on revenues for their fiscal 3rd quarter  ALL of the revenue miss being attributable to forex  WMT s consensus revenue estimate coming into this week s report was  115 040 billion  while actual revenues were  113 2 billion  According to Wal Mart s recorded conference call comments  available on the website   exchange rate fluctuations cost  1 7 billion  which would leave sales   ex currency  at  114 9 billion  versus the  115 040 billion estimate   Long WMT   bought more Friday  11 16  Now that roughly 450 of the S P 500 companies have reported 3rd quarter earnings  earnings growth is actually 0   flat with Q3  11  and revenue growth is  0 8   Again  this isn t new news   this slowdown in both earnings growth and revenue growth has been telegraphed for some time So what s the point   This week ThomsonReuters in their weekly issue chatted about Q4  12 earnings  which currently are expected to grow 4 9  year over year  a growth rate that is down from 10  from October 1st 4th quarter earnings reports are always double barreled simply because we see both the 4th quarter results and management s usually use the 4th quarter conference call to issue their first pass at what this year will be 2013 guidance  This year s calls could carry even more weight this year since we will likely have the  fiscal mess  behind us  not to mention the election  so management s will be able to give their unvarnished look at the year without having  hopefully  another looming roadblock or fiscal deadline hanging over their heads  but I guess that still remains to be seen  It is just our opinion  but there seeems to be an an extraordinary amount of pessimism permeating the equity markets these days  and you can actually make the case for pessimism surrounding the Treasury market too   with the S P 500 fallng 7  since the election certainly intensifying that pessimism Stat of the week  one sector that has caught our eye  besides Financials  is Telecom  Just 3  of the SP 500  telco is a small part of the market  Here is the trend in earnings estimates for Telco for the next few quarters Telco   The first column is the quarter  the 2nd column is the earnings growth estimate as of Nov 16th  the 3rd column is the earnings growth estimate as of Oct 1 q3  12   0 2    12   actual q4  12   8 4    4 1   est q1  13   9 5    4 1   est q2  13   15 7    7 9   est Estimate revisions have been positive for the most part for Telco  as they have for Financials  and these revisions look to be carrying out to mid 2013 as well  Hard to say what is driving it at this point  AT T and Verizon have gotten hit pretty hard in recent weeks thanks to worries about dividend income being taxed at ordinary income rates  which has hit the  dividend trade  in a big way the last four weeks AT T and Verizon charts look terrible  Both stocks are trading below their 200 day moving averages  Opportunity   maybe a bounce this week    No positions in either  Bottom line  the S P 500 is cheap  as it has been for a while  relatively speaking  On an absolute valuation basis  it is somewhat attractively valued  but not 7 x  earnings cheap We remain overweight in equities relative to fixed income in clients accounts  We remain overweight technology  financials  and industrials Trading sector market update     This coming week is Thanksgiving week and   at least according to Bespoke   at present the SP 500 and all 10 sectors are trading at least 2 standard deviations below their respective 50 day moving averages  We havent been this oversold on a market basis since May or June of this year  6 months ago  We liked the close for the SP 500 on Friday  above  1358 or the  50 week  moving average  see last week s chart  and even Apple  AAPL  had a big reversal on Friday  trading back above the May 18th low of  522  after sinking to  500 during the day  We added some SPY and a smidge of Apple late Friday afternoon  as well as some other names to client accounts    Lowes  LOW  reports Monday morning before the open  Hewlett Packard  HPQ  on Tuesday  and then Deere  DE  on Wednesday  Earnings reports will be limited as well economic data  which is now being distorted by Sandy  Check out our  for LOW  LOW is a little cheaper on a valuation basis for good reason  The stock has rallied  6    7 since the August earnings report  which we didnt think was very good  Can LOW become the operator HD is currently and can both get a tailwind from the housing rebound     Given how DELL traded Friday  hard to believe Hewlett will be any better  DELL guided lower Thursday night    Which is better today   value or growth   And if Value  with dividends  what about the Cliff   I ve been wondering if this bizarre raindance in Washington won t somehow be better for growth stocks since the capital gain  or loss decision  is strictly up to the investor  timing   rather than a mandatory dividend being paid which could get taxed at a higher rate  over which the investor has little control  Also  will companies with large share repurchase plans relative to dividends outperform vis a vis those companies that are  dividend heavy  and  share repurchase light  since share repo s could be tax advantaged  Inquiring minds want to know   I sure dont have an answer  but i m watching how the stocks are trading  The divvy trade seems to have gotten hammered relative to growth like Amazon  Intuitive Surgical  etc  Don t get me wrong   this isn t a rigorous analysis  I m simpy watching how groups are trading    Long some AMZN  small position in ISRG    We sold some high yield fixed income last week  Trade seems very crowded  Just reducing our overweight and upgrading to the higher end of the junk bond market   Per Bespoke  the MUB  municipal bond ETF  had an ugly reversal one day this week  We took the opportunity on Wednesday or Thursday to sell our municipal high yield and shorter duration muni funds  Could the municipal bond market s tax preference be on the table in Washington   That would be one way for Washington to both generate revenue and hammer the wealthy 1  ers   take away their municipal bond tax exempt income  According to a recent article in the New York Times  the US muni bond market is  4 trillion in size   that is a lot of income that could flow to federal coffers  I started out as a municipal bond credit analyst  and this issue of taxing muni s on par with the  taxable  bond markets surfaces every time the government starts sniffing around for revenue  both under Bush 41 and then under briefly under Clinton  It might have teeth this time   Still love Facebook  FB  under  20  May not see that again  Bought a little this week for more aggressive accounts at  19 99  Not a big position   just trading around the edges   In business school courses for Bond management and Money   Banking  I read about  crowding out  or the government s borrowing demands being so onerous that private capital is pushed out of the market thanks to high rates generated by governemnt borrowing  It is amazing to me with the all the worry about the budget deficit and the Treasury borrowing  how the  crowding out  theory never came to pass  The 10 year Treasury at 1 61  has been a huge boon to Corporate America  since so much debt has been re financed at much lower interest rates over the last 4 years  Corporate America is set up for a very long time  as long as they have been smart enough to issue longer term debt  to finance projects with very low hurdle and IRR rates thanks to the decline in the 10 year Treasury yield  In addition  companies with non investment grade ratings have had some time to refinance their debt and lower their interest costs  which has certainly helped their market  Crowding out never came to pass  The US government has been able to finance everything it needs at very low rates  We rarely hear about this   At least that is how I see it   please tell me if I am wrong    PIMCO s El Arian wrote this week we are about to  get more Fed   Ben has to be pulling his eyes out as fiscal policy inertia has now completely over ridden monetary policy stimulus  No wonder the guy wants to quit   China  great chart from Norm Conley of JA Glynn   Watch Freeport  FCX  and Alcoa  AA  for potential China trades  AA trading 75  of tangible book value  Has gone nowhere for years  though  One of our dogs   Final trades  sold AMAT on Friday  They

9871,231386,DELL,Beware The Sucker s Rally,opinion,The last few weeks have seen a rally in well for lack of better word   crap  Before Tuesday s correction  Research in Motion  RIMM  had risen 37  since just the beginning of this month and had nearly doubled from the low hit over the summer Facebook  FB   the company that may be remembered as the most disappointing IPO in decades  is up more than 36  in just the past two weeks Even Dell  DELL   the perpetually cheap PC maker that has struggled to stay relevant in the age of cheap Chinese competition and from upstart tablets and smartphones  has shown signs of life  The stock is up 13  in just the past week and a half What s going on here  Do investors really see value in these tech disappointments  or is this just the mother of all short covering rallies It s a little of both  Let s take a look at each company separately RIMMResearch in Motion has been a real frustration to me as a former bull  This was the company that invented the smartphone and as recently as a year ago could have remained the dominant player in the corporate market had they played their cards right Alas  they didn t play their cards right  In fact  they didn t really play their cards at all  For the life of me  I can t figure out what the company has been doing for the past two years  BB10    the new operating system that is supposed to compete with Apple s  AAPL  iPhone and Google s  GOOG  Android phones    is scheduled to be released in February of next year  That s almost a year later than originally planned  assuming they meet the deadline  And given the company s recent history  that is not a certainty You almost have to work to screw things up as badly as RIMM did  Even after the company started to fall behind its rivals  it had assets of real value  Its BBM messenger is still the best texting and instant messaging program on the market  and it could have been monetized as a standalone app for sale in the Apple and Google app stores  But it wasn t  and every day that passes it becomes less relevant as its pool of current users dwindles I still see value in RIMM s Mobile Fusion platform  which allows corporate IT departments to manage iPhones and Androids on the equivalent of a BlackBerry Enterprise Server  But there is a very significant risk that the company will fail before they have time to fully develop this RIMM still looks cheap    on paper  It has roughly  2 billion in cash and an estimated billion or so in patents  Backing these out  the value of RIMM as a going concern is currently only about  2 3 billion  A good activist investor could buy RIMM  chop it into pieces  and sell off its parts at a profit  But before that happens  management will probably destroy a lot more value first  It s simply too late for BB10 to save RIMM  A year ago  I think it would have had a chance  But at this point  the company has too much baggage  and they are fighting for turf among the business crowd with a resurgent Microsoft  MSFT    See  Microsoft Will Crush Google  Don t get drawn into RIMM  It s a sucker s rally But What About Facebook My wife and I have a rule of thumb for technology products  Once our respective mothers use it  it s over  This is not to say that the company is going out of business  but its high growth phase is clearly over  When our mothers are using it  there is no one left to join Well  both of our mothers are now avid Facebook users You should take my  Mother Indicator  with a grain of salt  of course  But given that Facebook trades for 40 times next year s expected earnings  my concerns about growth start looking valid  Facebook s profits would have to grow at torrid pace in the years ahead for that valuation to be anything short of ludicrous Zuckerberg and Co  are anything if not creative   ruthless  is another word that comes to mind   and I have no doubt that Facebook will find new ways to monetize its assets  But the company depends mostly on paid advertising  which is not a proven model yet in the world of social media  And rival Twitter seems to be getting more buzz these days Facebook is a  50 billion company with a questionable business model trading at a nosebleed valuation  If you buy it  you are betting big on Zuckerberg s ability to innovate  I m not willing to make that bet at current prices DellFinally  let s look at Dell  Dell is a good company in a terrible industry  They make good computers and laptops  but both are commoditized products  There simply isn t much premium to be charged for selling a  good  PC these days  All of the profit goes to Microsoft  the maker of the operating system  and Intel  INTC   the maker of the processor That said  Dell is ridiculously cheap  even for a seller of a commoditized product  It sells for just six times expected 2013 earnings and for just 0 29 times sales  and at  9 77 per share its price is barely above the crisis lows it hit during the 2008 2009 meltdown There is a lot of bearishness toward Dell for the same reason that there is a lot of bearishness towards Microsoft and Intel  Computers are no longer a growth industry  While I consider them far from  dead   tablets and smartphones are creeping deeper and deeper into territory once dominated by PCs  Investors simply have no interest in owning shares of yesterday s tech darling And herein lies a potential opportunity  Dell is interesting contrarian value play  If you believe  as I do  that there is plenty of room for PCs  tablets and laptops on the desks and in the lives of most consumers  then Dell should have a viable future  And given that no one    as in not a single investor I have met in years    has any interest in owning Dell right now  your downside should be tolerably low If sentiment improves even modestly toward PCs  Dell could be an easy double over the next 12 24 months Dell also has no net debt  a respectable return on equity of 27   and a dividend of 3 4  Disclosures  Sizemore Capital is long MSFT and INTC  This article first appeared on InvestorPlace ,2012-11-28,Charles

9872,231387,DELL,The Innovator s Solution  A Book Review,opinion,The Innovator s Solution is one sequel that doesn t disappoint  Christensen follows up the popular The Innovator s Dilemma  previously summarized on this site   with this new book that helps deepen the reader s understanding of technological disruption in business  It takes a brave man to tackle the seemingly unpredictability of disruption and make it sound like a predictable course of events  But that s what Clay Christensen does  and he makes a pretty good case that there are many elements to disruption that can be better predicted  He discusses various factors of a disruptive technology that companies should identify in order to formulate the best possible strategy  One of my favourite discussions in the book related to the identification of whether an integrated  e g  Apple  whereby it owns both the system s hardware and its software  or modular  e g  Dell  whereby it sources the best available components  approach best suits a business  Christensen argues that this depends on whether the product service has reached a point of satisfaction among customers along a particular dimension   For example  when desktop computers were new and did not have nearly today s performance capabilities  customers were willing to pay for performance and therefore an integrated approach  which is better suited to optimize performance  made sense  As performance improved over time  the performance of PCs grew to become more than most customers required  and therefore a modular approach  and the higher efficiency it brings  started to make more sense  At that point  the criteria by which customers were satisfied shifted from performance to customization and convenience  This is where Dell s integrated approach  not with respect to performance  but with respect to customization and convenience  helped satisfy customers along a new dimension  Of course  Christensen is only supplying another model for the reader to add to his toolkit  A number of examples prove this area is far from a predictable one  even if the theory can be helpful in understanding various dynamics  For instance  Christensen notes  in 2003  the publication date  that  adding even more features and functions to wireless handsets is over shooting what its less demanding customers can utilize   He goes on to predict that a modular handset industry utilizing Symbian s  Nokia  operating system is likely to take hold  When analyzing RIM s dominant Blackberry position  Christensen recommends the company not copy the features implemented by its competitors  It s possible RIM followed this advice  one of RIM s co founders  Laziridis  has spoken about The Innovator s Dilemma frequently   as the company focused on its strength  messaging  while a superior web browsing experience blew them away   To me  Christensen also force fits the model into areas it needn t belong  For example  he argues that Microsoft has taken a disproportionate share of the profit in the PC market because the operating system worked best with an integrated approach as its performance is not yet good enough for customers  I would argue that Windows does more than enough for most users  and that Microsoft enjoys ridiculous profitability because of the network effects of its software  i e  it has a large share  and therefore more better applications are written for it  which serves to increase its share in a feedback loop   Don t let my negativity fool you  however  I m still a big fan of the book  If you enjoyed the first book  as I did  you ll enjoy this one too  If you haven t read the first book  I recommend you    There is  however  some overlap between the two books  Though the first six chapters contain a number of new concepts to help managers understand how to pursue or defend against disruption  the last half of the book appears to draw heavily on concepts already developed in the first one  In fact  it wouldn t surprise me if Chapter 7  which is about the RVP framework  was copied straight out of the first book  as it was that familiar ,2012-12-07,Saj Karsan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-innovator's-solution:-a-book-review-146637,146637

9880,231395,DELL,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Williams Sonoma  Dell Technologies  T Mobile US  Vistra Energy And Crown Castle International,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 23  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Williams Sonoma  Inc    NYSE WSM    Dell Technologies Inc    NYSE DELL    T Mobile US  Inc    NASDAQ TMUS    Vistra Energy Corp    NYSE VST   and Crown Castle International Corp    NYSE CCI   5 Top Ranked Stocks with Strong Sales GrowthWith the commencement of third quarter earnings  investors are picking stocks based on earnings strength  However  while it is easy to manipulate the bottom line through cost cutting measures  sales growth comes in handy in gauging a company s future financial performance Top line is the vital parameter for understanding a company s health and ability to sustain its business  It provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  The main advantage is that sales figures are generally not manipulated and are less volatile than earnings Sales growth is a key measure for any company  as it is important for earnings projections and strategic decision making  Without top line growth  bottom line improvement may not be sustainable in the long term Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  Hence  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees

9884,231399,DELL,Finally  A Market Correction  But Earnings Aren t The Issue ,opinion,The S P 500 has corrected 4 5  since the key benchmark ticked 1 474 in mid September  with most of the cacophony from the mainstream media revolving around a poor 3rd quarter and 2012 earnings reports  The problem is  it has been expected for almost the last three months that 3rd quarter S P 500 earnings would see slightly negative in terms of year over over earnings growth  and even flat to slightly negative revenue growth As of Friday  October 26th  the  forward 4 quarter  estimate for the S P 500 was  111 14  down from last week s  111 83  but still near the record high forward estimate recorded on October 5th  2012 of  112 06  Year over year revenue growth for the 3rd quarter  2012 S P 500 aggregate revenues is  0 6   versus the October 5th estimate of  0 1  More importantly  the year over year growth number for forward earnings that we cited two weeks ago was 5 54   down slightly from last week s y y growth of 5 72  Unfortunately  S P 500 earnings data  courtesy of ThomsonReuters  is like Presidential polls or statistics in general  you can interpret or  spin  the numbers anyway you want  and make them fit your version of reality  versus simply letting the numbers tell the story  One shortcoming in the ThomsonReuters data that we see  is that while the data shows forward 4 quarters earnings growth by sector  ThomsonReuters does not do the same with forward revenue estimates  The only revenue number we get by sector for the S P 500 is the current quarter  Here is the ThomsonReuters earnings forecast for the S P 500 from Q4  12 through Q3  13  and then full year 2013  both as of Friday  October 26th  and as of October 1st  2012  What we are trying to show is   since Q3  12 earnings season has started   how analysts have changed their forward estimate expectations   given the current environment Q3  12   1 2  vs  2 1 Q4  12   8 2  vs  9 9 Q1  13   6 1  vs  7 1 Q2  13   9 8  vs  10 4 Q3  13   13 8  vs 15 9 2013   11 3 vs  11 6 While consensus analyst expectations have trimmed forward quarters slightly  it is our own opinion  and we are out here alone on this one   that the S P 500 year over year earnings growth will reach its nadir in Q3  12  and then slowly accelerate into Q4  12 and beyond  which is what the earnings forecasts tell us currently Part of our belief in Q3  12 being the bottom is that we have the Presidential election in 9 days  and the looming uncertainty over what the fiscal cliff means for spending and personal and corporate tax rates  There continues to be a tremendous amount of uncertainty over what the future will look like both from a political and economic perspective  and these are often one in the same   thus no one wants to be aggressive and   or bullish about expected stock prices  which in my opinion has created an unusual amount of pessimism around earnings and economic activity One final stat for readers  here are the year over year S P 500 earnings and revenue growth by SECTOR for the S P 500 for Q3  12 Cons discr   8  and  3 4 Cons stpls   1 6  and  1 7 Energy   16 and  17 7 Fincls   6 3  and  0 1 Hlth Care   0 3  and  5 8 Indus   5 4  and  1 5 Basic Mat   26 4  and  4 9 Tech   1 3  and  3 5 Telco   2 7  and  2 7 Utility  8 9  and  8 0 The only sector that has consistently shown upward revisions to sector earnings estimates since July 1 is Financials  not just for the 3rd quarter  but the 4th quarter  2012 estimates as well  The financial sector continues to reflect tepid revenue growth of flat to  1   which has been the case since the March  09 market low  even though Financial sector earnings estimates continue to be revised higher  Financials are doing more with less Trading   market update  The S P 500 is finally getting to an oversold level for the first time since late May  early June  2012  Per Bespoke  of the 10 S P 500 sectors  technology is the most oversold of all the sectors currently  Consumer staples is next    Our sector overweights continue to be Technology  Financial Services   Industrials  which has hurt our performance this year  Our performance relative to the S P 500 has improved throughout 2012  as we have lifted our large cap pharma exposure  but we haven t embraced the telco and utility  part of the so called dividend trade  sectors as we should  and as others have suggested simply because I dont feel there is the value in these sectors that I see in our top 3 sectors    We have had very good relative performance in our straight bond fixed income accounts  given our credit overweight  and our over weighting of high yield  but I have cautioned clients that proposed tax changes around the fiscal cliff could be more disruptive than what most clients think  We have a heightened awareness around corporate high yield as an asset class  given that it is being viewed as almost a safe haven trade today  somewhat pradoxically  as investors reach for yield  No question we are nervous about the amount of money the asset class has attracted  and attention   not to mention favorable commentary high yield has gotten in the financial media    As we tweeted about this week   trinityassetman   even though we have seen a 4 5  correction in the S P 500 since mid September  Treasuries haven t rallied much despite the weak stock market  This is another indication that the  character  of the market is changing  In 2010 and 2011  we saw a quite a bit of volatility  and numerous  1  days   but in 2012  particularly this rally since early June  July  the market has been relatively constrained and quiet  as it has slowly crept higher  Even though the S P 5oo is off 4 5  from its high  the month to date return on the Treasury ETF s are all negative  using Bespoke return data     Technology earnings reports have been ugly  IBM  IBM   our largest tech position outdside of Apple  AAPL   is down 10  since reporting  but even Sandisk  SNDK   which beat on both EPS and revenues  and guided higher  is down 5  since it reported  Technology will soon get to a point where sentiment and fundamentals lead to a bounce  Look at the weekly chart of Intel  INTC   below    the stock held and bounced off its 200 week moving average  and ended Friday close to its weekly high  despite ongoing issues with the S P 500  Since  04  it has paid to put INTC in the low  20 s and sell into the high  20 s  Intel is now heavily oversold on both the daily and weekly charts     To his credit  Vitaliy Katsenelson  the author of a couple of pretty good investment books  and a friend   colleague from our  days  warned me that Windows 8  MSFT  would not be what people thought  and the reviews have been decidedly mixed to negative  The  tile  or touch GUI  seems vastly different than the old  Icon and mouse  function  and although Windows 8 lets a user revert back to the traditional GUI format  the fact is   from an adoption standpoint   this new touch screen will require a longer learning curve  and take more getting used to than the previois Windows operating systems upgrades  This will slow the adoption on Windows 8  which is slow already given the increasing acceptance of tablets  and the declining relevance of the PC  Still  we listened to Rick Sherlund  the famed software analyst that was formerly with Goldman Sachs during PC and tech halcyon days of the late 1990 s and he gives Windows 8 a  thumbs up  review  although he suspects it will take some getting used to on the part of consumers and the enterprise    Given the above  the PC sector is experiencing a  nuclear winter  in our opinion  We like Intel here under  22  and Microsoft  MSFT  even more at  26  Haven t bought Dell  DELL  or Hewlett  HPQ  yet  as we want both to base more  We think the next PC upgrade cycle could be as much about job growth as technology  The PC will not be relegated to the graveyard completely   Long INTC and MSFT   may add more this week  depending on the action     Google  GOOG  is a maddening stock  as Barron s noted and we completely agree  The way it trades seems to be completely detached from any economic reality  We maintain a small position in the stock within client accounts  but it is   without a doubt   the most puzzling trading action we ve ever seen  GOOG traded from  570 to  770 between 2nd and 3rd quarter  2012 earnings  on very little substance  After this most recent earnings fiasco  the stock will now likely chop around from the low  600 s to the  700 s aimlessly    Amazon  AMZN  is the best secular growth story in retail  but seems ridiculously overvalued on any meaningful valuation metric  That being said  AMZN with  63 billion in expected annual revenues in 2012  represents just 1  of total global retail sales  Amazon s annual rev s are just 10    12  of Wal Mart  WMT   still  to give the reader some perspective on Amazon s growth potential   long AMZN and WMT    We still love WMT even though it is still consolidating its breakout over the all time high of  70 25   long AMZN  WMT and would look to add to both on weakness     Housing data continues to improve  but homebuilder stocks have stalled  which we like to see  It was October  2011 when the homebuilders really started to move higher and names like Toll Brothers  TOL  and Lennar Corp   LEN  have doubled in the last year  We prefer Home Depot  HD  at this point  if you have to buy something housing related  but even then  I think Wal Mart is partially a housing related stock  The homebuilders will start to lap higher results when we enter into 2013  and the market might be starting to reflect that  Masco  MAS  reports this week  It is my own opinion  but the homebuilder s earnings seems to be inflated thanks to lower than usual effective tax rates even though these quarterly reports are strong  I can t find any good 3rd party research on what  normalized earnings  should be for the homebuilders  or if this is even the right way to look at the sector   Long HD  TOL  LEN  WMT  To conclude our ramblings for the week  we have seen our first decent market correction  now 6 weeks longs  since early June   which lasted about 8 weeks   with technology as oversold as I have seen it since late 2011  Corporate earnings estimates  either current or forward  havent changed that much  so take the financial media cacophony with a grain of salt  I do think the Presidential election and the uncertainty over 2013 tax rates and spending  has created an unusual amount of angst on the part of both the longer term investor and the corporate manager  all of which will seem clearer when we wake up on Wednesday  November 7th ,2012-10-29,Brian

9886,231401,DELL,Danske Daily  Greek Agreement  Euro Strengthens  US Yields Move Higher,opinion,Key news Eurogroup Finance  Ministers have reached an agreement  on  the second bailout package for Greece Funding gap closed by larger write down for private investors  lower interest rates on Greece s loans and contribution from ECB s profits on its Greek bonds There has been a slightly positive impact on risk sentiment   EUR has strengthened and European stock markets are expected to open slightly higher Markets Overnight The Eurogroup Finance Ministers in the early morning hours reached an agreement on a second bailout package for Greece  The deal still includes only EUR130bn in new loans from the other euro area countries  The extra money needed in order for Greece to reach a debt to GDP ratio close to 120  in 2020 will mainly be provided by an additional write down on private investors  government bonds  raised from 50  to 53 5    a further reduction in the interest rates on the loans from the eurozone countries that were part of the first bailout package for Greece  interest rate will now be 150bp above euribor  and finally Greece is expected to benefit from an arrangement in which the ECB distributes its profits on its holdings of Greek government bonds to national central banks and governments   According to Finance Minister Sch uble Greece has also accepted that the disbursements of aid will be paid into an escrow account that will give priority to payments on Greece s debt before releasing money for its national budget  It is not yet clear to what degree the agreement will include tighter monitoring mechanisms The final details of the PSI debt swap agreement have not been released yet  However  according to the Head of the Eurogroup  Jean Claude Juncker  the new Greek bonds will be a coupon of 2  in 2014  3  from 2015 2020 and 4 3  after 2020  It has also been announced that Greece will introduce a collective action clause on existing bonds The announcement of the deal has been slightly positive for risk sentiment  The US stock market  was closed for Presidents Day yesterday  but US stock futures have moved slightly higher on the back of the announcement of the deal  There has only been a modest impact on  the  Asian stock markets   with Nikkei and Hang Seng both down 0 3   US bond yields have moved slightly higher in Asian trade with 10 year US bond yields up by 3bp to 2 04  since trading started  In the FX market EUR USD jumped from 1 319 to 1 327 after the announcement of the deal  but EUR has only strengthened slightly since the markets closed in Europe yesterday  JPY has also weakened across the board since market close in Europe yesterday and USD JPY is this morning trading 79 72  In the Scandinavian currencies SEK has strengthened slightly since the announcement of the deal Global Daily Focus today   The markets will be studying the details of the second bailout package for Greece  The agreement is very much as expected so we anticipate only a slightly positive reaction  This should pave the way for the publication of the PSI deal and whether Greece will implement a collective action clause on existing Greek government bonds  EU Finance Ministers are scheduled to meet at 09 00 CET in connection with the Ecofin meeting in Brussels  Otherwise we have a very light calendar today  with probably only euro area consumer confidence for February able to attract some attention in the market  Fixed income markets  A Greek deal has been announced overnight  Although this was widely expected  it should be slightly positive for risk appetite today and we expect some moderate pressure on the long end of the curve in the safe haven markets  Remember that the deal needs approval in local parliaments  so there is still some tail risk left  The Danish Debt Management office is tapping in the 5Y and 10Y benchmark today and the US Treasury is selling USD 35bn 2yr notes tonight  A few interesting earnings reports are due today including Home Depot Inc   Wal Mart Stores Inc  and Dell Inc  FX markets  Today s calendar is rather thin and hence the markets are likely to scrutinize the details from last night s bailout package for Greece  Even though the deal was not far from what had been expected  it reduces near term downside risks to EUR  as Greece will now be able to meet the  20 March debt redemptions  From that perspective we could expect further unwinding of the substantial EUR short positions currently in place  As we have argued previously  however  recent price developments in EUR USD are not all about Greece  and further improvement in macro data and market sentiment as we expect over the coming months will be needed to propel the pair significantly higher ,2012-02-21,Danske Markets,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/danske-daily:-greek-agreement,-euro-strengthens,-us-yields-move-higher-114549",114549

9891,231406,DELL,Have We Entered The Post PC World ,opinion,With everyone now claiming the death of the personal computer  it is hard to swim against a moving tide  According to a recent   PC shipments may have hit their peak and actually declined this year for the first time in history  Dell  DELL  and HP  HPQ  stock prices are at ten year lows  Tablets  phones  and all things smart have been growing at a torrid pace  All signs point to the inevitable end of an era  so why  then  am I so skeptical  Is the Atma Business Blog trying to  party like its 1999  Make no mistake  PC manufacturers are being squeezed and will continue to be so  On the one end there is mass move to smarter  smaller devices  On the other end  Asian manufacturers such as Acer and Lenovo are dropping prices and stealing share from incumbents  In the enterprise space  cloud based solutions and the growth of data centers is diminishing the need for computing capacity on a local level  We re not dealing with a growth story here   However  the buzz for the new devices is probably overdone right now since they are in the early stages  remember when PCs were supposed to replace servers    Even in today s  smart  world  PC s are still the most intelligent devices out there  PCs provide more computing power  storage  and access to software applications  Tablets have great functionality but do less  Whether it be enterprise level data mining or consumer internet shopping  the need for horsepower and the desire to do more will continue to grow  Also  as I alluded to in a post a few years ago  we will not be satisfied with keeping all of our valuables exclusively in the hands of third party cloud providers and will require some level of local storage   Tablets and other gadgets are nice to have but seem to be incremental to PCs  Mass use of the internet is still best done on a PC  While Twitter gives us instant information  it is no substitute for the New York Times  Good luck trying to utilize your CRM or ERP system in a meaningful way through a tablet  And to this day  software  apps  like Powerpoint are head and shoulders above iOs  apps   Perhaps households and corporations will need fewer PCs in the future  but I don t they can get by without them   What will change is how tomorrow s PCs will look and who will bring them to us  To this day  I still can t figure out how HP and Dell missed tablets and smartphones  How did Intel  INTC  give away low power processing chips to ARM  ARMH   Certainly  was at play  Perhaps manufacturers like Samsung  SSNLF  or Apple  AAPL  that seem to have successfully changed their products with the times will continue to gain share  There also seems to be an unmet need in which new players could emerge through innovation  Expect a convergence of the things we like from a PC with the UI and ease of smart devices  Today s gadgets appeal to our  wow  need rather than taking a comprehensive approach  The need for intelligence and personal computing will continue to rise and tomorrow s PC s will need to reflect that need  The next generation will be more robust and remain the center of our computing needs  Call me crazy  but I wouldn t be surprised to start seeing VC investment into the next generation of PCs  And perhaps those entrepreneurs will take their sales pitch on the road in their little red corvette ,2012-10-19,Atma Business Blog,https://www.investing.com/analysis/have-we-entered-the-post-pc-world-140388,140388
9892,231407,DELL,Which Assets Will Benefit From QE   ,opinion,Market NotesEquity market internals continue to deteriorate  especially in the Technology sector  which transitionally has had leading characteristics  Thursday night we saw that Google  GOOG  broke down due to disappointment in revenues and earnings  Other major components that have been struggling as of late include all the big names like Apple  APPL   Microsoft  MSFT   IBM  IBM   Intel  INTC   Amazon  AMZN   Advanced Micro  AMD   HP  HPQ   Dell  DELL  and many others  Percentage of stocks within the Nasdaq 100 index that are above 50 MA stand at 42   while those above 200 MA stand at 52     which is a major warning signal that the bull market end is very close  Furthermore  the  once again If it wasn t already bad enough that economic growth was at stall speed  margin and revenue conditions are starting to deteriorate  also volatility and sentiment are at very complacent levels  stock market investors have another headwind to deal with  Various sentiment surveys on safe haven currencies like the US dollar  not shown here  and Japanese yen  chart above  show high levels of pessimism  Historically  the S P 500 has struggled every time traders and investors turned negative on the Japanese yen  Will this time be different  Nymex heating Oil prices tend to hold a very close correlation relationship with North Sea Ice Brent Crude Oil prices  Therefore  it does make sense to track hedge fund positioning in the Heating Oil market to try and determine the confidence of investors  The chart above shows that hedge funds betting on energy  extended their bullish bets to the highest level since the February 2011  Libyan Crisis   just as Heating Oil and Brent Crude were topping  Even more importantly  small speculative COT positions  not shown here   which tend to be known as Dumb Money  have now risen to the highest bullish level in at least a decade  Only a few weeks ago    Price has lost over 10  since then If the   consider the following  It has come to my attention that a plan to construct the world s tallest building will take place in China next year  Furthermore London is planning to construct Western Europe s tallest building around the same time  Those not familiar with the curse of skyscrapers and business cycles  should give it a   Basically  research has shown that the  world s tallest buildings have risen on the eve of economic downturns  Business cycles and skyscraper construction correlate in such a way that investment in skyscrapers peaks when cyclical growth is exhausted and the economy is ready for recession  Featured Article There are two parts to this featured post  The first part is more linked to the mechanics of investing and how to try and reducing mistakes  a few emails I have received have been to do more with the way I invest instead of what I invest into   while the second part turns back to the topic of what we could expect in the Precious Metals market  Part I As I was reading all my favourite blogs and newsletters in late September and early October  it became obvious very quickly that every man and his dog turned into a Precious Metals bull  Charts were popping up left  right and centre of how Gold s almost vertical short term rise would continue into the skies  Here are some examples of predictions by consensus calls done between late September and early October  showing how Gold was going to go to  1 900 or even  2 000 per ounce           Before I continue  I d like to say  I am not picking out certain investors for the sake of them being right or wrong  This is capitalism so it is not about who made what call  but instead it is about the money   profit   gain  Personal money is always in question and some of the time even other people s money is also in question  therefore what I am always trying to teach my readers is basically to either be a contrarian or end up being a casualty  Regardless of whether something is in a bullish or bearish trend  following consensus and not doing any of your own thinking is usually a good way to go broke  very quickly  Remember  when you see a lot of people drawing vertical upside arrows for any asset  like in those six examples or hundreds of others seen throughout the internet during late September and early October  it is usually a signal that something completely opposite will happen Be it Merrill Lynch  UBS or Deutsche Bank overly confident technical newsletter calls  or be it consensus blogger calls  or be it contrarian   or be it retail hot money flowing into the sector again  chart above   or be it high bullish exposure by hedge funds via COT  or be it the   it became very clear to me that instead of Gold going up to  1 900 or  2 000 as  the mob speculators  predicted in late September  it would probably go to  1 700 or even lower first  Personally  two major purchases I made within the Precious Metals sector were in late December 2011 and also early July 2012  While others turned very optimistic as prices rose into late September  I noticed that the short term froth became apparent and therefore  I turned very cautious  Even though my fund cash inflows as a   of NAV has been increasing from various partners  with the pressure to gain more exposure to PMs due to QE3  I refused to chase the price   I delayed purchases even though I am very bullish on long term Precious Metal prospects and as already explained above   I m always trying to discipline myself to either be a contrarian or I will end up being a casualty  I plan to do more of these real time examples through the course of the PMs bull market  Hopefully it helps some of you who are trying to practice disciplined investing as I ve learned  and still continue to learn  the hard way Part II  An interesting number of events happened during 2007  which hold quite a few similarities to current market conditions  During the early parts of 2007  economic activity started to deteriorate and the subprime crisis started to spread throughout the financial system  This was followed by a decline in revenues  earnings and profits margins  which forced stock market prices to top out around the middle parts of 2007   To try and re start economic activity and reflate risk assets  Ben Bernanke stimulated the economy through a monetary policy of cutting interest rates  But this didn t really help the stock  earnings and the economy and instead just inflated the price of commodities  including Precious Metals like Silver  seen in the chart above    The fundamental events of late 2007 closely link to the current deteriorating economic activity  falling revenues   earnings   profit margins and topping out of stock price  many leading indices like the Nasdaq are very weak   In the background  the Eurozone Debt Crisis  with contagion similarities to the Subprime  has been spreading throughout the financial system   During the early parts of the Eurozone Debt Crisis in 2010  the centre of attention was Greece  but we have quickly moved towards Spain and Italy  Eventually  I think the whole Eurozone will be in a crisis and even Germany will be affected  Even after 20 plus EU emergency summits  we are without a proper long term solution  but that is a story for another day   This is very similar to the way we started off with the US subprime  which eventually spread globally in a full blown financial crisis   To stop these events from cascading into a full blown crisis  is the same man who tried to stop the Subprime events from cascading   Ben  Helicopter  Bernanke  Together with the rest of the   Helicopter Ben announced unlimited QE program which is once again partly the cause of rising commodity prices including Precious Metals  At the same time  money printing will most likely not help the economic activity including revenue  earnings and profit margins which stock prices correlate very highly with So are we repeating 2007  where the Equities top out and Precious Metals take off  I am not 100  sure  but the chart above shows that so far everything is moving according to the plan  The close relationship in price between August 2007 with Bernanke cutting rates is very similar to the recent bottom in July 2012 as Bernanke launched QE3  If the analogue as well as the seasonal pattern holds  we should see some more selling in Silver for the rest of October  bad seasonal month   before we resume an uptrend   On the other hand  if the analogue pattern does not hold  Precious Metals could join the selling pressure with other risk assets like equities  currencies and industrial commodities  The important point to remember is that Precious Metals remain in a long term bull market and the key for wise investors is to always buy low  when the majority are sellers  In other words  do not panic if prices decline  but instead just accumulate more  Helicopter Ben will just increase the monthly QE dosage for all the heroin addicts and Pavlov s dogs out there  As cash levels swell up in my fund  in the coming weeks or months  I will consider adding exposure to the PMs sector again  After all  in a bull market  we are meant to be buying  sounds simple  but many forget this basic rule   However  I won t just buy at any point or any price  I would like to see some or maybe even all of the following criteria  before I add further funds to this asset class sentiment surveys falling below neutrality  currently too high hedge fund reducing futures positioning  currently on high side market open interest speculation declining  rose too rapidly retail crowd hot money leaving ETFs  currently too high increase in ETFs short interest ratio activity  currently too low large Put purchase levels relative to Calls  currently too low Finally  a major buy signal would be to see some of the consensus bloggers and technical analysts  who were predicting  1900 Gold as recently as a few weeks ago  to start doubting Gold s uptrend because their Elliot Wave counts  cycle frameworks and various technical indicators break down rapidly  As I have been saying all along  it is my view that certain risk assets like Precious Metals and Agriculture will benefit much more from Fed s QE  while other risk assets like stocks might not benefit at all  So therefore stay patient  stay alert and stay a contrarian  Remember that when it s obvious to the public  it is obviously wrong Trading Diary  Last update 19th of October 12 Outlook  The  towards a recession  The United States GDP has grown     while  with an

During its forecast for fiscal 2020  the manufacturer of IT products and services provider  had warned that sales growth will slow over the next year  hurt by the global economic issues that may weaken corporate demand for the company s hardware products 

During the past year  Dell consistently generated strong hardware sales  as the company prepared to transition back to the public markets after five years of restructuring aimed at cutting back debt and simplifying a tangled corporate structure  Investors liked the restructured Dell  sending its shares higher by 50  until late May of 2019 
But the stock has fallen about 24  since then  after the company predicted there would be weaker spending on technology  Dell executives said during a call in August that they expected IT spending to be  soft  throughout the rest of the fiscal year  particularly in China 
The company also narrowed its annual revenue projection to  92 7 billion to  94 2 billion  from the February forecast of  93 billion to  96 billion

There is no major economic data on today s calendar  with only a report on factory orders due at 10 00AM ET  1400GMT  
The earnings calendar will be fairly quiet with no major companies set to report results  though investors will get quarterly updates from Dell Technologies  NYSE DVMT   Palo Alto Networks  NYSE PANW  and Coupa Software  NASDAQ COUP  
2  China Warns The U S  On Tariffs 
China warned the United States on Sunday that any agreements reached on trade and business between the two countries will be void if Washington implements tariffs and other trade measures  as the two ended their latest round of talks in Beijing 
The world s two largest economies have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars  worth of tariffs in recent months  leading to worries that Washington and Beijing may engage in a full scale trade war that could damage global growth and roil markets 
With a lack of major economic reports and earnings news  markets could focus more heavily on trade related headlines in the coming week as President Donald Trump prepares to meet world leaders at the G7 summit in Canada 
3  Dollar Pushes Lower As U S China Trade Tensions Weigh
The dollar started the week lower  after weekend talks between the U S  and China on trade ended without a breakthrough  raising the danger that negotiations could collapse 
The dollar index was off almost 0 4  to 93 76 
There are no Federal Reserve speakers in the coming week since it is the quiet period ahead of the June 12 13 Federal Open Market Committee meeting  when the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates 
The U S  central bank is increasingly likely to raise rates a fourth time this year after last week s employment report showed U S  job growth accelerated in May and the unemployment rate dropped to an 18 year low of 3 8  
The U S  Labor Department s report also showed solid wage gains  pointing to rapidly tightening labor market conditions  which could stir concerns about inflation 
4  Oil Prices Stay Under Pressure
Oil prices got the week off to a lackluster start  as rising U S  crude production and expectations that OPEC members will raise supplies remained in focus 
U S  West Texas Intermediate WTI crude was down 12 cents  or 0 2   at  65 69 a barrel  sitting around its lowest since April 11 
Brent crude futures were down 35 cents  or around 0 5   at  76 43 a barrel 
Prices have struggled in recent sessions on concerns that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non OPEC members led by Russia would pump more crude  even as U S  oil output rises 
Meanwhile  Brent s premium over WTI futures remained near three year highs above  10 a barrel  The premium has doubled in less than a month  as a lack of pipeline capacity in the United States has trapped a lot of output inland 
5  European Markets  Euro Boosted By Easing Political Risks
European financial markets extended their recovery rally  boosted by signs of easing political risks in Italy and Spain 
The pan European Stoxx 600 was up around 0 5  during mid morning trade  with all sectors and major bourses in positive territory 
Among national indexes  Italian and Spanish equities were the top gainers  having suffered a week of heightened uncertainty as Italian parties negotiated a government and Spain s Prime Minister was ousted 
Meanwhile  the euro tacked on 0 6  against the dollar to 1 1731  EUR USD   well clear of last week s 10 month low of 1 1506 
In a further sign of the calmness that has returned to the market  the spread on Italian and Spanish bond yields over benchmark German Bunds narrowed sharply ",2018-06-04,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-monday-1478411,1478411
135157,356672,DELL,Amit Yoran leaves Dell RSA unit to head Tenable Network Security,news,"By Jim Finkle
 Reuters    Amit Yoran is stepping down as president of Dell Technologies Inc s  N DVMT  cyber security unit to run Tenable Network Security Inc  a well financed private cyber security company that is looking to boost revenue growth 
Yoran  46  will succeed Ron Gula  who co founded Tenable 14 years ago  resigned the CEO post in June and is stepping down as chairman  Tenable said on Thursday  Yoran will start Jan 3 
Columbia  Maryland based Tenable competes with  Qualys Inc   O QLYS  and  Rapid7 Inc   O RPD  in selling software that businesses and governments use to monitor large computer networks for security vulnerabilities and anomalies that indicate cyber attacks 
Dell executive David Goulden  who oversees the RSA cyber security unit  said in an email to employees that the company had identified  a highly qualified successor  to Yoran who would step into the role in early January  according to a person familiar with the situation 
Fourteen year old Tenable  whose clients include U S  intelligence agencies  raised  230 million in a November 2015 venture capital funding round that set a record for the cyber security industry 
Yoran joined RSA via the acquisition of network forensics firm NetWitness  a firm he founded and led as CEO  He also served as founding director of the Department of Homeland Security s United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team  or US CERT  a government agency that helps protect Americans against cyber attacks 
 We are bringing on a professional CEO to bring the company to its next phase of growth   Tenable co founder and President Jack Huffard said in an interview 
Yoran told Reuters he will focus on growing the company  expanding its product portfolio through internal development and possible acquisitions 
Tenable has previously said it has been profitable since its early days  That long distinguished the firm from most cyber security and technology startups  which spend heavily on product development and marketing so they can grow as quickly as possible 
Huffard said the firm recently decided to boost spending  and has begun to operate at a loss so that it can  invest  in future growth 
 It s a measured approach to growth  not a crazy approach   he said   Getting back to profitability would not be difficult for us  
RSA was purchased by storage giant EMC Corp  NYSE EMC  in 2006  which used the acquisition to enter the cyber security business  It became part of Dell in September when the company bought EMC for  60 billion ",2016-12-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/amit-yoran-leaves-dell-rsa-unit-to-head-tenable-network-security-447993,447993

135286,356801,DELL,DEALTALK IT services in sweet spot as M A gathers steam,news,"  Improving spending  economy increase appeal of IT services
   Hardware  software firms looking for stability eye
services
 By S  John Tilak
 BANGALORE  Oct 28  Reuters    The U S  information
technology services sector is likely to be a focus of merger
and acquisition activity as its companies are among the most
attractive in the technology space 
 A rebound in tech spending has increased the appeal of IT
services companies and put them in the crosshairs as deal
momentum picks up in the industry 
 The ongoing recovery in the economy and credit markets has
made tech companies look for ways to come out on top  and they
have shown a willingness to pay hefty premiums in a sector that
has historically commanded high prices 
 IT services firms have a recurring revenue stream  high
margins  a strong growth outlook and impressive returns on
investment  making tempting targets for buyers  They offer
consulting  software services  business process outsourcing 
systems integration and interactive marketing 
 Cash rich technology giants plan to strengthen their
portfolios  and smaller firms want to stay in the game through
acquisitions as their larger rivals become even more
formidable 
 Attractive acquisition candidates include Sapient  Computer
Sciences  WNS  Amdocs  Cognizant Technology and ExlService 
analysts said 
 Consolidation is under way  In September  Xerox Corp said
it would buy Affiliated Computer Services Inc in a deal valued
at about  5 5 billion  and Dell Inc said it planned to buy
Perot Systems Corp for about  3 9 billion 
  The pattern here is that you have commoditizing tech
product companies looking for a strategy that s better than
doing nothing   Sanford C  Bernstein analyst Rod Bourgeois
said 
  They re looking at the IT services industry to juice up
their struggling tech product business  
 Possible acquirers could be tech giants such as IBM 
Hewlett Packard or Cisco  European players like BT or Deutsche
Telekom and Asian companies like Hitachi  Fujitsu or NEC 
analysts said 
  There s definitely going to be some strategic acquisitions
   there s no doubt about that   Goldman Sachs analyst Julio
Quinteros said   It s just  how much are you willing to pay 
And would you rather wait for the market to come back a little
bit  
 The recurring revenue stream that IT services firms have gives
them more visibility and stability 
  What s driving a lot of this is the evolution of hardware
companies looking for more stability and recurring revenues
that are typically associated with services models and by the
same token software companies potentially looking for the same
thing   Quinteros said 
 Hardware and software companies want to diversify their
portfolios by adding services  to help them survive and even
prosper through tough times 
  What s alluring about services for tech product companies
is first the precedent of IBM and HP coupling products with
services to be able weather the downturn well   Bourgeois said 
 In 2008  Hewlett Packard acquired EDS for  13 billion in
what is considered the biggest acquisition in the space ever 
In 2002  IBM bought PwC Consulting from PricewaterhouseCoopers
for about  3 5 billion 
  Vendors are trying  to some extent  to emulate the
integrated model that IBM really pioneered when they got into
the services business years ago   UBS analyst Jason Kupferberg
said   HP followed suit buying EDS  Now you re seeing a
continuation of that theme  
 TRANSFORMATIONAL IN NATURE
 A barrier for acquisitions is valuations  analysts said 
 For example  Cognizant  with a market capitalization of
about  11 75 billion  is trading at 24 times forward earnings 
  I don t necessarily believe that valuations will
completely prevent these deals from happening now   Kupferberg
said   A lot of these companies have a lot of cash on the
balance sheets  So they can afford to do some deals  
 While analysts are sure that deals will happen  not
everyone is certain they will be blockbusters 
 Large mergers in the space are not necessarily wise moves 
said Abhi Gami  a senior equity analyst with Invesco Aim  an
investor in IT services stocks such as Accenture  Cognizant 
IBM and HP 
  They are almost by definition transformational  where the
acquiring company will need to make significant changes to its
operations in that space in order to integrate the newly
acquired large services business   Gami said 
  I think a transformational deal by its nature creates a
lot of risk  
 IT services companies could be acquirers themselves  with
companies like Accenture capable of pulling off big deals 
 A range of companies  such as Hewitt Associates in human
resources  Jack Henry   Associates in transaction processing 
Amdocs in telecoms billing or Genpact in back office offshore
services  could prove to be attractive targets for Accenture 
Kupferberg said 
 Hot areas in services include interactive marketing and
risk management  Brigantine Advisors analyst Matthew McCormack
said 
  Sapient would be a very good example of a smaller IT
services company that has focused on some very specific areas
that have very good longer term growth outlook   McCormack
said 
 Sapient  which offers interactive marketing and risk
management services  trades at 32 times forward earnings 
 One group of services firms that are likely to be involved
in M A are the Indian outsourcers  which include Tata
Consultancy  Infosys Technologies and Wipro 
 While most analysts say they are more likely acquirers 
Goldman s Quinteros sees it both ways 
  I can also make the case that they could be takeout
candidates because they have not done an effective job in
really moving up the food chain  bringing the value add
competency to the skill set table   he said ",2009-10-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/equities-news/dealtalk-it-services-in-sweet-spot-as-m-a-gathers-steam-98411,98411

   S CRM is a  1 bln market  with 30 40 pct growth
   Targets are companies that monitor social media

 By Siddharth Cavale	
 BANGALORE  April 25  Reuters    In May 2008  a blog post
caught computer maker Dell Inc by surprise  popular
tech blog Gizmodo had broken news about Dell s Inspiron 910
mini notebook    months ahead of its launch    after seeing CEO
Michael Dell toting the notebook at an industry conference  	
 Instead of staying mum  Dell saw an opportunity in the
frenzied online buzz to track what was being said about the
notebook and gauge the level of potential users  expectations  	
 And it paid off  	
 Dell realized potential customers were planning to pass up a
competitor s projects for the new Dell Mini 9  the social media
chatter was extending the buying cycle and driving demand    	
 A combination of social media and traditional customer
relations management    social CRM    is allowing companies like
Dell to track customer conversations  react swiftly to issues
they raise  gain insight into their needs and interact with
them 	
  The  social CRM  market is over  1 billion in social
business solutions this year and is growing at 30 40 percent  
said Michael Fauscette  analyst at research house IDC 	
 Companies that provide customer relationship management
services on the Internet  or  cloud  services  are alive to the
opportunity and are snapping up firms that offer social media
monitoring services 	
 This marriage of social media  such as Facebook  Twitter 
and blogs  with the  cloud     a term that refers to the shift
to providing software  computing power and data storage on the
Internet    has been dubbed Cloud 2 0  	
 Last month  Salesforce com bought Canada based
Radian6  which counts Dell   Kodak and 
PepsiCo among its customers  for  326 million 
 ID nSGE72T037  Smaller rival RightNow Technologies 
bought HiveLive in late 2009  and SuccessFactors last
year bought out CubeTree 	
 
 
 
 CRM vendors  spending on social software to support sales 
marketing and customer service processes will top  1 billion
worldwide within two years  IT research firm Gartner estimates 	
 That figure compares to a forecast of more than  12 billion
for overall spending on CRM software in 2012  meaning social CRM
will account for around 8 percent of total CRM spending next
year  double this year s level  Gartner said 	
 Given how so called cloud stocks have performed 
investors appear receptive to companies making these
acquisitions to accelerate growth in new areas like social
media  Shares of Salesforce rose 6 percent after its Radian6
news  and Successfactors gained 8 percent after buying CubeTree 	
 Industry analysts say cloud computing projects tend to
generate quick returns  allowing companies to quickly recoup
what they spend on the projects and see tangible benefits to
their businesses   ID nN06150123  	
 
 INTEREST IS THERE     	
  I bet a lot of Salesforce s peers are looking at this as
well     it looks like a lot of them are slow or are confused
about social CRM  which they say is still in its infancy   said
Lyle Fong  CEO of Lithium Technologies  which provides similar
social media monitoring solutions to Radian6  and is cited by
analysts as a potential acquisition target 	
 Lithium  which used to provide Internet traffic monitoring 
bought Scout Labs last year and transformed itself into a social
media monitoring service 	
 IDC s Fauscette sees Oracle and Salesforce    which
was founded by CEO Marc Benioff in 1999  when he left Oracle   
as potential buyers for Lithium Technologies 	
  I m not sure Salesforce s acquisition of Radian6 indicates
a broader trend of consolidation in the industry   said Subha
Rama  senior analyst with ABI Research   However  it does
demonstrate that companies are looking to understand the return
on investment from their social media initiatives  	
 As this capability is better delivered from the cloud  you
might see software as a service  SaaS  providers buying smaller
analytics firms to fill a skills gap  Rama said      	
  I don t think IBM will do a buy     they already
have an in house solution  but Oracle is definitely going to
look to acquire some products in this space   she said  	
 Lithium Tech s Fong reckons all the social media
monitoring companies will be bought out in the next year 	
  All the big ones are already gone     that space will
disappear as a stand alone space very shortly   he said

 NEW YORK  May 18  Reuters    An unexpected drop in U S 
oil supplies boosted crude prices as commodities rallied from
steep losses on Wednesday  helping lift global stocks after
five days of losses 
 On Wall Street  stocks were led by gains in energy and
basic materials shares  while a jump of almost 6 percent in
the stock of computer maker Dell boosted the technology
sector 
 Oil prices rose after a weekly government report showed a

 U S  crude is still down around 12 percent this month 
  There is a sense that perhaps the selling in the energy
markets was overdone   said Phil Flynn  an analyst at PFGBest

 Copper jumped 3 4 percent to a two week high  but doubts
about short term fundamentals were expected to cap prices  The
Reuters Jefferies CRB commodities index  rose 2 3
percent  its largest daily gain in two months 
 A stronger dollar and renewed concerns about global

 STOCKS RISE  EURO WOBBLES

index down on Tuesday to its lowest close since April 18 
 Europe s FTSEurofirst 300  rose 0 4 percent to
close at 1 130 89 
 The euro hovered near break even against the dollar in
volatile trade  Firmer stocks and commodities gave a floor to
the single currency  but the near term outlook remained
overcast as Greece s debt situation was still largely
unresolved 
 Most Federal Reserve officials prefer to raise benchmark
interest rates before selling assets when the time comes to
tighten policy  minutes of their April meeting showed

monetary stimulus should not be seen as an indication it will

 The euro edged 0 1 percent lower to  1 4222   On
Monday  it slumped to a seven week low of  1 4048

   Uniform rise in commodities helps Asia materials sector
   Financial markets still struggle for common theme

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE  May 19  Reuters    The dollar broke lower on
Thursday  with funds sensing the rally this month has ended and
expectations rising that commodity prices have resumed an
uptrend  pushing up equities in Asia s materials sector 	
 Investors have been struggling to find a common theme in
financial markets after two routs in commodities over the past
two weeks led to a reduction of risky assets in portfolios 
Economic data out of the United States and China also sent mixed
signals 	
 Some investors latched on to a rise in U S  10 year yields
from a low for the year hit overnight because the Federal
Reserve s  600 billion bond purchase programme starts winding
down next month and Fed officials expressed worries about
inflation  A rebound in the S P 500 index from a one month low
also played a role 	
 A slide in Treasury futures suggested more weakness was in
store for U S  bonds 	
 Higher U S  yields supported the dollar briefly against the
low yielding yen  but not against other major currencies  Price
action suggests investors are sensitive to relative interest
rate advantages  but also see the U S  currency bogged down with
economic and fiscal imbalances 	
 The euro was up 0 3 percent to  1 4294   trying to
chalk up a fourth consecutive day of gains after the market was
unable to push the common currency below its 200 week moving
average at  1 4000 	
  If you look at the next few months  the euro could fall to
around  1 35  But I guess it s difficult to sell the euro beyond
 1 40 now  when there s talk that the European Central Bank
could raise rates in July   said Minori Uchida  a senior analyst
at the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo 	
 The dollar was at 81 56 yen  down 0 1 percent after earlier
hitting a three week high of 81 82 yen  	
 Japan s Nikkei share average slipped 0 1 percent  
with tech shares reversing earlier gains and weighing on the
broader market 	
 Japan s economy shrank much more than expected in the first
quarter and slipped into recession after the triple blow of the
March earthquake  tsunami and nuclear crisis hit business and
consumer spending and disrupted supply chains   ID nL4E7GJ01B 	
 The difficult business environment has not hit stocks as
hard and many economists expect growth to resume in the second
half of the year  but power shortages are a real threat to the
world s third largest economy 	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1
percent  rallying from a six week low hit on Tuesday 	
 The materials sector was outperforming after commodities
prices posted their biggest gain in two months overnight  The
MSCI s Asia Pacific ex Japan materials sector index
 reflected the second highest returns for the
year to date among all sectors  but lagged far behind the top
consumer discretionary sector 	
 Australia  one of the most sensitive economies in the region
to commodity prices  saw its benchmark index rise 1 4 percent
   leading other Asian stock markets 	
 Miners listed in Australia were sold down too much when 	
commodities prices plunged two weeks ago and large cap 	
miners such as BHP and Rio Tinto in particular
are cheap  dealers and analysts said 	
  In the longer term  with our commodity price forecasts 
they remain attractive   said Mark Taylor  senior resources
analyst at Morningstar 	
 U S  crude s front month future edged up 0 3 percent to
 100 39 a barrel  and Brent was up 0 33 percent to  112 67
 	
 The June 10 year Treasury future slipped 1 32 to 122 14 32
 after the cash yield bounced 7 basis points to 3 18
percent on Wednesday 	
 Futures have broken an upward trend in place since early
April and have also dropped back below the 200 day moving
average  bearish technical signals that even without Washington
hitting its debt ceiling should give caution to bond bulls 	
 Central banks and domestic U S  mutual funds were buyers of
Treasuries overnight  though other longer term investors were
sellers of mid maturity paper  Royal Bank of Scotland said in a
note

 NEW YORK  Sept 21  Reuters    U S  stocks headed for a
lower open on Monday as a resurgent U S  dollar took a toll on
global commodity prices  with futures suggesting Wall Street
would open down nearly 1 percent

corporate profits justified a market run up to fresh 11 month

however  as investors seek more clarity about the 2010 profit
outlook and await hints of how strong results will be for the

it s the end of the rally just because we are starting to pull
back a little bit   said Marc Pado  U S  market strategist 
Cantor Fitzgerald   Co in San Francisco 
  We ve risen to a level that people are little bit more

 NEW YORK  Sept 21  Reuters    The Dow and S P 500 fell on
Monday as a stronger U S  dollar hurt energy and materials
stocks  but the Nasdaq gained on strength in biotech share 
 The dollar  which has been weak of late  rebounded Monday 
with the U S  Dollar index up 0 4 percent  putting  pressure on
crude oil and other commodities prices   
 The top drag on the Dow was Exxon Mobil   which fell 1 4

 The S P Materials  sector was the biggest drag  down 1 7

 NEW YORK  Sept 21  Reuters    U S  stock index futures fell
on Monday as a resurgent U S  dollar sparked a pullback in

 The benchmark S P 500  is up 58 percent since hitting
a 12 year closing low in early March  partly because of strong
second quarter earnings and optimism that an economic recovery
is gaining traction

135365,356880,DELL,COLUMN Don t bank too soon on Dell PC refresh  Eric Auchard,news,"   Eric Auchard is a Reuters columnist  The opinions expressed
are his own   
 
 By Eric Auchard
 LONDON  Aug 28  Reuters    Dell Inc s  quarterly earnings
report beat investor expectations that have been repeatedly
hammered down  But the computer maker s celebrations could be
short lived 
 Results for the second quarter ending in July were buoyed by
transient business factors as it continued to lose share in its
core PC business  Meanwhile  technology budgets are still being
slashed and the company s business  which depends heavily on
personal computers  is unlikely to be an early beneficiary of
any corporate spending rebound that could begin in 2010 
 Government computer spending saved the quarter for Dell as
public spending surpassed sales to its mainstay large commercial
customers for the first time  However  this was largely due to
seasonal education demand from state and local governments 
Sales to corporate customers and small and medium sized
businesses remained weak  falling 32 percent and 29 percent
respectively 
 It is a measure of Dell s battered condition that a fall in
government sales of just 16 percent and consumer sales of 9
percent were seen as positive factors  The Texas company was
alone among the top five PC makers to lose market share in the
second quarter compared to the same period a year earlier 
market research firm Gartner Inc says 
 For the current third quarter  government spending will have
to offset expected weaker corporate spending  especially in the
United States and Europe 
 Hopes for Dell s stock rest on the potential for the next
generation of Microsoft operating system software    Windows 7 
due out in October    to spur on a wave of computer upgrades
next year  The average corporate PC is now 4 5 years old  As PCs
represent a far larger chunk of Dell s sales than for other
computer manufacturers  it stands to be the biggest beneficiary
of any spurt in new sales 
 But there are doubts whether Windows software has the same
pulling power that it did a decade ago in terms of sparking
hardware upgrade cycles as corporate buyers control spending
more tightly these days 
 Another problem is that corporations and governments will
need to put additional computer servers  storage and software in
place before any major PC upgrade cycle gets underway 
 CEO Michael Dell is convinced that  a big refresh cycle  is
underway over the course of the next year  The question is when 
It could be 2011 before any broad PC upgrade begins to flow
through into company results 
 Despite all these questions  Dell s shares are up more than
10 percent after the report  The stock trades at a 15 5 multiple
to Wall Street s 2010 earnings forecasts  in line with the
computer hardware sector  but roughly 40 percent higher than
multiples of healthier  more diversified rivals Hewlett Packard
 and IBM  A big comeback in the company s fortunes looks priced
into the stock 
 Yet Dell still needs a major transformation of its business
model to attract more software and services revenue  See July 22
column  A brutal logic to Dell s reinvention  at 
 It must show progress in winning back consumers  while
cutting its overall PC exposure before anyone can call Dell a
turnaround

   Spent  23 billion on China products last year
   Saw demand stabilising in mid January
  Adds quotes  background 
 BEIJING  March 26  Reuters    Dell Inc s China sales grew
28 percent in unit terms in the year to January  accounting for
about 5 percent of the company s global business  Chief
Executive Michael Dell said on Thursday 
 The world s second largest personal computer maker also
purchased about  23 billion of products last year from China 
Dell s largest overseas market 
  Last year we spent  23 billion in China  and that made us
one of the largest purchasers of electronic equipment and goods
in China and one of the largest exporters   Dell told reporters
at an event to introduce the firm s newest products 
 Dell is introducing new server and storage products aimed
at cost conscious companies  betting that it can win market
share as competition intensifies 
 Dell itself has been in cost cutting mode for some time 
shedding jobs and overhauling its corporate structure as well
as increasing lower cost purchases from China 
 The company posted a sharp fall in fourth quarter revenue
as consumers bought cheaper personal computers and overall
demand remained weak  but cost cuts helped profits beat
expectations 
 Dell said customers were still hesitant to buy  but the
company had seen  steady  orders since the middle of January 
  Generally speaking around the middle of January we saw the
beginning of stabilisation in the demand trend  Demand has been
steady since then   he said 
 While unit shipments increased 28 percent in China    and
34 percent in Brazil  Russia  India and China together    the
company still gets about half of its revenue from the United
States  a higher proportion than larger rival Hewlett Packard
Co 
 Dell said last year it aimed to increase the ratio of sales
from outside the United States to two thirds within five years 
 Dell competes with network equipment maker Cisco Systems 
which is moving into the server market while HP has started to
offer a package of services to corporate clients after its
purchase of EDS 
 HP also posted disappointing quarterly revenues and cut its
full year outlook 
 Michael Dell believes talk of IBM possibly buying Sun
Microsystems could help accelerate a migration to servers based
on standard components  Dell s mainstay product 
 However  Dell said he would be cautious about spending the
 9 5 billion his company has in cash and cash equivalents 
  We will be pretty careful on finding the right things that
fit with our business   he said 
 Dell is still focused on data centres  services  software 
servers and storage products 
  Those are likely areas where Dell is likely to use its
capital for non organic growth   he said

   Jobs does not appear despite speculation
  Adds analysts  and developer comments  details 
 By Alexei Oreskovic and David Lawsky
 SAN FRANCISCO  June 8  Reuters    Apple Inc halved the
price of its entry level iPhone to  99 on Monday to widen the
trendy device s mass market appeal  as global competition heats
up after Palm Inc launched the Pre 
 Apple also cut prices on several of its Mac notebooks amid
a tooth and nail battle among computer makers for buyers during
the recession 
 And to shore up its hold on the smartphone market  it
unveiled a new  faster  high end iPhone that takes videos and
has voice features  matching offerings by rivals Palm and
Research in Motion s BlackBerry 
 Analysts said sales could double for the cheapest iPhone 
 Chief Executive Steve Jobs  on medical leave since January 
did not put in a much speculated about appearance 
 The next generation iPhone 3GS    the  S  stands for speed 
double that of the original model    goes on sale in the United
States  Germany and elsewhere on June 19 for  199 to  299 
  They plugged the hole in the offering of the 3G iPhone  
Gartner analyst Van Baker said  referring to the new features 
 A rambunctious crowd livened up Apple s annual Worldwide
Developers  Conference in downtown San Francisco on Monday 
whooping and applauding as executives unveiled everything from
a cheaper Mac Air notebook to a new operating system 
 Shares in Apple closed 0 6 percent down at  143 85    after
a 6 5 percent climb in the week leading up to the highly
anticipated event    as Jobs failed to show and investors
debated the merits of the sharp iPhone price cut 
 Morgan Stanley estimates that an entry level iPhone  at
what Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller calls a  breakthrough
price of  99   could double existing sales  That is for the
8 gigabyte model  previously priced at  199 
 Apple said it has sold more than 40 million of its iPhones
and music playing iPod Touches to date  up from the 37 million
reported during a quarterly earnings call in April 
 The new iPhone models and price cuts announced on Monday
came days after Palm launched its Pre smartphone  which some
analysts say is the iPhone s closest rival 
 Sprint Nextel Corp  which has exclusive U S  rights to
carry the Pre  said it had record sales of the smartphone in
its first weekend  and was restocking the phones  as quickly as
Palm could make them  
 A JAZZED UP PHONE
 The  99 iPhone will cost half as much as the  199 Pre  By
slashing the price of the 8 gigabyte iPhone and rolling models
out this month  Apple s strategy appeared designed to take
advantage of the Pre s limited availability  said CL King  
Associates  Lawrence Harris 
 In a note to investors on Monday  he estimated that Palm
produced just 50 000 Pre phones in May 
 AT T  the exclusive U S  service provider for the iPhone 
will sell the 16 gigabyte 3G for  149  down from  299  while
supplies last 
 Competition is intensifying among cellphone makers from
Nokia to HTC Corp for a slice of one of the few remaining
fast growth tech markets 
 Globally  research house Ovum expects 171 9 million
smartphones to ship this year  up 23 percent on 2008 and about
15 percent of the worldwide mobile phone market in 2009 
 But the battle in that lucrative arena is eroding margins 
 Apple executives did not comment on impact to profitability
from the cheaper iPhone or Mac Air    which at  1 499 is still
costlier than computers from the likes of Dell Inc or
Hewlett Packard Co 
 Shaw Wu  an analyst at Kaufman Brothers  said the price
cuts could dampen gross margin but noted that Apple had
forecast its margin would slip in the current quarter 
 Lower costs for components and the extra sales Apple hopes
to net should help alleviate the squeeze  he added 
 WHAT  ME WORRY 
 AT T said the halving in price would not affect its profit
targets  and that it was sticking to its objective for wireless
margins in the low 40 percent range 
 Apple s stock is historically volatile during the company s
June developer conference  It dropped about 7 percent over the
course of the conference in 2008 and about 4 percent in 2007

iPhones will support TomTom satellite navigation devices and
support multiplayer games such as Asphalt 5

 Some of the hundreds of developers  analysts  reporters and
industry insiders that gathered in downtown San Francisco had
hoped to catch a glimpse of founder and Chief Executive Jobs 
 Suspense and speculation had mounted in the months before
Apple s annual Worldwide Developers  Conference  with hopes
ranging from a cameo by Jobs    out till the end of June on
medical leave    to revelations of a game changing tablet
