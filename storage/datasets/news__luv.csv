199452,420968,LUV,Southwest failed to prioritize safety  FAA oversight too weak   report,news,"Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  closed  1 8  in today s trade following a WSJ report that the company has failed to prioritize safety and the Federal Aviation Administration has been ineffective in its oversight of the matter 
A U S  Department of Transportation report to be released in the coming days says Southwest pilots flew more than 17M passengers on planes with unconfirmed maintenance records over two years  and in 2019 smashed both wingtips of a jet on a runway while repeatedly trying to land amid gale force winds  according to WSJ 
The lapses reportedly are highlighted in a draft audit by the DoT s inspector general that also criticizes the FAA s oversight of the carrier as lax  ineffective and inconsistent ",2020-01-30,Seeking Alpha,https://invst.ly/pp5x3,2072484
199453,420969,LUV,Southwest Airlines Posts Solid Quarter Despite Heavy Exposure to Boeing s MAX,news,"If there s one thing long term investors love to see  it s resilience in the face of adversity  Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  managed that last year  the results evident after the company capped another banner year of performance  Let s dive into the key takeaways from Southwest s fourth quarter and full year 2019 results to get a better sense of the company s handling amid a crisis 
Keeping its composure
2019 was a great example of how solid management and a great balance sheet can help lead a company through the rough times   This is our 49th year and there  at least in my experience  there is no more remarkable year than 2019   said CEO Gary C  Kelly during the fourth quarter conference call  continuing 

The grounding of effectively 75 of our airplanes which is about 10  of our fleet presents a crisis like challenge  and our people are ready for it with the best planning  tools and technologies in our history  but more importantly with the right fortitude and the right resolve to get through this crisis  


While it s not always a good idea to take management s musings for granted  the company s ability to stomach  828 million of operating income losses throughout 2019 and still deliver record earnings per share of  4 27 is impressive considering the groundings persisted through nearly 10 full months of 2019  At the current stock price  earnings per share of  4 27 give Southwest Airlines a P E ratio of 13 1  which is on the high end for airlines but vastly lower than the P E of the S P 500  which currently sits at around 24  
Investors should note that Southwest reached a confidential agreement with Boeing  NYSE BA  that essentially discounts the cost basis for owned and future purchases of the MAX  but Southwest will continue to incur damages in 2020 as long as the MAX is grounded  Boeing is basically giving Southwest a coupon on the purchasing and owning of its planes  which will help Southwest in the long term  
A crisis indeed
Southwest s problem negatively affects its customers as well as its earnings  The company has already canceled flying the MAX until June 6  uncomfortably close to the peak annual travel season of June through August  Southwest is the most exposed U S  airline to the MAX groundings and the only major U S  airline that operates an exclusively Boeing fleet  Although the company was able to perform in 2019  it s going to be another challenging year if the MAX remains grounded through the summer travel season  especially considering Southwest was expecting to have 75 MAX aircraft by the end of 2019 and 38 additional deliveries in 2020  If the MAX remains grounded well into the summer travel season  Southwest will have a severely understaffed fleet for most of 2019  likely crippling earnings  Southwest expects the problem to only persist in a timeline of months  not years 
As far as a relationship with Boeing  Kelly made it clear   There is no change in our efforts to evaluate the risk reward of a single aircraft type or supplier  We ll do that  It s just a lower 2020 priority   That being said  if Southwest is forced to remove the MAX from its third quarter 2020 flight schedule  it will be a repeat of fourth quarter 2019  which resulted in fewer flights during peak travel periods 
Long term financial strength
By now  it should be clear that Southwest is doing what it can to handle the MAX groundings  but the company s earnings will continue to be heavily affected    arguably more than any other airline    due to Southwest s single supplier strategy and exposure to the MAX  In terms of financials  though  Southwest retains its status as one of the most elite airlines 

LUV Price to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts 
2019 generated a record  3 4 billion in free cash flow  FCF   Free cash flow is a means to fund growth outside of typical operations  such as returning cash to shareholders in the form of a dividend or buying back stock  Although not an elite dividend stock  Southwest yields 1 3  and has raised its dividend 200  over the past five years 

LUV Debt to Capital  Annual  data by YCharts 
Compared to its competitors  Southwest has the second lowest price to free cash flow among major U S  airlines at just 10 17 times earnings  But since airlines are capital intensive businesses  it s also important to look at debt  Southwest has the second lowest debt to capital ratio among the cohort and the lowest net long term debt due to its ability to fund its operations through operating cash flow instead of debt financing or equity financing 
Battle hardened
Due to a track record of solid financials and management s ability to steer the company in the right direction amid a crisis  Southwest deserves consideration as a value stock for long term investors  It s one thing to perform in fair weather  but quite another when factors outside of your control come crashing down  2019 and 2020 may provide an excellent case study of an airline s ability to handle safety concerns  but I m sure Southwest would prefer to put this whole thing behind it ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqw3c,2075418
199454,420970,LUV,FAA agrees it must boost safety oversight for Southwest Airlines,news,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski  Reuters    The U S  Federal Aviation Administration says it should have done a better job of ensuring Southwest Airlines Co  N LUV  had certified completion of maintenance on 88 used Boeing 737 jets  as noted in a report by the U S  Transportation Department s Inspector General released on Tuesday  Budget friendly Southwest bought the planes in question between 2013 and 2017 from 16 foreign carriers  The final report  first seen by Reuters  said Southwest operated more than 150 000 flights carrying 17 2 million passengers on the jets without confirmation that required maintenance had been completed   The report said the FAA has not  effectively overseen Southwest Airlines  systems for managing risks  and made 11 recommendations to improve oversight  including retraining inspectors and developing better control over maintenance records and inspector guidance on evaluating air carrier safety culture   While the U S  commercial airline industry is considered safe  with only one fatality in recent years  the FAA is under heightened scrutiny by lawmakers over its relationship with the industry after two crashes overseas on the newer  Boeing Co   N BA  737 MAX killed 346 people and led to that aircraft s global grounding    Given the significant unresolved safety concerns that FAA has identified at Southwest Airlines  it is clear that the agency is not yet effectively navigating the balance between industry collaboration and managing safety risks at the carrier   the report said  The FAA said in a response included with the report it concurred with all 11 recommendations and the inspector general s conclusion that its office overseeing Southwest did not perform in accordance with existing guidance by allowing the 88 planes to enter service and that it  lacked a comprehensive conformity inspection for used aircraft   Southwest told Reuters on Tuesday that eight of the 88 jets remain out of service until needed repairs are completed and that it disagreed with the report s findings  The report chided the FAA  saying the agency  accepted the air carrier s justification that the issues identified were low safety risks    The FAA noted it changed the leadership of its office that oversees Southwest and  continues to address deficiencies in the work functions and culture   The agency has agreed to ensure Southwest  complies with regulatory requirements that the 88 previously owned aircraft conform to U S  aviation standards   Last month  the Wall Street Journal published an article on a draft of the inspector general report  The report also said the FAA violated its own guidance in addressing noncompliance by Southwest on baggage weight and balance data  The FAA agreed to ensure Southwest complies with requirements  On Jan  10  the FAA said it was seeking to impose a  3 92 million fine on Southwest for alleged weight infractions on 21 505 flights on 44 aircraft between May 1  2018 and Aug  9  2018  Southwest has said it is working with the FAA to demonstrate the effectiveness of its controls and seek a resolution on the proposed penalty

199458,420974,LUV,Southwest Airlines  LUV  Misses Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 98 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 11 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 17 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  11 71   A quarter ago  it was expected that this airline would post earnings of  1 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 23  delivering a surprise of 12 84  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Southwest  which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry  posted revenues of  5 73 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 18   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 70 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Southwest shares have lost about 0 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2 8  
What s Next for Southwest 
While Southwest has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Southwest was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter and Annual 2019 Conference Call  My name is Chad and I will be moderating today s call   Operator Instructions At this time I d like to turn the call over to Mr  Ryan Martinez  Managing Director of Investor Relations  Please go ahead  sir Ryan Martinez    Managing Director of Investor RelationsThanks  Chad  And thank you all for joining us  I know it s a busy airline earnings day  but we re going to start out with prepared remarks from Gary Kelly  our Chairman and CEO  Mike Van de Ven  Chief Operating Officer  Tom Nealon  our President  and Tammy Romo  Executive Vice President and CFO  and then we will open it up for Q A A few quick disclaimers  Before we get started here  We will make forward looking statements in our remarks which are based on our current expectations of future performance  And of course  our actual results could differ from current expectations for a number of reasons  We call it out special items in 2018 and we will make reference to 2019 results that compared to prior year non GAAP results  Both of these topics are covered in great detail as always in our earnings release disclosures as well as on our IR website  And we are also providing commentary today regarding the ongoing MAX groundings and our current estimations of timelines and current planning assumptions for 2020  Keep in mind these timelines and estimations could change materially with impacts on the amount of financial damages we incur  our published flight schedule beyond June 6th and our fleet capacity and capex assumptions to name a few With all of that said  we ll go ahead and get started  And I ll turn it over the call to Gary Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Ryan and thanks to everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter and year end 2019 earnings call  Straight away I want to thank our employees  This is our 49th year and there  at least in my experience  there is no more remarkable year than 2019  The grounding of effectively 75 of our airplanes which is about 10  of our fleet presents a crisis like challenge  and our people are ready for it with the best planning  tools and technologies in our history  but more importantly with the right fortitude and the right resolve to get through this crisis Our objectives were to run a great airline  serve our customers exceptionally well  protect our finances and our jobs  and follow through with our capital projects that were under way  and we were able to do all those things  The MAX groundings reduced our annual operating income  828 million  Our earnings were still a record on a per share basis    non GAAP basis at  4 27  and that is truly remarkable  But they would have been 28  higher and 20     27  more than a year ago  but for the MAX  When you can do the math on the stock price effect  but we settle with Boeing for the 2019 MAX groundings and the settlement seems to have zero effect on the price per share by the way  But we also intend to settle up 2020 as well So we re three months later since our last earnings call and unfortunately we re still talking about the MAX unhappily  I m confident about the MAX  More importantly  our pilots are confident about the MAX  Boeing needs to get the work done to get the certification flight done  give the FAA a chance to do their work and unground this airplane  Right now we re scheduled for June 6th return which implies an ungrounding several months before  Boeing surprised us all this week with our June  July predictions about the grounding  and obviously that would make our and other airlines  June dates unworkable  So the timing remains uncertain  And we re working through all of that right now Our goals for 2020  given all of this are very straightforward  We want to return the MAX to service  We want to continue to run a great operation  in fact even better  We want to continue to serve our customers very well with exceptional hospitality and in fact even better  We want to protect our finances and our jobs and continue to keep costs low and slow the rate of inflation and do that even better  We want to settle with Boeing for 2020 compensation  We want to continue on with the capital projects that are under way  And then finally  we want to keep our network intact and continue making what modest tactical adjustments we re able to do Having said all those things and all assumes that demand in the economy remains strong and that oil prices remain stable and low  If we can continue to execute against all these goals  that means that we only have one problem  and that s fleet growth  So with regard to the fleet  we re assuming that the MAX grounding is short lived  meaning there are months to go and not years to go  And with that in mind  we are aggressively pursuing a couple of tactical ideas  Number 1 is mainly our 700 retirement schedule where we have a lot of flexibility  So we re actively deferring retirements where it makes sense Secondly  we re always monitoring the used 737 aircraft market  we ll continue to do that  Our issue is simple  It is our seat growth is not keeping up with demand  much less allowing us to expand and we re losing share  But all that is temporary and we plan to aggressively recapture it once the MAX is ungrounded in our    in a superb position given our return on invested capital  There is no change in our efforts to evaluate the risk reward of a single aircraft type or supplier  We ll do that  It s just a lower 2020 priority  So there is no update there I ll also pre empt the M A question by repeating what I ve said earlier  I do not agree that the MAX crisis compels us to acquire another carrier  We would not overpay  We would not commit us to a course and consistent with our strategy  And of course as is or a policy  we do not comment on rumors or speculation about any M A activity  And then finally  I want to thank our Board for making an amendment for 2019 profit sharing  And even though the Boeing compensation is for 2019  it is not included in 2019 profits and that s not fair to our people for their profit sharing  So as a result of that   124 million was added and of course that reduced our fourth quarter profits  but that makes the total annual profit sharing contribution  a record  667 million and our folks earned it and just wanted to congratulate them  So taking that notable item into account  we d be consistent    consensus So with that quick overview  I d like to turn it over to Mr  Van de Ven to take us through our operations Michael G  Van de Ven    Chief Operating OfficerWell  thanks  Gary  And as Gary was mentioning  given all of our headwinds that we are facing  it was extremely important that we want a reliable customer friendly operation in the fourth quarter and our people certainly delivered  They produced the best overall operation we ve had in over a decade  Our systemwide on time performance for the fourth quarter was 82 4  and we accomplished that with the least amount of block and turn time in the industry  And that s a big factor in our operational efficiency that lowers our cost through superior aircraft utilization  It s a low cost  coupled with the great service that allows us to win On the service front  this was the first quarter where we had bag scanning implemented throughout our domestic network  We emplaned 30 9 million bags in the quarter  and 99 6  of those bags were carried on flights as checked  That is a record fourth quarter performance for Southwest Airlines  And our customers notice through November  Southwest again led the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio as reported by the DOT  And based on our preliminary December results we expect to close out the year in a similar fashion And frankly  our people have been delivering this kind of exceptional service the entire year  And all the while dealing with the significant activities associated with the MAX grounding  So in that environment  we grew our Hawaii service to over 1 million customers in just 9 5 months  We implemented plane side scanning for bags across the domestic network  and we continue to implement technology enhancements across all of our operating and functions  So for all of 2019 excluding Hawaiian Airlines Southwest finished in the top three in the industry  in on time performance and bag handling and with the lowest customer complaint ratio  all as measured by the DOT  and that s the best combined yearly industry performance since 1999  And our people believed that they can improve from there  Through yesterday  our January on time performance was 87 7  that is just a superb start to the year  It s one of our best  In fact  we ve only achieved an 85  January on time performance or better 5 times since 1988 and it s the on time performance that sets the foundation for bag handling for customer complaints and for cost control There is no better team in this industry than our Southwest people and they support our customers  our Company each other and they are just relentless in execution  And they are the heart and the soul and the spirit of Southwest  Now  turning to the MAX for a moment  our guiding principle of relaunching this aircraft continues to be an orderly and controlled manner  one which we can execute with a high degree of confidence and uncertainty  And that s been a critical focal point for our team and we plan and we ve replanned our return to service activities as new information becomes available  So since the beginning of the year we have learned of two significant additional considerations First  the Boeing recommendation for both simulator and CBT training for our pilot prior to their operation of the airplane  And then secondly Boeing s most recent estimate of a mid 2020 return to service date  As you know  we have presently removed all MAX flying from our schedules through June 6th  And with this new information  it seems pretty clear that we re going to need to make further schedule adjustments into the summer  So we re replanning yet again using the best set of facts and insights into all of the necessary activities and we ll make the appropriate adjustments well in advance  so that our customers  travel plans aren t significantly disrupted We have 34 MAX aircraft on our operating certificate  They are in Southwest Airlines  control and they re stored in Victorville  California  Those aircraft must go through maintenance and make ready work before they re ready for service  We also have 27 MAX aircraft that Boeing has built and are being stored by Boeing until the aircraft are certified to fly  Those 27 must still go through the delivery and acceptance process  in addition to any make ready work to be added to the Southwest Airlines operating certificate  Those combined 61 aircraft are our most reliable source of lift once the aircraft is clear to fly And as I ve stated in earlier calls  we believe that we can manage around 5 to 10 aircraft a week from this collective pool to be reintroduced to the operation  So it will take at least a couple of months for those aircraft to return to service  And our crewing is in place today to operate them  Boeing still contractually owes us 51 more aircraft this year  That s the 2019 carryover  plus the 2020 deliveries  And with their production line shutdown  the delivery quantities and the dates are in flux  We re going to continue discussions with them to work through what s reasonable for both of us as their plans become better defined So turning to training  Our initial training plans include the 30 day period for all of our pilots to complete the expected CBT training before we begin flying the aircraft and revenue service  Boeing is now recommending the additional simulator training  and the training requirements will be finalized at a later date  after the JOEB completes their testing  These requirements will dictate the time it takes for us to complete our pilot training  We currently have three MAX sims on property  and we have worked with our simulator manufacturer CAE to provide us with three additional MAX simulators to be trading ready before the summer  That will give us at least six MAX simulators available for training by the time the aircraft is released to fly  and that will significantly reduce our training times from where we started Beyond the six  we have three more simulator deliveries planned for the second half of 2020  and we re working on expected in service dates for them  That will close 2020 for us with 9 MAX simulators  I cannot thank CAE enough for their partnership and support  We have had a strong relationship with them for many  many years  and they have helped create one of the leading flight ops training centers in the world  Assuming for a second to the simulator training may be two hours  This as a baseline  it will take us at least of a couple of additional months from where we were to get all of our pilots through that training  So there is still a lot of moving parts to nail down the return to service plan  The FAA is in control of the regulatory ungrounding process  and our plans begin once they clear the aircraft to fly  From that date  we are assuming it will take several weeks to get our manuals updated in our CMO to approve our changes and then once that is accomplished  we can begin training our pilots and bringing the aircraft into their operational state  And as I mentioned  it will take at least a couple of additional months before the aircraft are ready for revenue service when our pilots are trained In the meantime  we still plan on performing extensive validation flights to work out any effects of the aircraft presenting so long to also reintroducing to our people and to make sure we are completely comfortable with the aircraft performance before any customer set foot on the aircraft Wrapping up  our operation is running very  very well  We have a detailed plan to relaunch the MAX  and we ll be adjusting and as we get better information  Our people are taking great care of our customers and each other  and they re delivering a safe  reliable product  They are the best team that I have ever been around  and it is a pleasure to support them And with that  over to you  Tom Tom Nealon    PresidentOkay  Thank you  Mike  Hey  I just really have to like to echo Mike and Gary  and also share my congratulations and my thanks to all of our employees  They are absolute warriors  and they are Southwest heroes  2019 was a very challenging year with the MAX  But we also had a great year  We really to have a great year and our people across every workgroup just kept rising to the challenge time and time and time again When the MAX is grounded as Gary said in March of last year  we were very clear about our priorities  First  we are absolutely committed to running a great operation  We re absolutely focused on taking great care of our customers and third  we are very focused on delivering very strong financial results  and we did all three  And we did it very  very well  As Mike said  the operation was rock solid  arguably the best operation in a decade  Also  as Mike said  our DOT customer SAT scores at the very top of the industry  or when you didn t say is  keep in mind  that s the year we had to proactively we accommodate literally  literally millions of customers And our brand scores also remain the highest in the industry and among the highest in the world for any company  not just airlines  So the customer service and the hospitality that we re still famous for is stronger than ever and our people just continue to take great care of our customers and one another Our fourth quarter RASM results were right in line with our original October guidance of flat to up 2   Our fourth quarter revenue grew 40 basis points to a record of  5 7 billion  and that was despite a nearly 1  declining capacity  and we also grew our RASM 1 3   which is also a record performance  Our base business was very strong and was a driver of our Q4 RASM performance  and this was really the result of strength in both demand and yield  We also had very strong performance in our other revenues  more specifically our rep rewards program performed very well  which we ll talk about more just a minute  We also had very strong performance from our early bird and upgraded boarding products  both of which had double digit growth for the quarter Now  they said on our third quarter call  we made the decision in the fall of 2019 to republish our November and December schedules really with two objectives in mind  First  I want to minimize any customer disruption and inconvenience during the holiday travel season  And second  we want to ensure    ran a great operation with lower capacity  And we achieved both objectives  But we also knew that we weren t optimizing RASM for the peak versus off peak seasonality of the fourth quarter  And as expected  the 2 points to 3 points of temporary year over year RASM benefit that we saw on the third quarter from the removal of the MAX  It didn t occur in the fourth quarter because of the sub optimized Q4 schedules  Now  none of that was a surprise to us  The net effect of this is that there was no material year over year MAX impact to Q4 RASM  which again is what we expected and share with you in the last call  And I got to say once again our network planning team just did a phenomenal job of developing workable solutions to protect the strength of our network and to minimize customer disruption and the same call out to our revenue management team  did equally incredible job of managing the revenue  yields droving the quarter  We also had very strong revenue growth in our other revenues Our Rapid Rewards program continues to perform extremely well  For the full year  our other revenue grew nearly 1   Phonetic  and the fourth quarter performance was a strong 9  growth  And we are continuing to see record passenger mix continued    I m sorry  we re seeing the reward pass through mix continue to grow  which really speaks to the strength and the value of the program to our customers Now  we re also continuing to see very strong growth in spending on our co brand credit cards and the sheer size and growth of our credit card portfolio is very healthy  with nearly double digit growth and very low attrition  So we continue to be very pleased with the economics and the structure of our program  as well as with our partnership with Chase So to sum up Q4  the bottom line is very simple  very steady  strong demand for both leisure and business  continued strength in pricing  strengthening our other revenues and continued industry leading strength in our customer and brand scores  The story line for Q1 is very similar to what we experienced in Q4  The underlying trends around demand and pricing that we experienced in Q4 have continued into Q1  Everything that we re seeing for the quarter shows very solid shopping and bookings  So demand remained solid for both leisure and business travel  and pricing also remains steady and strong  So we have a very good read on first quarter revenue and RASM trends  Obviously  we continue to be impacted by the MAX  we pull the MAX out of our April schedule  which runs through June 6 And as you know  marches the peak month in the first quarter and our MAX aircraft deficit grows from 34 aircraft in March of 2019 to roughly 60 aircraft short by March of 2020  Now that said in Q1  we don t have the flight schedule variations and the capacity demand mismatch complications that we had in the fourth quarter  So because of that  we expect to 2 point year over year RASM benefit in Q1 from the MAX cancellations  We also have roughly 1 5 points year over year RASM tailwinds in the first quarter from prior year negative impacts  one point due to the government shutdown and 0 5 points  due to the unscheduled maintenance cancellations in Q1 of last year So based on the strength of our base business as well as the Q1 MAX RASM impact and the year over year tailwinds  we expect a strong Q1 RASM performance in the range of up 3 5  to 5 5   I ve said this before by thinking us worth repeating  as we continue adjusting the quite schedules of the MAX cancellations  Our focus is to maintain depth and frequency of service to key markets  and we re also very focused on maintaining a high degree of point to point direct flying as well as maintaining high quality connecting itineraries  Now when you look at our schedule  you ll see that we ve trimmed some capacity from longer haul markets  We ve added more capacity into our short and medium offline  which is a real core strength of our network Just to be clear in no way  we re walking away from long haul flying  But with the MAX out of service  we have opportunities to replace profitable  but below system average RASM long haul  non stop itineraries with high quality connecting itineraries  We will do that  And with the strength of our point to point network  we have the flexibility to do that  Now once the MAX returns to service  we ll certainly restore the vast majority of flights have been taken out of our schedules and will do so in a way that lines up with our operations and commercial objectives We have the world s largest and strongest point to point network  and we intend to leverage our cost structure and our scale and we certainly intend to resume our growth  And we tell you we have a long runway of growth opportunities still in front of us  Now despite the MAX cancellations  we have continued to add additional place in the some of our key markets  We have near term growth focus  We will continue to be in Baltimore  Denver  Houston  Hawaii  Hawaii continues to perform very well for both long haul and inter island markets  and this is totally consistent with our plans and our expectations  Looking beyond Q1  obviously our 2020 growth will be determined by the MAX return to service and until that occurs  this continued to adjust our plans accordingly  And our objectives are no different than what they were in 2019  We run a great operation  We ll take great care of our customers and will deliver strong financials And as Mike alluded to  if we need to make further adjustments to our June schedule  which runs from June 7 through early August  we ll do so and that would likely include further trends toward non stop long haul flights and potentially a modest thinning of high frequency markets  which is essentially the same playbook that we ve been running for the past several schedules  We also have a full pipeline of revenue and cost initiatives  most of which we won t discuss yet for competitive reasons  but I can tell you the run track implement our new GDS capabilities for corporate travel by midyear with Travelport and Amadeus  which we expect to drive incremental EBITDA between  10 million and  20 million in the second half of 2020  And there is clearly a very large opportunity to grow that substantially over the next several years So that s where we are  Q1 is off to a strong start  Trends remain strong  And we re guiding our RASM be up 3 5  to 5 5   And once the MAX returns to service  we are ready to bring it back into service with all the operational and commercial discipline that you are expecting Southwest Airlines So with that  I m going to turn it over to Tammy Tammy Romo    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Tom  and hello everyone  I d also like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous effort  managing through a very challenging year  The MAX groundings have had a significant impact on our Company  But our employees continue to rise to the occasion  and the strong results we reported this morning simply would not have been possible without their hard work and incredible focus and teamwork  With the MAX returned to service timeline shifting frequently  it has been difficult to anchor our full year 2020 forecast to support meaningful guidance for the full year  so I ll focus primarily on first quarter guidance and my comments today regarding our cost performance  fleet capacity and capex plans  and our strong financial position During fourth quarter  as Gary covered  we reached a confidential agreement with Boeing for compensation related to 2019 financial damages due to the MAX groundings  the compensation from Boeing will be accounted for as a reduction of the purchase price of our 31 owned MAX aircraft and future MAX from orders  which reduces property and equipment on our balance sheet and will result in lower depreciation expense over the useful life of the aircraft In light of this agreement  our Board of Directors authorized a  124 million pre tax profit sharing awards  This incremental award was accrued in fourth quarter and reduced fourth quarter earnings by  97 million or  0 18 per diluted share as we covered in the release  A record  264 million in fourth quarter profit sharing expense included a  124 million discretionary award and will be paid later this quarter as part of the record  667 million full year 2019 profit sharing distribution to employees Now that I ve covered profit sharing  I ll go ahead and cover fuel costs before I move into our cost performance  excluding fuel and profit sharing  Our fourth quarter fuel price of  2 09 per gallon decreased  0 16 or 7 1  year over year and that s primarily due to a roughly an 8  decrease in market prices  We have a great fuel hedging protection in place this year with a 60  hedge for first quarter and a 59  hedge for full year 2020 We ve been adding some protection to future years and are currently about 54  hedged for 2021 and about 31  hedged for 2022  We also recently began adding modest protection to 2023 and expect to continue our systematic approach to building a meaningful multi year hedging portfolio at a reasonable cost to provide some insurance on    around    was about a third of our cost structure  For first quarter 2020  based on market prices as of January 17  we expect our fuel price to be in the range of  2 05 to  2 15 per gallon  with a modest  0 01 hedging gain at current prices Our fuel efficiency continues to be significantly impacted by the MAX groundings  We came into 2019 expecting a solid year over year improvement in our fuel efficiency  largely driven by the operating performance of the 75 MAX aircraft we should have had in 2019  As a reminder  the MAX produces a 20  fuel burn improvement over our retired classic fleet and a 14  improvement over our NG fleet  However  our fourth quarter and full year 2019 ASMs per gallon declined 0 8   so we lost some ground last year We ll continue to be impacted until the return of the MAX and first quarter 2020 ASMs per gallon are also expected to decline year over year in the range of down 2  to 3   We look forward to reversing this trend and getting back on track with our fuel efficiency improvement goal  Excluding fuel and profit sharing  the 5  year over year increase in our fourth quarter CASM ex was right in line with our most recent guidance  And as we outlined in our release  the primary driver of the year over year increase was the temporary underutilization of overhead  combined with the lower than planned capacity from the MAX grounding  For full year 2019  our CASM ex increased 7 7  year over year  The MAX grounding impact drove approximately 5 points of this year over year inflation  which is what we expected Excluding the MAX impact  our cost control was very solid with core year over year 2019 unit cost performance slightly below our original CASM ex guidance range of 3  to 3 5   And that includes the incremental  10 million of maintenance expense to keep seven of the  700 aircraft that we were originally going to retire in 2019  as well as the incremental  42 million ratification true up for our mechanics contract Looking at first quarter of 2020  we expect our CASM ex to increase in the 6  to 8  range year over year  Our outlook includes an estimated 7 point unit cost penalty from the MAX groundings as our fleet deficit grows relative to our cost base  We will continue to have temporarily unabsorbed overhead that will be utilized upon the MAX return to service  Setting the MAX aside  our first quarter CASM ex outlook would also include 1 point to 2 points of inflation  primarily due to increases in salary wages and benefits  maintenance expense and operating expenses related to technology and facility investments  As you know  we have year over year tailwinds related to the first quarter of 2019 impacts  associated with the ratified labor agreement with our mechanics and costs associated with unscheduled maintenance disruption and flight cancellations  which offsets inflationary pressures here in first quarter Turning to an overview of our fleet plan  this has obviously been a focus for us this year with the MAX grounding  So  I ll spend a little more time walking you through all the moving parts  Prior to the MAX groundings  our 2019 plans were for 44 MAX deliveries  that was 37 MAX 8s and seven MAX 7s  along with 18  700 retirements  This would have resulted in a fleet of 776 at year end 2019  Instead  we had three MAX 8 deliveries  plus six  700 retirements and therefore ended 2019 with a total fleet of 747 aircraft  We took delivery of three 737 MAX 8 aircraft in first quarter before the MAX groundings in mid March  We have not taken any delivery since then and as a result  we decided to postpone seven of the 18 planned retirement for 2019 to help mitigate a portion of our fleet deficit  We ll operate these seven aircraft for around two more years and they are scheduled to retire by the end of 2021  Of the remaining 11  700 retirements planned for 2019  we retired six of them  one in third quarter and five during fourth quarter  The remaining five retirements have shifted to first half of 2020 We have not updated our contractual delivery schedule with Boeing  The 41 MAX aircraft that we didn t receive in 2019  are still in flux  But in our contractual order book schedule shown in our earnings release this morning  we reflected 40 of those deliveries as part of our 2020 firm orders and one as a 2021 firm order  However  I will provide some context as far as our current planning assumptions  because we do not expect to receive 78 aircraft deliveries at this point in 2020  The news from Boeing two days ago that the MAX will likely not return to service until mid 2020 has us now reevaluating our fleet and capacity plans further  Mike has already taken you through some of the details of our MAX return to service plans and he referenced the two sources of MAX aircraft that we are currently focused on as part of our 2020 fleet planning assumptions  Mike is working through the plan to safely return the 34 MAX 8s already in our fleet and we will also be working with Boeing and the FAA to deliver the 27 MAX 8 aircraft that are built and in storage At this juncture  our current planning scenario is for 27 MAX deliveries in 2020  That brings us to around 60 MAXs which we are currently staffed to operate  We also expect to retire 16  700 aircraft this year  the five that shifted from 2019 and 11 more planned throughout the year  This is less than the 20 to 25 that we previously communicated and that s simply due to the slower assumed ramp up of MAX production and delivery catch up  We will invest approximately  12 million this year into those 11 aircraft that we re extending for a few years  Based on our planning assumption that I walked through  we would add a modest 11 net aircraft to our fleet in 2020 at 758 total aircraft Of course  we don t have certainty on the timing of the MAX return to service  the production timeline from Boeing or our aircraft delivery timeline  So  this is all subject to change and we ll keep you updated accordingly  Shifting to capacity  fourth quarter 2019 ASMs declined 0 9  year over year  which as expected  was about 8 points lower than our original plan  Our full year 2019 capacity declined 1 6  year over year and was significantly lower than our original plan to grow nearly 5  in 2019  For first quarter 2020  we currently expect our ASM capacity to decline in the range of down 1 5  to 2 5  year over year  We currently have MAX flying removed through June 6  but with Boeing s latest guidance  we ll likely extend our MAX related flight adjustments further  So  based on the flight schedule adjustments through June 6  we expect second quarter 2020 capacity to increase no more than 2  So  now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow  we ended the quarter with robust cash and short term investments of approximately  4 1 billion  Our cash balance continues to be higher than what we usually carry  as we haven t been making aircraft delivery payments since mid March 2019  Delayed delivery payments also lowered our capex to  1 billion in 2019 versus our original plan of  1 9 billion to  2 billion  The majority of the 2019 spend related to technology and facility investment  And  we also received a  400 million in supplier proceeds  which we consider an offset to our capital expenditures  For 2020  if you assume we get the 27 MAX 8s from Boeing that are already built for us  that would result in total capex of approximately  1 4 billion to  1 5 billion  which is net of a supplier proceeds owed to us at year end 2019 Our cash flow generation in 2019 was very strong  despite the  828 million operating income reduction due to the MAX groundings  During 2019  we generated  4 billion in operating cash flow and a record  3 4 billion in free cash flow  with  2 billion of share repurchases and  372 million in dividends  We have  1 35 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization  net of the  550 million accelerated share repurchase currently under way  that is expected to wrap up no later than mid February  We have very healthy cash and liquidity  low leverage  manageable debt obligations this year and remain focused on a balanced approach to investing in our employees and the Company and returning cash and value to our shareholders In closing  I d like to extend another huge thank you to all of our employees  Taking into consideration the significant impact the MAX grounding had on our operational and financial performance  our 2019 results were truly superb  We did not lose ground on our very strong financial position  maintaining our investment grade balance sheet  ample liquidity  strong cash flows and healthy shareholder returns  And we also continue investing in our business and we re well positioned for the future Absent the impact of the MAX groundings and first quarter 2019 unique items  we achieved our unit revenue growth goal of greater than 3  for 2019  Likewise  we beat our unit cost guidance for 2019  which is just tremendous  Of course  the MAX did significantly impact 2019 and 2020 will also be significantly impacted by the ongoing MAX situation  but our focus on solid execution remains unchanged We look forward to getting past these near term challenges and temporary headwinds  safely returning the MAX to commercial service and leveraging our low cost and robust route network to resume our growth  So  with that  Chad  we are ready to take analyst questions Questions and Answers OperatorCertainly  We will now begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  And the first question will come from Andrew Didora with Bank of America  Please go ahead Andrew Didora    Bank of America    AnalystHi  good afternoon  everyone  and thank you for the questions  Tammy  seems like you were able to offset the 1 point to 2 points of inflationary pressures in 1Q  partially due to some of the easier comps  I think  partially due to maybe some of your    the cost initiatives that you have  But going forward  do you think you have a similar ability the rest of the year  which would allow you to keep    I guess  do you think you have a similar ability the rest of the year to continue to offset these cost pressures and keep it more contained to what the MAX impact is or do you think the inflation will continue to ramp over the course of the year  Thanks Tammy Romo    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks for your question  Andrew  So  yes  we certainly have abnormal capacity trends this year again  but as we drill down into our core costs and strip out the estimated impact of the MAX grounding and all the other noise  we do see core business unit cost inflation in that  call it  close to 2  range  That said  we don t know exactly when the MAX will return and our second half 2020 capacity plan is very much in flux  So  again  that s our best read at this point We ve reported our analysis of the unit cost impact each quarter from the MAX groundings  So along those lines  we ve done our best to get a sense of what our true CASM ex run rate is from 2019 to 2020  So  normalizing for the MAX and the other unique items for both 2019 and 2020  we believe we could have reached our CASM ex year over year growth in 2020 of less than 2   which is in line with our goal  but admittedly we have a lot of moving parts to try to tease out So  I guess  in summary  I d just say I m very pleased with how we executed against our cost plan in 2019 and we are very focused on being even more efficient  So  I think it s reasonable to assume or think we should be able to improve our trajectory here in  20 relative 2019 excluding the MAX  But just again  including the MAX  obviously the year over year comparisons are very skewed and we re incurring costs that we didn t expect such as extending retirement and incurring the related maintenance investment and have some timing items such as deferring flight crew hiring from 2019 into 2020  etc  But overall  I m just really proud of our folks there  really doing a great job with their budgets in controlling costs And I ll add by just saying  we re all definitely looking forward to be the safe return of the MAX  resuming our growth  utilizing our unabsorbed overhead and beginning to reverse the temporary unit cost penalties of that we re incurring  So thank you again for your question Andrew Didora    Bank of America    AnalystGreat  Thank you for that detail  Tammy  And then maybe my second question  just for Gary or for Mike  Okay  I know it s difficult to comment on full year capacity given by the moving pieces  but based on what Mike explained in his prepared remarks  what could growth look like once the MAX returns to service  Could it be that high single digit growth rate that I think many were maybe expecting few months back  And then how does sim training change the timeline for a full kind of return to optimal utilization for your fleet  Thanks Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerTammy  you re probably in the best position to answer that  We    Andrew  as you know  we didn t put    we purposely did not put any guidance for the year being for the obvious reasons  but Tammy  would you like to answer that Tammy Romo    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s right  Yeah  It is tough to answer  for other reasons we ve all laid out  In terms of the second quarter  we ve given you our guidance there for ASM growth  If you strip out the    if you assume the MAX gets pushed beyond the second quarter  I just offer that probably gets you to roughly flat capacity year over year for the second quarter  And then really is just a function of the return to service plan And we told you  we ve got a good line    line of sight on the 61 airplanes  Mike has walked you through the ramping of all of that  which is several month process  And from there  it s really  I think based on the production rates from Boeing  which we just don t know the answer to that question  yet  So it s just premature to try to guess what the capacity ramp up year over year could be here in the second half of the year Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think Mike pointed this out  But so  Mike  you might want to comment  but we    just to be clear  we re staffed  we re resourced  We got gates etc   for 61 more airplanes  And so  but what we have a line of sight on is  you got the 34 we own  27 that Boeing has  The issue is  there are 16 retirements that are coming  So to get to fill up 61 airplanes worth of flying  We d have to get 16 more beyond the 61 airplanes from Boeing and whether we will get those in 2020 Mike  I don t think we know  So I think that s possible  So the point that I wanted to make with that is  we want to get 31 airplanes into service as fast as we can and that is all understanding that it needs to be safe  It needs to meet all of our other objectives  etc  But we ll want to get to that 61  Just as fast as we can  We just don t know what that speed will be and some of it may be us  We may find that we want to gate  We want to gate the flow of airplanes back into that operation  More than what we know right now  but hopefully that gives you a little bit of insight But if you draw any 31  one is certainly not going to be 10   There is no way  Nothing close to that  And 2021 as I get the same  same kinds of concern  so we re not so worry about the percent right now through as much as you are  But we re certainly not going to be growing rapidly here in 2020 Andrew Didora    Bank of America    AnalystUnderstood  thanks for the color OperatorThe next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James  Please go ahead Savi Syth    Raymond James    AnalystHey  good afternoon  Just a follow up  Mike to clarify the color that you gave about the MAX  And I know there s a lot of uncertainty there on the return to service but the color is helpful  but make sure I understand  It sounds like including the manual updates and kind of the concurrent training and maintenance assuming it s only a two hours  there is a lot assumptions there  it s about four weeks from certification to or at least four weeks from certification to when you can get the aircraft    sorry four weeks more than the kind of two months that you had mentioned before  to get the aircraft up and running  Is that right  And then also just  would you be willing to kind of train a subset of pilots if it means that you can get to the MAX off the ground sooner Michael G  Van de Ven    Chief Operating OfficerYeah  so just maybe to give you a little bit more color on that  when there were    what we were thinking about when there was just a requirement of CBT time  There is a period of time  There are really three things  getting the manuals approved  so once there is a return to service date  we need to get the manuals  we get it    you get all changes in our manuals and we need to have the    our CMO sign off on all that  And that could take three weeks  let s say  three to four weeks to get that done  Once that s done  we can begin executing on the plan  And the plan is twofold  get the airplanes into their proper maintenance state  get the pilots trained When there was just CBT training  we could get pilots trained within 30 days  Now that there is a potential for simulator training  I think that could add at least a couple of months to that date  So that is the    that s the challenge with the CBT training  And that lays over really with the aircraft time at the same time  So that    hope that gives you a little bit of color from where we were to kind of where we are today  To be able to subset a group of pilots to bring the airplanes back earlier  we would need systems  we would mean procedures  and then we would need an adjustment to our    a pilot contract to allow how all that works  So there is a lot of work with that  We re exploring opportunities in that area  but there is just a lot of risk and uncertainty with all of that  So that s not an easy task  either Savi Syth    Raymond James    AnalystThat makes sense  Sorry   Michael G  Van de Ven    Chief Operating OfficerBut in the end  you mash all that together and really compared to what we were assuming before  compared to simulator training and again another shout out to CAE who has been terrific to work with  We ll have a significant amount of simulator capacity  if that s the route that we need to go  And it will add a couple of months  Yeah  did work for you  Phonetic   So based and you said it  there are lot of assumptions there  but just trying to give you some guidance  so we won t be up and running immediately after an ungrounding  it will be several months later And the other    and then lastly  I just want to make clear also is  we will have the year before that    that  we re talking about revenue service there  which I know that s what you re interested in  Before that  we re going to try it  We will do validation flights out there  so that we can make sure that everything that is occurred on those airplanes    they re flying  they re maintained  we ve got all the cobwebs knocked out of them for such a long term storage  So we will also be    so the airplanes will be    up in the air flying before them Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo we can do that  in other words  without having trained our entire core pilots Savi Syth    Raymond James    AnalystThanks  Now that s helpful  And I think I misspoke  I meant four months  So it sounds like roughly speaking from some recertifications  And then maybe  Tammy  just a clarification on the kind of Boeing  the kind of lower cost that you re going to get from these compensation  Is some of that already flowing through for the aircraft that you own and are grounded today  So it s    some of it s already reflected and that will continue to build as you go out  And then also just wondering if you could provide the    a breakout of the fair value for the fuel hedges between    for 2021 Tammy Romo    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Savi  The    just to answer your question first on the compensation  So it s really pretty straight forward  The compensation will be allocated to the 34 aircraft that we have grounded  So we ll get some benefit of that here more immediately  and is more for next year  actually for this year now in the millions  call it  maybe  5 million for this year  And then   Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerLower depreciation Tammy Romo    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerLower depreciation expense  and then as we bring on the aircraft deliveries in the future that will simply be spread over the useful life of the aircraft  So the benefit will be realized or obviously over many years here  So  but that s kind of short and simple explanation of how that s going to rollout Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd so  and we don t have  for the 2020 settlement that we keep talking about  there is nothing factored into any of our   Tammy Romo    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s right Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerForward comments for that  So the only thing that s in 2020 is related to the deal that was done for 2019 Tammy Romo    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s correct  So thanks  Gary  And then on your second question  I guess we laid out in terms of the fair value that  it was  2 million for the first quarter and  31 million for the remainder  So  just the way that rolled out is in 2021  There is    we ll call it roughly another  40 million  2022  It s in the same neighborhood of  40 million  And then in  23  it s less than  10 million Savi Syth    Raymond James    AnalystAll right  Very helpful  Thanks  guys OperatorThe next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research  Please go ahead Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    AnalystHey  everybody  Thank you for the time  Hey  Gary  you are a never say never guy  so you might not like this question  But I would challenge you  what were some things  one or two things that you think you re fairly sure  Southwest will never do as long as you re CEO  And I asked this question  because I m pretty sure something like we re never going to have basic economy  a month or two ago  So just  I d like to know what is in that never category as long as you re CEO Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerHunter  I d love all your questions always  And I don t know    I don t know if I can give you a comprehensive list of the nevers  And you are right  I am a never say never  but I don t see us ever charging for bag fees  And obviously one of these days  somebody else could view that differently  We re not going to do basic economy  We ve tried    there s been a couple of media stories that were way off  So we ve tried to clean some of that up  but we won t be doing basic economy  And I don t know  Tammy  I m sure  there s some of the things that we won t do  I don t    I don t see us certainly in the near future doing  well  I don t know  I was going to say something I probably shouldn t say  So I won t say it Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    AnalystMy follow up question then  Gary is  yeah  sorry  my follow up is that  please tell me what you re going to say just now Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerLet me say  you re always asking questions  And that one  I won t answer Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    AnalystAll right  All right  thanks  And then just real quick  I mean obviously you said second fleet type decision is not for now  That s later discussion  I get it  But can you just run me about just the CBA restrictions around adding a second fleet type  Is that a gating item  just for a decision to be made across multiple CBAs  Or is that something that can happen concurrently  just sort of pragmatically order of operations with regard to your CBAs  Thanks a lot Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell  yeah  we would need to collaborate with our employees and especially our pilots  I think all that is contemplated with what Mike and I have been thinking about  whether it s a gating factor  it needs to be collaborative  So yeah  I don t know if gating is exactly the right word  but we would need to be thinking about it comprehensively  I think our pilots would be interested in supporting the Company in terms of growth in the most economical manner  because selfishly it means more jobs for them  It means more upgrades for captain So as long as we can conclude that and then convince them that  that is the right case  I think we can come to an agreement on that  But Tammy and I were talking earlier this morning about this  And for us to have to arrive at a different course of action here with the fleet  we ve got to have the right timing to meet our needs in terms of additional airplanes  We ve got to have the right product  And it s got to come at the right price  So those are all the three  maybe two of the three at least  are pretty big hurdles to overcome  I think if we were to reverse this and we hadn t shared with you all that we re going to explore the risk reward and having a single fleet type single supplier  I think you d be asking us  This sort of illustrates the risk of having all of your eggs in one basket  So I think we have a duty to look at that  We are going to look at it very seriously  And I think we have to be realistic that this can be a hard hurdle to overcome So I don t know at least  Hunter  in the way I m thinking about it  I don t see the threshold question being the CBA  I think the threshold question is  does this makes sense for us or not and if it does  we ll then    you sort of knock down the other barriers that are out there  but our pilots are great and they re fantastic  and I certainly don t see that as a hurdles or obstacle Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  Thank you  Gary Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYes sir OperatorThe next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan  Please go ahead Jamie Baker    JPMorgan    AnalystAre you re saying there s a chance for hot meals Michael G  Van de Ven    Chief Operating OfficerHow did you know Jamie Baker    JPMorgan    AnalystThat s what I heard  Sorry  I was    the confidentiality around the Boeing settlement  so let s focus on 2020 which has not been settled  How do you calculate or try to calculate the impact  You merely look at a pre shutdown business plan and compare it to actual results  Do you focus on some trailing pre tax margin calculus  Do you make adjustments for the fact that your growth abled competitors  Now  we ll have over a year s jump in certain markets  and it s going to cost something to win that share back  I m not asking about what you and Boeing might settle on  I m just wondering how you think about what your entitlement is Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think it s a very fair question  I don t know that    you know and we know that this is in the negotiation  This is not contractual  This is in negotiation  so I don t see being selfish about this  I don t see a lot of merit or wisdom and as laying out our entire strategy about this  I also don t want to give our competitors a roadmap  What I don t    if you just simply talk about the harm that the Company has incurred  I wouldn t quarrel with anything that you put out there  And as I mentioned in my remarks  there is a lot of years  Jamie  where we ve had a dozen issues that we needed to deal with  And right now  we ve been blessed with having one  The operation is fantastic  And I won t tick through everything that  that the four of us have been trying to drive home today  but the Company is in a really  really good shape  We have one problem  And it s a serious one  and the sitting here or dog paddling for a year  while our competitors grow right past us is costing us this year 6 million or 7 million customers Yeah  I m very worried about that  And that s not anything that we can mitigate  We can deal with the operation  We can deal with always other things  We got the finances whole  so to speak  But that we can t do anything about until we get airplanes  until we can grow again  And it s    so am I    do I think we ve been harmed  Absolutely  And everybody knows  we re going to see compensation from Boeing and I ll just    if you don t mind  I ll just put a period on it Jamie Baker    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  Sure  sure  That helps  I appreciate it  When I think about MAX impacted airlines around the globe  you re clearly one of the most profitable if not the most profitable  So put differently  other customers are desperate to get MAX as there is no doubt that you want them  but as you point out  it s not like your margins have collapsed  So as Boeing jiggers around the Skyline  would Southwest have any interest in letting some of your delivery slots go to the needy for lack of a better term  or is it mandatory that you get what you are entitled to as fast as humanly possible Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  It s somewhat philosophical I assume  But I think this is a really good company  and I think part of the reason that we re able to absorb the blow is because of five decades worth of preparation  And we went through 9 11 and I can vividly remember our competitors whining about their state and that was their fault they weren t prepared work for the unexpected without trying to be too harsh here  but we shouldn t be penalized because we have run a great company for five decades taking care of all of our constituents  especially our shareholders  we shouldn t be penalized for that  I wouldn t be    I wouldn t be serving all of our stakeholders today if we simply said  oh  well  because we re not on the verge of collapse  we should forfeit these positions that makes no sense to me  So  no  I wouldn t do that at all  I would say quite the contrary  I think that Boeing has benefited in the 737 program  has benefited mightily because of Southwest Airlines  and our success over five decades Jamie Baker    JPMorgan    AnalystVery clear  Thank you  Gary Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYes  sir OperatorAnd the next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI  Please go ahead Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore ISI    AnalystThank you  Understand estimates are exactly that and I think we understand how you get your arms around the cost impact from the MAX being out  But just for argument sake  how you estimate the RASM benefit  As I think about some of the hard choices  you ve had to make  cutting your worst flying  focusing on your best and combined with basically no capacity growth  It feels like the RASM benefit could be very  very substantial  So for example  in the fourth quarter in the press release  I think you called out 2 point to 3 point tailwind from the MAX being grounded  what does that compare to like  What would capacity growth have been and how do you get to that number Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell  it s    you re right  Our estimates  and I think by definition is sort of a with and without and you don t know what it    we admit  we don t know exactly what life would have been like with 75 more airplanes as of the end of the year  but I think our folks through    Tom through the year has been consistent and pointing out that  yeah  we are not growing capacity and arguably  there is some benefit from that at least temporarily  but the way we ve had to reproduce schedules has been grossly inefficient and put our revenue management and a really tough position  because we re not building up bookings in a normal way  and we re reaccommodating people at low prices  The fourth quarter  of course  was unique with the gosh  over 3  was added back for lack of precision in the scheduling  So it was wholly inefficient in the fourth quarter So anyway  I think that we have laid all of that out and it s    at most in the quarters two  quarters three and quarters one of 2020  it might be 2 points  In quarter four  I think it s zero because it was only offset by having a very inefficient schedule  So I think that answers your question Tammy  I don t know if you heard or Tom  any differently than I do Tom Nealon    PresidentNo  I don t disagree that you said  but I do think there    I think if you just start with the fundamentals and the trends that we saw in Q4 just flowing into Q1  and you take    I m not giving guidance on Q2  by the way  The E P begin to look at the early piece of Q2  The trends just continue to look pretty solid  so that fundamentals are good  I think back to the MAX out of our 2019 performance  we still have performed really  really well  not mistaken  there is about point of MAX RASM benefit  so you backed that out  we re still in the 3  range  I think if you look at 2020  I think it will be a lot more modest than that  but we still have strong positive growth  I think what s interesting is what we can t lose sight of    I ll tell you what the problem I d love to have is a huge capacity plan coming  We have a RASM problem to deal with  All right  So we need to grow  All right  But misunderstand  we are still flying a very  very strong schedule  In fact  just the 2020 base schedule    April base schedule has 4 000 daily flights and 4 016 to be precise  and that s in comparison to last year s 4 078 So we still have    and these are little factoids that I want you guys know because we still have a very  very strong schedule and what is also interesting is  and Mike and I and the operation and commercial teams are very  very tightly linked on this whole RTS thing  meaning literally daily are going through this stuff  And what I do know is as Mike and the operations team sort through the reality and the information becomes clearer and clearer  it s really up to them to tell us when the capacity is available  And the reason I say that is  it s not unusual to all for us in normal circumstances as we move between schedules from high utilization or low utilization or vice versa  It s not unusual at all for us to flex up 40  50 aircraft at a time  right So our work in terms of building the MAX back in from a commercial standpoint  I m not saying it s easy  but we know where we put it back in  So it s going to be governed by how fast the aircraft coming back into service and they will just balance  so three things we keep talking about  operational stability  financial results and customer  but I think the base trends are solid  We know how to put the capacity back in  In fact  you can see where we put it back  So it s going to tick it out  All right  So I think    we re ready to go once  once Mike says  OK  here s your grant Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks for that and then thinking ahead optimistically to that maybe someday where you re spooling back up for growth  what spending  if any  and I m talking opex here  not capex  have you deferred as you wait around the basket for Boeing to get its act together  Thanks for taking the questions Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerOn the    and I heard you clearly there  just another opportunity for me to reinforce  We have not deferred    and you all correct me  we haven t deferred any of our capital projects  So we ve got a lot of investment under way in airports around the country  We just opened up a maintenance hangar in Houston  We ve got other hangers that we re working on a lot of technology efforts  So all of that continues  On the opex side  we re not burning the fuel  We sort of stopped the hiring at the fleet plan that we ve shared with you also where we were suspending a lot of our hiring other than attrition  And again  none of that is sub optimized and even with that  again  the results are quite strong  but beyond that  Mike  I can t think of advertising flops around here  We re going to obviously support the reintroduction of the MAX at the appropriate time  So you have things like that  But otherwise  I can t    unless you have something specific that you are probing on  I can t think of anything that you all should expect that will be a large expenditure  except for the marketing and the messaging and those kinds of things  Speech Overlap  Tammy Romo    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd then  there is timing maybe from quarter to quarter in terms of maintenance  but all of that I think we ve got a good handle on it and can manage so  So  no  we feel like the costs are in good shape and other than that  it fits unique to the return to service the MAX storage cost  that sort of thing  but   Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  thank you very much OperatorThe next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen  Please go ahead Helane Becker    Cowen   Co     AnalystAnd Hi  everybody and thank you very much for squeezing me in  I just have two questions  One is Gary  have you talked to your pilots or anybody in the team  talked to the pilots about the potential of what leasing aircraft on an absolutely short term basis to get through this to pick up some of those lost passengers  And my second question is  as you think about shifting from long haul to short haul flying  do you worry about what people will say about climate change and whether or not you re being a good steward of the environment  So thanks very much for the time Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Mike will take them both  You can chime in here  On the first one  Helane  to be honest with you    with our executive team  we have not spent any time exploring the opportunity for wet leasing  So since we haven t talked about it    no  we haven t talked with anybody else in the Company  We re focused on the retirements plan and then  we re always tuned into the use market  I think that makes the most sense  because you just think about the effort involved trying to work with a third party and all the complexities that that would bring  It s not going to be in our configuration  We ve got a unique business model  etc  etc  It s    everything is sort of predicated on agreeing with our assumption that this is a short lived issue and not something that we deal with for year  So as long as it s months  I think we re making the right judgment  So that s a easy answer to your question  You may not agree with it  but it s    but I think we give you an accurate answer And then  on the short versus long  we re a short haul specialist and we ve got more short haul customers than anybody else in the country and arguably more short haul flights  So the only point I m making with that is what we re tweaking here in  19 because of this is not fundamentally changing our long short mix at all  We are still very  very heavily weighted with short haul flights With respect to our concern about that  yeah  I think we re concerned about sustainability  And I was asked on CNBC about that this morning and we are very focused on conservation  on fuel economy  the MAX is front and center in terms of addressing that  It s important to get that airplane back in service because it consumes 15  less gas  We need the air traffic control system modernized and I think the most tangible thing our industry needs to accomplish over the next 10 years is commercially viable alternative fuels  adequate supplies and at reasonable prices  and that would make a very significant impact Carbon offsets are all great  but in my own opinion  there s only so much offsetting that the world can t do and eventually we need to get it consuming less emissions  but if you look at air transportation relative to other alternatives  it compares very  very well  And so  certainly  I don t see any challenge to our short haul business anytime soon  if ever  especially if we continue to improve our carbon footprint as we have been doing Helane Becker    Cowen   Co     AnalystThank you very much for those answers  I appreciate your time OperatorIt appears we have time for one more question  We ll take our last question from David Vernon with Bernstein  Please go ahead David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystHey guys  thanks for taking the time  Gary  I think if we go back before  every call was  sort of  dominated by the MAX  You guys had laid out a vision for implementing some revenue initiatives that you are very excited about  Have you guys had to delay the timeline or introduction of any of those initiatives as you ve been kind of focusing on managing through the fleet deficit or is    and we should expect those to kind of come on as the MAX returns or has there been no change to the timeline on the commercial stuff Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerNo  sir  There has been no change on that  In fact  I don t    I can t recall a change that we ve made because of the MAX with any of    again I m lumping that in as a capital project  Given the fact that there is a financial penalty associated with the MAX and sort of encourages to maybe accelerate  as you know  some of these revenue and other cost initiatives  And Tammy made this point  but one of our cost initiatives is fleet modernization and what that means  at least for 2019  2020 is the acceleration of MAXs into our fleet and the acceleration of retiring some of the older technology and obviously  we re not in a position to take advantage of that cost optimization opportunity right now  There was a question earlier about cost inflation So we ll have a little penalty because of that here in the next year or so and then hopefully  we can get back on track on getting more MAXs in as a percentage of the mix  but except for that  I can t think of anything that has been deferred  Certainly  as a headline  we ve asked our officers to execute their plans and execute them well and was get them deployed and will start driving the value  especially on the revenue side David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystOkay  Thanks for that  And then maybe just as a quick follow up  Tammy  the supplier proceeds number of  400 million  is that associated with the MAX payments or what exactly is that when you think about the cash flow numbers in the earnings release Tammy Romo    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI would really say there is supplier proceeds    as we ve already mentioned  the agreement with Boeing is confidential David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystOkay  So we will draw   Tammy Romo    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd just to be clear  we do consider that effectively an offset of capex  So    and I think we ve made that clear as well Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerIt is a reporting requirement that could be broken out that way  and I think we would admit that with Boeing agreement  it makes the material enough that now it is a line item without describing what suppliers are in that line item David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystAnd as you think about the cash that might be created from this supplier proceeds category  it would just be cash that you d be keeping on hand to fund future requirements or would this be something that you might accelerate into the buyback Tammy Romo    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe will be looking at all of that  I ll just point back to the statement that I made earlier  which is we will continue to take a balanced approach to our capital deployment and I think if you look at what we ve done in the past  we ve used all of those  So again I ll just repeat  We re going to continue investing in the business at least at this point  We have no intentions to slow down our reinvestments back in the business  and I think our track record speaks to are our goal to also take care of our shareholders  That will just continue to take a balanced approach to all of that as always Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I would just state the obvious  which is always better to have more care  Again  there s lots of options Tammy Romo    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe love cash David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystLove cash  Thanks a lot guys Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Ryan Martinez    Managing Director of Investor RelationsOkay  That wraps the analyst portion of the call today  Thank you all for joining us  And as always  feel free to give us a call if you have any follow up questions OperatorThank you  Ladies and gentlemen  we will now begin with our media portion of today s call  I d like to first introduce Ms  Linda Rutherford  Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer Linda Rutherford    Senior Vice President and Chief Communications OfficerThank you  I d like to welcome the members of the media to our call today  We ll go ahead and get started with the Q A portion  So  Chad  if you could just give them instructions on how to queue up  we ll get started OperatorSure  Thank you   Operator Instructions  And our first question will come from Kyle Arnold with Dallas Morning News  Please go ahead Kyle Arnold    The Dallas Morning News    AnalystThanks  Can you talk a little bit about why you want to get that  124 million profit sharing payment out to employees this year and whether as you go forward and negotiate with Boeing and move into 2020  where you re going to look and you kind of similarly for employees Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Kyle  I think it s really  really easy    it s    we knew we were going to sell with Boeing  We also were quite sure that the settlement would not flow through earnings and in terms of the classic definition of profits for profit sharing  And that    so if you just put yourself in employee position here  so if you re here as an employee in 2019 and you may not be here for the next 30 to 40 years when this benefit is realized  then your harm  You will never see the benefit of that  and we actually got a settlement from Boeing  So it was    all of that was anticipated  we shared that early on that we were going to work to settle with Boeing and we have a precedent over decades of making amendments to the contribution to do what s right for our people  and that s either plus or minus for that matter So going back to 9 11 and then the government subsidies that were offered up  we paid profit sharing on that and it did not strictly meet the definition of profits for profit sharing  So long history of doing things like that and it was a great year  it would have easily been a record year  It was actually a record year even though we had these penalties  And I m just delighted that we can do that  So    and so as our Board  they were delighted to do it for people Kyle Arnold    The Dallas Morning News    AnalystAre you going to look for more compensation back for employees  as you continue negotiating with Boeing Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThis is simply a question of how to treat the settlement for profit sharing purposes period  and we will certainly do in 2020  attempt to do in 2020 what we were able to accomplish with Boeing in 2019 Kyle Arnold    The Dallas Morning News    AnalystThanks OperatorAnd the next question will be from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal  Please go ahead Alison Sider    The Wall Street Journal    AnalystHi  good afternoon  I was wondering  you mentioned that there have been a couple    just in the last couple weeks  a few things that are Boeing that have been surprising or unexpected big changes to sort of the assumptions that you d had  and I was wondering if you could say whether  how you think things have changed under the new leadership  what s improved and what hasn t  what you re still looking for Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo I think it s way too early  Boeing has been unstable since March of last year and this is part of the instability  you ve got a new CEO  you ve got a new CEO in the commercial organization  So it s far too early to make an assessment there  Both of these as you and I have talked  we know    all of us know Stan Deal and thank a lot of him and some of us know Dave Calhoun and thanks a lot of them Alison Sider    The Wall Street Journal    AnalystGreat  If I could ask one follow up  I just was curious as you sort of look ahead to return to service  curious if you ve thought at all if there is any consideration of sort of discounting MAX flights  if that s something we re likely to see or if that s not on the table as a possibility Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI ll let Tom speak to that  But I    no  I don t think that we would approach it in the way you described it  But you want to talk about how you re thinking about reintroducing it to service Tom Nealon    PresidentHonestly  we ve done a lot of research in this  right  So Alison  I think that  one of the things that is interesting is we are very  very  very focused on the MAX as you are  What s interesting is the general population is nowhere near zeroed in on this whole topic as we are in the industry  So  we are doing a lot of work  We understand the customer perceptions there  So our customers that we talk to customers  they are non customers  They are    it s interesting  it s really kind of bell curve  I think  I shared this with you at one point  It s kind of a bell curve  And the vast majority of that bell curve is we intend to fly the same as we ve always flown And then you have ends with the bell curve  And actually the two ends  one end skews higher  and that s  we intend to fly more on the 737 MAX  The proof    or the thought being  it s actually been the safest airplane out there to all the scrutiny  And then it s important to say  we re going to fly less  But I think we re going to see the customers come back pretty nicely  some may take a little longer than others  maybe a month or two months  but they re going to come back  And at this point  there is no notion of discounting MAX flights  That s not    that s not in our considerations at this point Alison Sider    The Wall Street Journal    AnalystThank you OperatorAnd the next question comes from Evan Hoopfer with the Dallas Business Journal  Please go ahead Evan Hoopfer    Dallas Business Journal    AnalystGood afternoon  everybody  I just have a quick question for you regarding the potential renaming of the 737 MAX  Gary  I think you said last year that is something that you would not be interested in  I m just wondering  consumer sentiment ever got so negative where the brand became just so toxic that you would consider that or is that kind of a moral line in the sand that you will not cross Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell  To me  it s just a matter of being transparent  notwithstanding Tom s earlier comment  I think the awareness of the MAX issue is very  very high  The importance they attribute to it  I think is where Tom was said  but everybody knows the name the 737 MAX  And so  who is kidding who  to me is just disingenuous  Now  if it s a different airplane and it s a    it s a totally different product and it would be appropriate to rename it  but this is a    you know  ironically  is a very minor change to a piece of software  when you get right down to it And it s Boeing s call  it s not ours and that s what they  that s what they call it  but we ve talked to them  at least the previous management team and they weren t interested in doing that  And we certainly haven t been lobbying them to do it  because I think it s just disingenuous Evan Hoopfer    Dallas Business Journal    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorThe next question comes from Pilar Wolfsteller with FlightGlobal  Please go ahead Pilar Wolfsteller    FlightGlobal    AnalystHi  I ve got two questions about your Hawaii service  Number one  could you sort of talk a little bit about how successful it s been or some of your plans for the future  And the second question is  do you have any comment to the reports that the FAA gave Southwest preferential treatment when it approved those routes Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerTom  I ll let you talk about Hawaii  I ll    since I m talking  I ll answer the second one first  Yeah  we don t know  We don t know what that s about  This is a whistleblower complaint  and we don t know who the whistleblower is  We don t know what the complaint is  So I think what I mostly focused on  I assure that and feel like we got preferential treatment by the way  because we worked really hard to  and they worked as really hard  But I was proud of the work that our team did  We were told going in that this is probably a 12 to 18 month effort  I think in the end  we kind of came in around 14 months  which is about what one would expect It was the government shutdown  was in the middle of that which hampered some of the efforts  What I m most interested in is  what issues are there with our ETOPS  I m not aware of any our folks  I think have done a phenomenal job developing it and then operating it on that point  So I think it s a long way of saying  we don t know what that s about  And then Tom  I ll    would let you talk about Hawaii  please Tom Nealon    PresidentWell  I think  first of all  it s    keep in mind we ve been doing this for 10 months  we ve been flying to Hawaii for 10 months  And it is doing phenomenal  or is everything that we expected is at or better than our expectation  Keep in mind  small piece of our business is right around 2   but it has a very important role that it really supports our California business  so it s exceeding on every dimension  I think the demand and the load factors have been very  very good  We re very satisfied with that  both the long haul as well as the interisland Our ramp up  honestly  has been a little slower than we originally expected because of the MAX and the capacity issue  but everything we put into service  we re thrilled with  At this point  we are  I think this is right  still have to check it  but we ve got  see 14 daily flights from California to Hawaii across four of our big cities Oakland  San Jose  Sacramento and San Diego  We have 38 dailies  interisland  So it s doing fantastic  We re really happy with it What s interesting is  we re actually creating demand that we didn t even see was    is being there  So we re seeing more connecting itineraries within the West Coast  which is interesting because we re creating demand  we re growing the market and fares are lower  And what does that sound like to you  That is the classic Southwest effects  So it s happening again  And I guess the last point I ll be quiet here is  just and I think one of the questions we were asked a lot is    this is a pretty long haul flight  how do you feel like your product is going to perform on a long haul flight  Yeah  by the way  it s not our longest long haul flight  We have transcon that are longer  But having said that  the scores for the customer experience and the brand scores are actually higher than our total system  All right  from the Mainland to Hawaii flight  So net net  we are very  very comfortable and thrilled where we are  I think kind on a long answer Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerTo our flight attendants and the ratio  yes  they do  so  And just speaking real quickly to the ETOPS process  we are involved in that  And it was not a quick    it was very  very thorough  and it was very  very challenging and you look at the quality of what we re doing today  It is phenomenal  So I can t    I can t speak highly enough of the operations team  what they ve accomplished in a short period of time  Actually it wasn t short  took us 14 and 15 months to get it done by the way  which is 12 to 18 is the norm  So that is not a fast path  But Mike  at this point  no one from the FAA has come to you on any issues with ETOPS  had they Michael G  Van de Ven    Chief Operating OfficerNo  no  Like what Gary said  it was a whistleblower complaint  I don t really know a lot about it  I just getting an ETOPS authorization  that is automatic and has a rigorous approach to that  There are advisory circulars at the FAA layout  We take that and you follow it  We did  we did that and over a 14 month period have put the procedures in place  After you start flying you re in a high surveillance period for six months  We had over 3 000 flights since we started service there And the indications are that the procedures that we were authorized to perform    we re performing  we re executing them very well  And they re doing exactly what the FAA and Southwest Airlines expected them to do Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo it s all surprise to us  And again  if there are issues  we want to know what they are and we d be happy to address them  But right now  we don t know what it s about Pilar Wolfsteller    FlightGlobal    AnalystThanks OperatorIt appears that we have time for one last question today  And that question comes from David Slotnick with Business Insider  Please go ahead David Slotnick    Business Insider    AnalystHi  everyone  Thanks for taking the call  I was just wondering  because you were talking about the    I think you said nine full flight simulators by the end of 2020  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your future hiring plan once the MAX is ungrounded really over the next 10 years I know that they  simulators represent a big investment  So sort of wondering how that fits into the whole thing Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYou want to talk about that  Mike Michael G  Van de Ven    Chief Operating OfficerYeah  David  So we have    as we bring airplanes into the fleet  we hire a certain number of pilots and flight attendants for the airplanes that we bring into the fleet  And so that s    there is just a math that we go through and we do that  The other thing that influences our pilot hiring are retirements  And so we ve got probably around 300 to 400  and it grows every year as we age  300 to 400 pilots that go through retirement and then  So we re adding our pilot hiring with  to replace retirements and airplanes to come out of the fleet But  as Gary mentioned  we ve got  if we don t have production airplanes from Boeing this year  we ll only have 45 net new airplanes this year  and we re already staffed up to 61  So we don t need a lot of additional hiring in 2019  And that should start ramping up again in 2020 as a delivery process from Boeing resumes Gary C  Kelly    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerBut we do plan to grow  We plan to grow  and roughly 15 to 20 airplanes a year  And we plan to hire thousands of people every year  So even in recessionary times in our history  we ve been able to grow and not shrink  obviously  we    some years we might grow less  but for the most part  2009 maybe be an exception to that  but yeah  we definitely plan to grow and continue to hire David Slotnick    Business Insider    AnalystGreat  Thank you

199467,420983,LUV,Will Southwest  LUV  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This airline has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7 16  
For the most recent quarter  Southwest was expected to post earnings of  1 09 per share  but it reported  1 23 per share instead  representing a surprise of 12 84   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 35 per share  while it actually produced  1 37 per share  a surprise of 1 48  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Southwest  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Southwest has an Earnings ESP of  3 07  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 23  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-southwest-luv-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200500093,200500093
199468,420984,LUV,Why Earnings Season Could Be Great For Southwest  LUV  ,opinion,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Southwest is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings   with the most up to date information possible   is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for LUV in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at  1 14 per share for LUV  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 11 per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for LUV  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  3 07  heading into earnings season Southwest Airlines Co  Price and EPS Surprise   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that LUV has a Zacks Rank  3 and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Southwest  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report Just Released  Zacks  7 Best Stocks for TodayExperts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over with a stunning average gain of  24 6  per year These 7 were selected because of their superior potential for immediate breakout ,2020-01-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-earnings-season-could-be-great-for-southwest-luv-200500595,200500595

199475,420991,LUV,Earnings Preview  Southwest Airlines  LUV  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 1  
Revenues are expected to be  5 72 billion  up 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 6  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southwest 
For Southwest  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 45  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southwest will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Southwest would post earnings of  1 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 23  delivering a surprise of  12 84  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Southwest doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-southwest-airlines-luv-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200499357,200499357
199484,421000,LUV,Is Southwest Airlines  LUV  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Southwest Airlines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 11  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 76  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Southwest Airlines  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Transportation sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Southwest Airlines has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 23  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Southwest Airlines has a P S ratio of about 1 29  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 42 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  LUV is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of overvalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Southwest Airlines currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Southwest Airlines a solid choice for value investors   What About the Stock Overall  Though Southwest Airlines might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of B  This gives LUV a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current year has seen two estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to nine higher  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen nine downward revision compared to no upward in the same time period This has had a notable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has improved by 3 7  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has decreased by 2 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Southwest Airlines Co  Price and Consensus
 
   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Southwest Airlines is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 29  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence   However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Transportation   Airline has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through Q3 2019  while the S P 500 gained  39 6   five of our strategies returned  51 8    57 5    96 9    119 0   and even  158 9  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   Q3 2019  while the S P averaged  5 6  per year  our top strategies averaged up to  54 1  per year ",2019-12-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-southwest-airlines-luv-a-great-pick-for-value-investors-200492868,200492868

We ve written about identifying stock  before  and a lot of the analysis you do to ensure your attractively valued investment idea won t just languish or drop further is interpretive  There s no magic bullet to ensuring a stock will rise in value  but there are some quantitative analyses you should do to help avoid investing in a value trap 
Why would you want to do this  Well  qualitative analysis takes a lot of time  If you can rule a stock out as a value trap through a quantitative process  you can reduce the number of stocks you really need to dive into 
First  a quick reminder of the typical qualitative things you should look at 
Qualitative Stock Value Trap Analysis
Think about things like 
The Industry
Industry growth  rising tide that raises all boats  or the opposite  Cyclicality  at the peak and still struggling  Concentration  lots of players competing away profits  Barriers to entry and exit  will concentration get better or worse  Product differentiability  are the company s current products differentiated or can they be  or is this a commoditized space  Position in the industry chain  any buyer or supplier power  Any unions or governments or other stakeholders with interests  The CompanyCompetitive advantages economic moats pricing powerManagement quality   compensationStated strategy and demonstrated ability to executeUpcoming catalystsBloomberg has a pretty good list  too 
A lot of this comes from reading filings  earnings transcripts  etc   and really thinking about what it all means 
But there are some things you can analyze quantitatively  which Old School Value can help with 
Quantitative Stock Value Trap Analysis
Cost Structures
The structure of a company s costs can make a big difference in how it behaves and how it performs  We ve used Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  as an example  below 
If your target company s cost structure is noticeably different from the leaders in its industry  this is worth thinking about 
In the OSV Compare Competitors tab  it s very easy to look at Gross Margin  Operating Margin  and Net Margin across competitors  Does your target stand out  or does the industry leader 
As revenue has increased or decreased  what s happened to the margins 




A high fixed cost producer will see margins deteriorate quickly as revenues decline and could send it into a spiral  But  they will also see margins rebound just as rapidly if revenues turn around  which could be a catalyst 
A company with higher variable costs will be able to maintain its margins on the way up and down  which can reduce failure risk 
Quality
One of the biggest reasons a company may be a value trap is that it s going to go out of business  or at least experience serious difficulties 

Dig into all of our Quality Checks these to make sure accounting is all good and the risk of insolvency is low  Look at everything from     and     as well as the standard  
You can see all the  
Insiders
Check out insider ownership and transactions 
On the Key Stats page  click Stats to get the insider ownership percentage  and click Insiders to get the transactions from the last 6 months 
If insider ownership is too high or too low  I d consider it an issue  Too low  and there s not enough management commitment  Too high  and outside institutional investors won t have any influence in turning things around 
And  if insiders are selling stock as it s going down  that s worrisome  They wouldn t be selling if they believed the company was undervalued and on the cusp of a renaissance 
Shorts
On the Stats page  I d also look at the  Float Short  percentage  If there are a lot of shorts  I d probably go look for why people are betting against this company and see if I agree 
I generally like to make my investment decisions without reading a lot of opinions from other people  at least until I ve formed my own opinion and have moved to the  why am I wrong   stage   but this is one place where I ll make an exception  The  short cases  I ve read in the past are often quite well researched  Perhaps that comes from the possibility of infinite losses 
Conclusion
Although there s no substitute for evaluating a company and its industry from a qualitative perspective to determine for yourself if the prevailing narrative is reasonable  you can also look at the above more quantitative areas to see if it s worth spending more time doing that additional analysis 
Like with a quantitative stock screener  doing a quantitative pass first on a stock that might be a value trap can save a lot of time ",2019-11-13,Jae Jun,https://www.investing.com/analysis/quantitative-stock-value-trap-analysis-200484827,200484827

What s Next for Southwest 
While Southwest has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Southwest was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

199556,421072,LUV,Southwest Airlines  LUV  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 35 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 1  
Revenues are expected to be  5 95 billion  up 3 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 27  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southwest 
For Southwest  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 34  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southwest will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Southwest would post earnings of  0 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 70  delivering a surprise of  14 75  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Southwest doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/southwest-airlines-luv-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200441376,200441376
199582,421098,LUV,Why Is Southwest  LUV  Down 4 1  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   Shares have lost about 4 1  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Southwest due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  
Earnings Beat at Southwest Airlines in Q1Southwest Airlines delivered first quarter 2019 earnings per share of 70 cents  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents  However  the bottom line declined year over year  Results were affected to the tune of approximately  150 million due to flight cancellations  effects of the government shutdown and softness in bookings Operating revenues of  5 149 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 140 9 million  The top line also rose 4 1  year over year  Passenger revenues accounting for bulk  92 2   of the top line improved 3 5  year over year Operating StatisticsAirline traffic  measured in revenue passenger miles  inched up 0 9  year over year to 30 7 billion in the quarter under review  Capacity or available seat miles  ASMs  expanded 1 4  to 37 89 billion  Load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers  came in at 81   down 50 basis points on a year over year basis as capacity expansion exceeded traffic growth Passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenues  inched up 2  to 12 52 cents  Moreover  in the reported quarter  revenue per available seat mile  RASM  rose 2 7  year over year to 13 59 cents Operating Expenses   IncomeIn the first quarter  operating income  excluding special items  totaled  505 million compared with  584 million in the year earlier period  Total adjusted operating expenses  excluding profit sharing  fuel and oil expense plus special items  climbed 9 5  year over year  The increase in costs was due to delay in launching the Hawaii service  flight cancellations and other factors Fuel price per gallon  inclusive of fuel tax  economic  was down 1 9  year over year to  2 05  Consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile  CASM  excluding fuel  oil and special items increased 7 4  year over year to 9 58 cents LiquidityThe company had cash and cash equivalents of  2 344 million at the end of the first quarter compared with  1 854 million at the end of 2018  As of Mar 31  2019  the company had a long term debt  less current maturities  of  2 602 million compared with  2 771 million at 2018 end While the carrier generated a free cash flow of  945 million during the first quarter  it returned  678 million to its shareholders through  178 million in dividends and  500 million via share repurchases Q2   2019 OutlookThe company anticipates RASM  revenue per available seat mile  to rise 5 5 7 5  year over year in the second quarter of 2019  The RASM guidance takes into account benefits from the revenue management enhancements implemented last year and several other positives  The shift in the timing of Easter will also benefit second quarter RASM Economic fuel costs are estimated between  2 10 and  2 20 per gallon in the second quarter compared with  2 21 in the prior year period  Additionally  second quarter CASM  excluding fuel and oil expense plus profit sharing expense  is expected to expand in the 10 5 12 5  range year over year  This increase in expenses is due to underutilized fleet as a result of delay in initiating the Hawaii service and the MAX 8 groundings  which caused numerous flight cancellations among other factors  The metric is anticipated to ascend 5 5 6 5  for the full year as well  This downside is primarily attributable to labor related costs and lower capacity on account of the MAX groundings  
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates  The consensus estimate has shifted  6 99  due to these changes

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in

While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 61 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 7  
Revenues are expected to be  5 14 billion  up 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8 76  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southwest 
For Southwest  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southwest will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Southwest would post earnings of  1 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 17  delivering a surprise of  10 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Southwest doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-southwest-airlines-luv-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200408293,200408293
199616,421132,LUV,Hawaiian Holdings Stock Slips To 52 Week Low  Here s Why,opinion,"Shares of Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA     the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines   slipped to a 52 week low of  24 46 during the trading session on Mar 22  before retracing a bit to close at  29 49  In the past three months  the stock has lost 6 1  against its  s 2 9  growth 
Three Month Price Performance

 
Reasons Behind Downturn
In the final quarter of 2018  Hawaiian Holdings struggled on the unit revenue front as the metric declined 3 3  on a year over year basis   What is worse is that the situation is unlikely to get any better in the first quarter of 2019  Unit revenues are expected to decline between 3  and 6  in the January March period  Weakness pertaining to inter island travel demand is hurting this key metric 
Additionally  the possibility of the company losing market share in its primary market   Hawaii   due to increased competition following Southwest Airlines    NYSE LUV   entry on Mar 17  2019  has hurt the stock 
Capacity related woes are added concern for the company  Moreover  load factor    of seats filled by passengers  declined 50 basis points to 85 3  in 2018  This was because capacity expansion outweighed traffic growth in the year 
Load factor has declined due to capacity overexpansion in the first two months of 2019 as well   Capacity is projected to grow between 1 5  and 3  for first quarter 2019  The metric is expected to increase in the band of 1 5 4 5  for 2019 
Downward Estimate Revisions
Due to the above mentioned headwinds  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s current quarter earnings has moved 26 7  south over the past 60 days  Also  the reading for the current year has been revised 12 1  downward over the same time frame 
The company s unimpressive  of C is a further negative

199617,421133,LUV,Airline Industry Near Term Outlook Robust On Passenger Revenues,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of companies engaged in the transport of passengers and cargo to various destinations globally  Most operators maintain a fleet comprising multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes  They operate with the help of their regional airline subsidiaries and third party regional carriers  The industry participants utilize their respective cargo divisions for providing a wide range of freight and mail services The space includes legacy carriers like American Airlines  AAL   low cost players like Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   LUV  and regional operators like SkyWest  SKYW   Within the low cost segment  there are ultra low cost carriers like Spirit Airlines  SAVE  Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The airline industry is benefiting from strong demand for air travel  Affordable air fares along with a much improved job market and rising disposable income have provided consumers an added incentive to opt for air travel  The International Air Transport Association   IATA   expects 4 59 billion passengers to take to the skies in 2019  reflecting a year over year increase of 5 8   Average net profit per departing passenger is expected to go up to  7 75 from  7 45 in 2018  Furthermore  net profit in the aviation space is expected to go up to  35 5 billion in 2019 from  32 3 billion estimated for 2018  The current tax law  which came into effect in late 2017  is a huge positive for the airline industry  A considerably lower corporate tax rate has boosted cash flow and improved the bottom line of carriers  Huge savings owing to the reduction in corporate tax rate has enabled companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases  among others  Shareholder friendly activities apart  lower tax related outflow of most carriers have enabled them to undertake employee friendly activities such as profit sharing  Carriers like SkyWest and Alaska Air  ALK  have already increased their dividend payouts  More dividend hikes are expected during the course of the year  With oil prices declining in excess of 20  from the highs of  76 a barrel touched in October 2018 levels  operating expenses of airlines have decreased  As fuel is a major component of operating expenses for carriers  the reduction supports bottom line growth  In fact  in December 2018  the IATA predicted that average fuel cost in 2019 will be around  65 per barrel  Brent crude price  compared with average fuel cost of  73 per barrel in 2018  Average cost of jet fuel price is predicted to be  81 3 per barrel in 2019 compared with  87 6 per barrel in 2018  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Sunny OutlookThe Zacks Airline industry is a 27 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  28  which places it in the top 11  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since the end of October 2018  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has increased more than 11  Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Lags Sector   S P 500The Zacks Airline industry has lagged the broader Zacks Transportation Sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The industry has declined 21 5  over this period compared with the broader sector s decrease of 4 8   The S P 500 has increased 7 5  in the said time frame One Year Price Performance  Industry s Current Valuation On the basis of trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA   which is a commonly used multiple for valuing airline stocks  the industry is currently trading at 6X compared with the S P 500 s 10 84X  It is also below the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 7 66X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 15 78X  as low as 4 31X and at the median of 6X Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio  Bottom LineThe near term prospects of the airline industry appear to be encouraging due to the uptick in passenger revenues on the back of strong demand for air travel  In fact  air travel demand is likely to remain strong in the long term as well  IATA expects 8 2 billion passengers to take the sky route by 2037  The forecast indicates a 3 5  compound annual growth rate  CAGR  Decline in oil prices and low tax rates also bode well for the sector participants  However  with labor deals in vogue in the airline space labor costs are expected to limit bottom line growth going forward  Capacity related woes are also a challenge for

199679,421195,LUV,Bull Of The Day  Spirit Airlines  SAVE ,opinion,"Spirit Airlines  Inc   SAVE  upped its fourth quarter guidance in November on the back of higher non ticket revenues and increased load factor expectations  Plus  airlines got a boost recently after solid earnings reports from American Airlines  AAL  and other industry giants  Looking ahead  Spirit s top and bottom line estimates are impressive as well  So  let s see why SAVE is Monday s Bull of the Day 
Overview 
Spirit in November upped its Q4 total revenue per available seat mile guidance from a 6  jump to 11  growth  The guidance increase was driven by higher non ticket revenue  including new dynamic pricing for seats and bags  among other factors  On top of the raised TRASM  which is a vital measurement for airlines  the firm cut its outlook for economic fuel costs and non fuel unit costs 
The low cost airline company is also coming off a strong third quarter that saw it beat earnings and revenue estimates  despite some overall industry headwinds  Meanwhile  American Airlines  JetBlue Airways  JBLU   and Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   LUV  all surged on the back of strong quarterly earnings reports last Thursday  Investors should also note that the airline companies said they could increase their revenues in the first quarter despite the government shutdown  Airlines  however  did warn that the continuation of the shutdown could spell some trouble down the road 
SAVE stock hovered at around  57 10 a share on Friday  This marked a roughly 12 5  downturn from its 52 week high of  65 35 per share and could set up a solid buying opportunity for those high on Spirit 
Q4   Fiscal 2019 Outlook 
Spirit released in the middle of January some preliminary Q4 guidance  The firm s TRASM popped 11 4   which topped its updated November estimate that called for 11  expansion  with the gains driven by  modestly stronger peak yields   Spirit s available seat miles in the quarter also surged 16 2  year over year to come in above its previous 15  guidance 
On top of that  Spirit reported a record quarterly completion factor of 99 6   With that said  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for SAVE s fourth quarter revenues to soar 27 8  to reach  852 24 million  This would crush the year ago period s 15 3  revenue expansion  but mark a slight slowdown compared to Q3 s 31 6  top line surge 
Looking a bit further ahead  Spirit s fiscal Q1 revenues are projected to jump nearly 20  and its full year 2019 revenues are expected to climb over 16  above our current year estimate to reach  3 85 billion 
Moving onto the bottom end of the income statement  the firm s adjusted Q4 earnings are projected to skyrocket 90 4  to touch  1 39 a share  Investors should note that this would blow away last quarter s 56  bottom line expansion  Meanwhile  Spirit s full year 2018 earnings are projected to climb 31 8   Plus  the company s fiscal 2019 earnings are expected to soar 49 4  higher than our 2018 projection 
Earnings Trends 
Maybe more important than Spirit s stellar quarterly and longer term earnings outlook is the firm s recent string of positive earnings estimate revisions  We can see that within the last 30 days  at least some analyst have grown more bullish on SAVE s earnings  Spirit s positive bottom line revision activity is a good sign because earnings growth is one of the best long term indicators of positive stock price movement 
Bottom Line
Spirit is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock at the moment  based largely on its impressive earnings estimate revision activity over the last month  SAVE also sports  A  grades for both Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system to help it earn an overall  A  VGM score 
Spirit certainly looks like a stock to consider for investors interested in the airline industry because of its revenue growth outlook and double digit earnings expansion projections  The company is scheduled to host its fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 earnings call on Wednesday  February 6

199687,421203,LUV,In a Month You ll Wish the Shutdown Were Only as Bad as Today,news," Bloomberg     Airport security screeners could quit en masse  grounding flights  The federal courts could stop hearing civil cases  City buses could stop running 
And 38 million Americans could stop getting food stamps 
Officials from Washington to Wall Street are pondering nightmare scenarios if the partial U S  government shutdown that is already the longest on record extends into spring    or beyond 
 Shutdowns don t get bad linearly  they get bad exponentially   said Sam Berger  a senior adviser at the Center for American Progress  who worked at the Office of Management and Budget under President Barack Obama 
President Donald Trump s administration has found creative means to blunt some of the shutdown s effects    figuring out ways to process tax refunds  for example  Yet agencies that have been able to dip into user fees  leftover funds and other revenue streams are running out of those reserves 
Lawsuits are already testing the administration s ability to keep on the job unpaid workers  hundreds of thousands of whom missed their first paycheck last week 
Efforts by Republicans such as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to cut an immigration deal to resolve the impasse have failed  and Trump on Monday rejected his latest proposal  An administration official said the White House is game planning for the shutdown to continue through at least the end of February 
Beyond its direct effects on businesses  economists say the shutdown threatens to shake consumer confidence and chip away at retail sales  particularly as unpaid federal workers and contractors forgo spending on cars  new homes and even entertainment 
To be sure  three quarters of the government was funded by appropriations enacted before the standoff began  Departments such as Defense  Labor and Health and Human Services remain in business  Still others  like the U S  Postal Service and U S  Federal Reserve  have funding streams separate from what Congress provides 
But the shuttering of more than a dozen departments and agencies    from Homeland Security to the Environmental Protection Agency    is being felt across the country  threatening the economy  public safety  businesses and people s wallets 
And it s only going to get worse 
Safety Net
The U S  Department of Agriculture said there may not be enough money to keep food stamp benefits flowing to 38 million recipients past February 
That spending accounts for about 10 percent of the food U S  families buy for their homes  with purchases spread across some 260 000 retailers  according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities 
Joe Brusuelas  chief economist with financial consultant RSM US LLP  estimates the loss of food stamp funding alone would strip at least 0 53 percent from the GDP 
Other portions of the safety net are also at risk  The Department of Housing and Urban Development has said it can t renew 1 150 rental assistance contracts with private landlords that expired in December or will expire in January  accounting for some 40 000 low income households 
Another 550 rental assistance contracts expire in February  affecting an additional 16 000 households  And if the shutdown stretches into March  subsidies for the great majority of contracts will end  along with all subsidy payments for the largest rental assistance program  jeopardizing the vouchers used by 2 2 million low income households  said Sharon Parrott  a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities 
Landlords nationwide may then face an increasingly dire choice  possibly forcing tenants to pay full monthly rent or evicting them 
Work Without Pay
An extended shutdown will also test the limits of how long government employees and contractors will keep working without pay    an issue for those designated as  essential  and told to remain on the job even though paychecks have been suspended  While most workers have complied so far  an extended shutdown  combined with employers eager to hire in the tight labor market  could challenge both their loyalty and savings 
Transportation Security Administration security officers are already calling in sick at twice the usual rate  forcing airports in Miami  Houston and Virginia to consolidate security lanes  Hydrick Thomas  TSA council president for the American Federation of Government Employees  said in a statement that if the government continues to ask employees to work without pay   we re risking losing them  
If TSA officers leave in large numbers  the government would struggle to replace them during a shutdown  potentially crippling air travel and exposing passengers to greater risk 
That danger goes beyond the TSA  Federal workers considered essential include correctional officers at federal prisons  air traffic controllers and the firefighters who battled some of California s wildfires last year  Even furloughed workers who aren t considered essential could begin drifting away  creating openings that will have to be filled when the government reopens 
 Now is the time when people are going to start looking for other options   said Steve Lenkart  executive director of the 110 000 member National Federation of Federal Employees   The rent is due  and a lot of these feds live paycheck to paycheck  
Federal Leases
The federal government may stop paying its own rent because there is no one to process the checks 
The drop in revenue would hit property owners as soon as the end of this month  when the General Services Administration would usually send out its January payments  according to Darian LeBlanc  director of the government services group at Cushman   Wakefield PLC 
The GSA leased more than 190 million square feet in nearly 7 000 buildings nationwide at the start of its 2018 fiscal year  representing roughly  5 6 billion in annual rent payments  according to an agency report  That means landlords could be out some  460 million a month if the agency stops issuing checks 
And even if the GSA were to designate the staff who process those rent checks as essential  making them work without pay  there s another risk  The Federal Buildings Fund  which is the source of the GSA s rent payments  could go broke  as other closed down federal agencies stop paying the GSA for using its buildings 
 It is just a function of time before that happens   LeBlanc said in a phone interview 
Can t Evict
If the government stops paying its rent  landlords have no good options  The law prevents them from evicting federal tenants  their only recourse is to sue  In the meantime  landlords must continue to honor their commitments under the lease  such as servicing the property 
 It becomes a very  very bad situation for these lessors   LeBlanc said   They ve got debt payments and all the things that they have to meet  It could become very problematic  
Douglas Development Corp  which rents almost 1 million square feet of space to the GSA  has set aside money in case the government stops paying  according to Norman Jemal  a principal and senior vice president 
 We re in a position to sustain it for multiple months  but not in perpetuity   Jemal said in a phone interview   There would be a lot of very substantial ripple effects to many owners throughout the country that would be affected by the lack of payment  
A GSA spokeswoman  Amanda Osborn  referred questions about rental payments to the agency s shutdown web page  which says the agency  is aware of concerns from the Lessor community regarding GSA s ability to make timely rent payments   and  is diligently exploring all available options  
City Buses
In Tennessee  the Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority may have to reduce bus service if the shutdown lasts long enough  said Lisa Maragnano  the agency s executive director 
Federal funding accounted for about 16 percent of the agency s roughly  22 million annual budget in its 2017 fiscal year  she said  The City of Chattanooga is willing to advance funding for transit budgeted through June 30  roughly  450 000 per month  but that won t fully cover the shortfall in federal financing 
 It will get us through February maybe  maybe some of March   she said   But again  it s just the unknown  I can t sit here and tell you definitively that that will cover everything that we need because I don t know how long this is going to go on for  
The problem for cities like Chattanooga stems from the shuttering of the Federal Transit Administration  which helps finance both major projects and some operating expenses  especially at smaller agencies  The FTA workers responsible for releasing funds aren t on the job and public transportation advocates say systems nationwide are already in the early stages of a cash crunch 
 It s not just the federal employees that will be affected now   Maragnano said   It s going to be all their constituents and folks who rely on transit to get to work and to their medical appointments  
Court Cases
Another worry is the federal court system  The Administrative Office of the U S  Courts announced that its goal is  sustaining paid operations through Jan  18    At that point  the courts will run on an  essential work   basis 
Individual courts would be responsible for deciding what that means 
Some have already suspended civil cases involving the federal government  in part because so many government lawyers have been furloughed 
The Food and Drug Administration says high risk food surveillance    of products like seafood  soft cheeses and unpasteurized juice    will restart Tuesday but some routine food safety inspections are already suspended 
The work is  being done by an inspectorate that s largely going unpaid   during the government shutdown  FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said via Twitter 
 We re entering uncharted territory   said Mike Gruber  vice president of government affairs for the Grocery Manufacturers Association 
Breweries have been unable to roll out new craft beers because applications are piling up at a Treasury Department agency responsible for approving labels before the products can be sold  The stall hits an industry with at least 7 000 breweries across the U S     and the consequences threaten to ripple to the suppliers of their hops  barley and other ingredients 
FDA Reviews
Because it can t collect fees that pay for pharmaceutical reviews  the FDA isn t accepting new applications for medicines  And it s weeks away from running out of funds it uses to review new medical products 
The effects of the shutdown are now extending to drugmakers that submitted filings for review before the beginning of the impasse  Aimmune Therapeutics Inc  announced in a filing that the FDA will not begin to review the application for its peanut allergy pill  AR101  The Brisbane  California based company submitted an application for the medicine on Dec  21 
The U S  Patent and Trademark Office  which is funded exclusively through user fees  has continued to operate under previous year funds  and agency spokesman Paul Fucito had no comment on when that money might run out 
If the agency is forced to shut down  it would delay the examination of tens of thousands of patent applications  as well as reviews of issued patents that can affect the outcome of district court cases and royalty disputes between companies 
IPOs Halted
Wall Street has already felt the impact in market gyrations  but a long term shutdown promises to trigger a cascading effect through businesses and the economy 
Among the risks  No new initial public offerings on U S  public exchanges 
Until the Securities and Exchanges Commission reopens  companies that want to file their listing plans    including huge private companies like Uber Technologies Inc  and Lyft Inc    aren t getting any feedback from the agency to help them move forward with the process 
That gets critical on Feb  14  when financial statements provided by companies waiting to launch their IPOs go stale and must be updated    and audited    for the whole of 2018 
 The window to price by Feb  14 is closing   said David Goldschmidt  global head of capital markets at law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher   Flom LLP   If people aren t able to do their deals by then there s a chance we could lose a good part of the first quarter for IPOs  
Uber and Lyft  both of which had been targeting their IPOs for the first half of the year  believe the shutdown could slow the timeline of their listings  people familiar with the matter said last week 
Mobile networking company Pareteum Corp  warned that its acquisition of Wi Fi network provider iPass Inc  won t be done by Jan  31   as a result of the government shutdown     a key deadline for iPass to avoid being delisted from Nasdaq 
 IPass is in the process of requesting an extension from Nasdaq to the extraordinary circumstances resulting from the government shutdown   Pareteum said in a Jan  11 filing  but if iPass doesn t get the extension  the trading of its common stock will be suspended and the delisting process will begin anew 
Truck Delays
Some companies may not be able to introduce new products or complete mergers that requires government approval  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  for example  is awaiting EPA emissions certification to sell new heavy duty Ram pickups 
 I am concerned  very concerned  because if it continues  it will have an impact on on the launch   Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley told reporters this week at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit 
Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  Co  had expected to begin selling tickets for flights to Hawaii in late 2018 and to start service this quarter  But it can t move forward without approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for extended flights over water 
Likewise  T Mobile US Inc  s  26 5 billion proposed purchase of fellow mobile carrier Sprint Corp  can t go forward without a sign off from the Federal Communications Commission  which is mostly shut  And FCC employees charged with approving new technologies and devices    including equipment needed for the 5G wireless upgrade    are furloughed

199689,421205,LUV,Southwest Airlines  LUV  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  36 4  
Revenues are expected to be  5 68 billion  up 7 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 92  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southwest 
For Southwest  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 40  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Southwest will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Southwest would post earnings of  1 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of  1 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Southwest appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/southwest-airlines-luv-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200376689,200376689
199690,421206,LUV,Southwest Airlines  LUV  Surpasses Q4 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 17 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 06 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 77 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10 38   A quarter ago  it was expected that this airline would post earnings of  1 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of 1 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Southwest  which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry  posted revenues of  5 70 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 48   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 27 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Southwest shares have added about 9 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 3  
What s Next for Southwest 
While Southwest has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Southwest was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 79 on  5 32 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 82 on  23 61 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

199692,421208,LUV,Most S P Sectors Rise  Led by Tech   Crude to Extend Rally Today,news,"Market is perhaps a bit tenuous ahead of the president s address tomorrow  It pressed higher on FAANGs  Crude  Intraweek traders have not had a pullback to enter as of yet  writes Gene Inger Monday  And  some CES tech previews  He s presenting at MoneyShow Orlando 
 You don t go from Wild Turkey to Cold Turkey  very quickly  That s an old quote of Herb Kelleher  founder of Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   who passed away last week  Former Dallas Fed head Dick Fisher mentioned that quote Friday 
He was reflecting on Fed monetary policy and former Dallas Fed President Kelleher  the Southwest chairman was also at that post during the epic debacle we had projected in 2007  08   And he was also a fan of Wild Turkey Kentucky Bourbon   I thought he preferred Maker s Mark   but maybe not   
Reuters  Wall Street  SPX  extends rally Monday to second day  10 of 11 sectors rise on trade optimism 






Of course  Dick Fisher was sharing the metaphor as it relates to weening off a form of addiction  as he lamented Mr  Kelleher s explanation years ago as to why Chairman Bernanke s Fed  on which Fisher served  failed to lighten up on super easy emergency monetary stimulus after the crisis ebbed 
To me this comment  and earlier Friday Jim Grant  who is a bond guy  about the commercialization of ultra low cost money  confirm my assertion that no problem exists with regard to how Jerome Powell chairs the Fed  Rather the issue was how Bernanke overstayed the emergency low rates and QE 
Earlier Friday  I suspected Powell would talk nice but not at all change actual policy thinking at Friday s panel discussion  So  I found the opinion Dick Fisher shared to be very important  It was that other than one or two palliative words  he saw no change or movement at all in Fed monetary policy 






So  we have Dick Fisher and Jim Grant in the bond arena so again it meant something to me  as I was drawing common sense outlooks as regard rolling off the tremendous amount of Fed balance sheet paper of course now  And presumably expanding this year if they can t roll it off 
Now you have these gentlemen saying I ve got this right about the heart of issues surrounding rates  That being that it s a supply issue primarily and not very much related to anything inflationary or to domestic economic strength 






And  of course the Jobs number ignited the Friday response initially  with far stronger than consensus numbers  Although that doesn t automatically mean the economy s cooking again  and that data was a bit stale from Dec  12   Of course  we re pleased to see more people working or even emerging from the shadows of the disengaged workforce that s out there 






Now previously the market tried to link Fed Quantitative Tightening to some misjudgment about that economic vibrancy  So  there we concurred that Powell could have had a different tone  it was just off the cuff  at the FOMC news conference  He clarified that in talks  and again Friday  That s context they are all debating 
There was not a single word that suggests divergence from the Fed s approach  and needs given supply concerns  or the market continuing to relate this more to short term rates or the economy  the chair sort of has to do that because of his mandate which isn t as global as what s become the modern Treasury market  which he has to take into account  






In sum  now we await the new trade talks with China  And presuming the outcome is fine tuned enough to revive growth expectations  there and here by the way  you could extend this overall move 
Reuters  US  China can reach trade deal  we can live with   says Commerce secretary Monday 
It s not a flawless technical pattern  given the denial of a full secondary test of the prior low due to Jobs news and overly euphoric interpretation of Chairman Powell s remarks 
Wild Turkey to Cold Turkey reflects simply not being hawkish or dovish but rather knowing what has to be done  having a gradual withdrawal from inebriation  That was my 2015 16 taking the punch bowl away viewpoint of a market that was struggling then  as Wall Street seemed so distraught free money was basically going away

When looking at the last two reports  this airline has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 1 34   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Southwest came out with earnings of  1 08 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 06 per share  representing a surprise of 1 89   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 25 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 26 per share  delivering a surprise of 0 80  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Southwest lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Southwest has an Earnings ESP of  1 91  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 24  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

199712,421228,LUV,Airlines warned against complacency after dream safety run,news,"By Jamie Freed and Victoria Bryan SYDNEY  Reuters    Global airlines  coming off a record low accident rate in 2017  need to guard against complacency over safety as heavy growth in travel demand stretches the air transport system  industry leaders warned at a conference this week  There were no jet crashes in 2017 and 19 fatalities across the sector  while some 301 passengers have died in five crashes over just the first five months of 2018  including the first fatality on a U S  airline since 2009  The other fatal accidents occurred in Cuba  Russia  Iran and Nepal  Air transportation advocates say it is still by far the safest form of travel  But the industry also needs to modernize a fragmented infrastructure and adopt new technology to keep it safe even as demand balloons  delegates at annual talks of the International Air Transport Association  IATA  said  Alexandre de Juniac  director general of the group of 280 airlines  called for a continued rigid focus on safety   No arrogance in any case   we need  humility and work   he said after IATA s three day meeting in Sydney  With IATA forecasting passenger traffic will nearly double by 2036  there are worries over whether the industry will be able to attract and train enough capable pilots and engineers  Rising congestion in airspace and at airports  some of which are operating above capacity  and poor air traffic control are already posing challenges  A deadly plane crash in Nepal in March is a case in point  Airline and airport authorities in Kathmandu have blamed each other after the US Bangla Airlines crash that killed 49 in what is the Himalayan nation s worst air disaster since 1992  The cause of the crash is still under investigation  but a transcript of pilot radio conversations with the ground revealed confusion over the designated runway  Aviation remains a  very  very safe industry  despite the accidents this year  but there is concern over whether systems can keep pace with future growth  said Peter Harbison  executive chairman of Sydney based CAPA Centre for Aviation   There are worries about having lesser trained pilots and that creating more risk  or congested airspace  air traffic control that is not adequate to support the services going through   he said   To view a graphic on Aviation safety  click   NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR SAFER SKIES IATA executives said new air traffic technology is one of the keys to keeping busy skies safe   Implementing technology is expensive and difficult but it is available now   IATA s senior vice president of safety and flight operations  Gilberto Lopez Meyer  said on the sidelines of the industry s biggest annual gathering   It is allowing us to reduce separation safely   he said  referring to the ability for jets to fly closer together in a crowded airspace  IATA called for airlines to share more safety data and use predictive analytics to prevent accidents   We are always on edge  always looking to see what we can learn  what we can improve   said Alan Joyce  outgoing chairman of the IATA and also the CEO of Qantas Airways Ltd  AX QAN   which has not had a hull loss since the dawn of the jet age   Although accidents are rare in air travel  with the numbers dropping over the past 15 years  they can lead to significant financial and reputational consequences

199715,421231,LUV,Southwest Airlines Co  Earnings  Moving In The Right Direction Again,opinion,"The low cost carrier has stumbled this year due to a fatal accident that occurred in April  but unit revenue trends are already starting to improve 
The second quarter of 2018 was challenging for Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  on many levels  Most importantly  it had to cope with the first accident related fatality of a Southwest Airlines customer in the company s history  In addition to being a terrible tragedy  this mid April incident also hurt Southwest s revenue performance last quarter 
Nevertheless  the popular low cost carrier posted solid earnings results on Thursday morning  especially by airline industry standards  Furthermore  its outlook for the rest of 2018 suggests that Southwest Airlines is quickly getting back on track for long term earnings growth 
Southwest Airlines results  The raw numbers

What happened with Southwest Airlines this quarter 
The biggest event to affect Southwest Airlines during the second quarter was the April 17 engine malfunction on Flight 1380  Not surprisingly  the carrier experienced a slowdown in bookings following the incident  This was exacerbated by a decision to  turn off  all of the company s marketing activity temporarily  Southwest Airlines ads generally have a lighthearted tone  and management wisely recognized that this would be inappropriate in the days following a passenger fatality 
Southwest Airlines estimates that the effects of the fatality reduced passenger revenue by about  100 million last quarter  That equates to more than half of the company s 3  decline in revenue per available seat mile  RASM   This RASM result was at the low end of Southwest s original forecast range  but right in line with its updated guidance published last month 
On the bright side  Southwest Airlines  nonfuel unit costs dropped 0 8  excluding special items  If profit sharing is also excluded  adjusted nonfuel unit costs rose 0 4   This was better than the company s guidance for a 1  to 2  increase 
Finally  Southwest Airlines decided to take advantage of its slumping stock price by returning more cash to shareholders over the next year or two  In May  the board raised Southwest s dividend by 28  and announced a new  2 billion share repurchase program 
What management had to say
While Southwest Airlines  operating margin fell by nearly 4 percentage points last quarter  management struck a confident tone about the future  According to CEO Gary Kelly 

We expect the revenue impact from  the fatal accident  to be temporary and subside in third quarter 2018 and are encouraged by the solid rebound in demand  Separately  we deployed additional revenue management tools and techniques during second quarter 2018  and we continue to expect to generate incremental improvements in pre tax results of  200 million this year from the investment in our new reservation system  Our second half 2018 flight schedule is better optimized  and our Rapid Rewards Program and other ancillary products continue to perform very well 

Kelly also noted that nonfuel unit costs will start to move upward again    albeit very modestly    in the second half of 2018  However  he emphasized Southwest s commitment to avoiding long term cost creep  stating   We expect higher unit costs as we move into second half 2018  due largely to shifting spending from first half 2018  With the completion of major revenue initiatives over the last several years  we will refocus our efforts to control costs and drive efficiency  especially in light of higher fuel prices  
Looking forward
Southwest Airlines expects unit revenue to improve sequentially in the third quarter  with RASM roughly flat  plus or minus 1    This includes headwinds totaling 2 percentage points related to  1  an aggressive fare sale rolled out in May to counter the softness in bookings   2  continuing to run a suboptimal schedule  and  3  a change in accounting rules 
The good news is that Southwest currently estimates that none of these three factors will have a significant impact on unit revenue in the fourth quarter  That could set the stage for a return to meaningful RASM growth 
On the cost side  adjusted nonfuel unit costs are expected to rise 2  to 3  in the third quarter but just 0  to 1  for the full year  Meanwhile  the company estimates that it will pay  2 25 per gallon for fuel this quarter  up from  2 07 per gallon a year earlier  This is a much smaller headwind than what other airlines are facing  primarily because Southwest Airlines incurred massive fuel hedging losses last year 
Southwest s third quarter forecast suggests that its operating margin may fall by about 3 percentage points  This would again lead to modest earnings per share growth  driven by a lower tax rate and a lower share count  That wouldn t be a bad result considering all of the headwinds Southwest Airlines is currently facing ",2018-07-29,Adam Levine-Weinberg,https://www.investing.com/analysis/southwest-airlines-co-earnings-moving-in-the-right-direction-again-200334299,200334299

199818,421334,LUV,Exclusive  Southwest s oil swap trade waiver raises CFTC questions,news,"By Douwe Miedema  WASHINGTON  Reuters    Last month s move by the U S  commodities regulator to let Southwest Airlines Co keep its multibillion dollar oil trades secret for 15 days offered the world s biggest low cost carrier a break it has been seeking for three years   However  the decision to grant the airline an exemption from rules calling for greater derivatives transparency raised concerns about its market impact and sparked a debate among regulators  according to people familiar with the approval process   All other swap trades except Southwest s must be reported  as soon as technologically practicable    The Dallas based airline has argued that its deals are so specific that immediate disclosure could cause the market to move against it  adding tens of millions of dollars to its costs   For years  that argument was not enough to sway the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and its former chairman  Gary Gensler  One concern was that granting an exemption to just one company is unusual and could hurt others in a similar position       Also  the waiver could set a precedent that would encourage others to seek similar special treatment  restoring a veil over bigger parts of derivative markets   The agency is already looking into problems the Mexican government is facing in its vast oil hedging program after news organizations  including Reuters  reported on the country s trades using publicly available swaps trading data  said one person familiar with the agency s procedures   A CFTC spokesman said Tim Massad  Gensler s successor  had issued the waiver to Southwest after his staff had done proper analysis to confirm the company s claims  and the relief was a lot narrower than what the company had originally requested   But the person familiar with the approval process said the decision caused  a big stink  within the agency        When Southwest talked to the Commission in 2012 and in 2013   they couldn t prove their case   the source said  Barring new evidence or a further appeal  Southwest s plea appeared to reach a dead end more than a year ago       The company had another shot at an exemption when Gensler left this year  It made its case to then interim Chairman Mark Wetjen  who told the staff to start another study but doubted that a waiver was warranted  said a second source familiar with the CFTC s thinking       Only after Massad s arrival in June did things start moving  It is unclear what led to his decision to grant the waiver   LOBBY GROUP      Even those who see merits in granting a waiver have taken issue with the decision to give it to just one company  While the agency frequently issues exemptions from its rules  they generally apply to a wider industry or class of participants  or address a problem specific to one company    I m surprised that they didn t apply it across the market   another person familiar with the situation said   With its low cost tickets and clever marketing  Southwest has wide popular appeal  It says it has been on Fortune magazine s list of most admired companies in the world for 20 consecutive years  and many on Capitol Hill support it   Southwest hired Delta Strategy Group  a Washington lobbying firm replete with former CFTC staffers to make its case in Congress  Since it started its campaign  the House has passed two bills that would write the waiver into law  although it is far from certain that they would win approval in the new Congress    I SEE YOU       Rodney Davis  a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Illinois  who introduced one of these bills  welcomed the CFTC s waiver        It s a good first step to help a company out   Davis told Reuters   The rule was not initially designed to impact companies like Southwest         Southwest s hedging program  among the largest and longest running in the industry  is best known for sparing the airline the pain when oil surged to nearly  150 a barrel in 2008        While other carriers  energy bills soared  Southwest was buying its jet fuel at half price because of swaps and options positions it had locked in       But the size and frequency of its trades in long term oil contracts allow a small group of dealers at banks to figure out Southwest s positions by crunching the public data  even though the transactions are anonymous  the company says       The airline  began to get phone calls from other participants in the market saying   I see you guys are out there trading    Southwest Treasurer Chris Monroe told Reuters       That meant Southwest had to pay higher prices after the transparency rules came into force in 2012   Monroe told a Senate committee last year that reporting the trades would add  60 million to Southwest s  6 billion annual fuel bill   Shedding light on derivative markets that were at the epicenter of the financial crisis is a core goal of the Dodd Frank Wall Street reform  but non banks are complaining they sometimes end up as unintended victims       Yet critics say the waiver allows Southwest to operate in secret  a privilege others do not have  Another concern is that no single player should be so dominant that its trades alone can move prices   
The CFTC s action  looks anomalous and seems to warrant an expanded explanation   said Bart Chilton  a former Democratic commissioner who left the agency in March     Reporting by Douwe Miedema  Editing by Tomasz Janowski and Lisa Von Ahn ",2014-12-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-southwest's-oil-swap-trade-waiver-raises-cftc-questions-321104,321104

199827,421343,LUV,Does Southwest Airlines Company  LUV  Make A Suitable Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Southwest Airlines Company   NYSE LUV    stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Southwest Airlines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 38  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 85  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Southwest Airlines s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 89  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Southwest Airlines has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 13  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Southwest Airlines stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Southwest Airlines has a P S ratio of about 1 57  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 13 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years    suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Southwest Airlines currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Southwest Airlines a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Southwest Airlines might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C  This gives LUV a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate going higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and three downward movements in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 6 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Southwest Airlines Company Price and Consensus   This unfavorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking

	Chicago  IL  July 20  2017   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  Southwest  NYSE         American Airlines  LON        and Deutsche Lufthansa  DE LHAG   OTCMKTS       

Soaring Stock in a High Flying Industry

	The internet never forgets and investors tend to have long memories as well  That is why I was hesitant to write about a sector that historically hasn t been so kind to investors  Of the 22 stocks in this industry  there are 9 that carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  which has to be some kind of record 

	Now before we go any further  know that this article doesn t come with any extra fees for bags  I won t eject you from this site and forcibly remove you from your seat  The delays you experience will be more about your computer or internet provider  although the Zacks website isn t the fastest   So buckle up and be aware that your closest exit might be behind you 

The Friendly Skies 

	Lately  the friendly skies haven t been so friendly  Aside from the removal of passenger by force  there was a recent dust up from a conservative pundit  Selecting your seat seems to be the new way the airlines are using to drum up fees  but at the end of the day  higher fees often mean higher earnings 

	Earnings estimates are the driving force behind the Zack Rank and with so many airlines getting positive estimate revisions we end of with the industry soaring the top 3  of all industries 

	With 20  returns YTD for the group  let s take a look at a few of the high fliers  

Southwest

Southwest  NYSE        is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has some great style score  with a B for value and an A for growth  The company has a so so record when it comes to a recent earnings history with two beats and two misses of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  That is a factor in the Zacks Rank  but not nearly as important as the number of positive revisions 

	When I look at the agreement section of the detailed estimates page      all I see is a blizzard of positive estimate revisions in 7  30 and 60 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year has moved from  3 76 to  3 90 over the last 90 days  At the same time the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 moved from  4 57 to  4 80 

	LUV trades at 16x forward earnings and 18x trailing earnings  A price to sales multiple of 1 8x is also right in line with the industry average 

   

I Am a Real American

	When Hulk Hogan made his way to the squared circle  also known as the wrestling ring  his theme song had a chorus of  I am a real American   Hulk is strong and my leads ins are weak  but the earnings estimate revisions for American Airlines  LON        have been strong 

	AAL is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and I like this play a lot as it has a positive earnings ESP  This tells me that an analyst has very recently increased estimates over the consensus and analyst that do that with just a week or so before earnings are telling you they are confident in an upcoming beat  The logic is simple  the analyst that waits the longest to publish numbers or update their model has the most information on the quarter 

	The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the coming quarter has been moving higher  The number has soared to  1 82 from  1 56 just 90 days ago  Along the way there were more than 17 earnings estimate revision to the upside  That is a lot of confidence in the quarter 

   

A Great Chart

	In looking at the chart for the last three months I almost drooled on the keyboard   Deutsche Lufthansa  OTCMKTS        is also a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that has an A for value and a D for growth 

	I don t want to go too deep into this stock  but clearly  when a German airline is seeing positive estimate revisions as well as a number of our domestic airlines  you know you have a strong sector rotation at hand 

	This stock has really soared since the start of the year and you can see on this chart how the earnings estimate revision have been the thrust beneath this stocks wings 

Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside 

	Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana 

	Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look

Buy 5 Stocks with Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio 

	We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for a short horizon investor to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results 

	A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio 

Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense   

Why Interest Coverage Ratio 

	Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt 

	Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision 

	Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest 

	An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time 

The Winning Strategy

	Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to better results 

Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry Median

Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 

5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median   Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history 

Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median   This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 

VGM Score of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

	Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening 

KB Home   NYSE        which operates as a homebuilding company  has a VGM score of  A  and an expected EPS growth rate of 16 7  for 3 5 years  The stock currently flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  You can see     

Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE        which operates a passenger airline  has a VGM score of  A  and an expected EPS growth rate of 10 2  for 3 5 years  The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank  1

199857,421373,LUV,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  United Continental Holdings  Southwest Airlines  Ryanair Holdings And Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 05  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include United Continental Holdings  NYSE           Southwest Airlines  NYSE           Ryanair Holdings plc  NASDAQ          and Deutsche Lufthansa  DE LHAG  Aktiengesellschaft  OTCMKTS          

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  

4 Airline Stocks that Outperformed the Industry in May 

	It is a well documented fact that the airline stocks reported mixed results in the first quarter of 2017  Even though a fair share of sector participants came out with better than expected earnings per share  bottom line growth was negligible due to high costs  Moreover  with many airline players inking labor deals  it was of no surprise that the surge in labor costs hurt the bottom line 

	Bulk of the reports was out in the month of April  Apart from the mediocre earnings performance  many airline stocks led by United Continental Holdings  NYSE         encountered serious customer related issues  Notably  these factors led to the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of a mere 2 6  in April 

Improved Performance in May 

	Despite disappointing performance in April  airline stocks gained significantly in May on the back of several positive factors 

Investor Friendly Measures

	The month of May also saw airline heavyweights like and Southwest Airlines  NYSE         hiking their respective quarterly dividend payouts apart from announcing fresh buyback plans 

	Delta raised its quarterly dividend to 30 5 cents per share  annualized  1 22 per share   representing an increase of 50 6  over the previous payout of 20 25 cents per share  annualized 81 cents per share   Additionally  the Atlanta  GA based carrier s board of directors cleared a new  5 billion share buyback program  The new share repurchase plan is expected to be completed by June 2020 

	Close on the heels of Delta s quarterly dividend hike  the Dallas  TX based Southwest Airlines announced a dividend raise along with a new share repurchase program worth  2 billion 

	In fact  this low cost carrier raised its cash quarterly dividend to 12 5 cents per share  50 cents per share annualized   representing an increase of 25  over the previous quarterly payout of 10 cents per share  40 cents per share annualized  

A4A s Bullish View 

	The bullish view of Airlines for America   A4A     the largest airline trade association in the U S    regarding air travel for the summer season was another positive incident to have taken place in May 

	The organization has predicted that the three month period  Jun1  Aug 31  will be the busiest for U S  carriers in terms of air travel  Strong demand for travel on the back of an improving economy is expected to drive passenger volumes to an all time high 

	Moreover  the volume  234 1 million  is likely to be 4  higher than the year ago figure  We also note that the air travel projection for the summer season translates into 2 54 million fliers per day  during the said period  Apart from an improving economy  consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans taking vacations  Read More     

Other Tailwinds

	Late last month  members of OPEC and some non OPEC producers announced their decision to extend the current level of production cut until the first quarter of 2018  The decision disappointed investors leading to a drop in oil prices below the  50 a barrel mark  This  airline stocks as lower oil prices mean good news for airline stocks 

	Moreover  in the same month it was revealed that Warren Buffett  founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   increased his stakes in American Airlines and Southwest Airlines in the first quarter of 2017 by 8  and 10   respectively  We believe that as Buffett is one of the most revered investors of all times  his continued efforts to root for airline stocks is a major positive for the sector 

Stocks that Outshined the Industry

	In view of the above positives it is of little wonder that the Zacks Transportation Airline industry doubled its gain in May compared with the level in April  However  there are certain players in the space who performed even better 

	We note that with a plethora of stocks present in the airline space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to pinpoint potential outperformers  This is where the Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy 

	To this end  we have shortlisted four companies that have outperformed the industry in May  and sport a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   You can see   

4 Solid Picks

Ryanair Holdings plc   NASDAQ         is an Irish low fare airliner that primarily operates from Europe  The carrier sports a Zacks Rank  1  The stock has rallied 16 2  in May outperforming the Zacks Transportation Airline industry s gain of 5 3

Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  

	Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge

	It s not the one you think

199879,421395,LUV,Stocks Rebound After Brief Dip,opinion,"After a brief dip midday  U S  equities recovered to finish higher following a stronger than expected nonfarm payroll report  Meanwhile  crude oil prices fell  as did the U S  dollar  and Treasury yields dipped as political uncertainty continued to linger  Gold inched higher  News on the equity front was on the light side 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  rose 45 points  0 2   to 20 903  the S P 500 Index added 8 points  0 3   to 2 373  and the NASDAQ Composite increased 23 points  0 4   to 5 862  In moderate volume  838 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 2 0 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil lost  0 79 to  48 49 per barrel and wholesale gasoline shed  0 02 to  1 60 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg Gold spot price ticked  3 25 higher to  1 204 49 per ounce  and the dollar index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was 0 6  lower at 101 28  Markets were lower for the week  as the DJIA decreased 0 5   the S P 500 Index declined 0 4   and the Nasdaq Composite was 0 2  lower 
Ulta Beauty Inc  NASDAQ ULTA  286  reported 4Q earnings per share  EPS  of  2 24  above the  2 14 FactSet estimate  as revenues rose 24 6  year over year  y y  to  1 6 billion  above the projected  1 5 billion  4Q same store sales rose 16 6  y y  compared to the expected 13 8  gain  The company s gross margin came in a bit shy of the Street s estimates and its 1Q and full year guidance missed forecasts  Separately  ULTA announced a new  425 million share repurchase program  Shares gained solid ground 
Finisar Corp   NASDAQ FNSR  27  posted fiscal 3Q EPS of  0 40  or  0 59 ex items  below the projected  0 62  as revenues grew 2 9  y y to  381 million  south of the estimated  390 million  The fiber optics equipment company s gross margin missed expectations  FNSR issued 4Q guidance that was below expectations  Shares fell sharply 
Southwest Airlines Co   NYSE LUV  56  saw some pressure after lowering its 1Q guidance for key industry metric revenue per available seat mile  RASM   citing loss of traffic from heavy California rainfall and unexpected softness in close in demand in the second half of February  that has since rebounded in March  
February labor report shows job growth tops forecasts 
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 235 000 jobs month over month  m m  in February  compared to the Bloomberg forecast of a 200 000 increase  The rise of 227 000 seen in January was upwardly revised to a gain of 238 000 jobs  The total upward revision to the job gains in January and December was 9 000  Excluding government hiring and firing  private sector payrolls increased by 227 000  versus the forecasted gain of 215 000  after increasing by 221 000 in January  revised down from the 237 000 rise that was initially reported 
Construction job growth posted the strongest monthly gain in nearly a decade and manufacturing employment rose at the fastest pace since August 2013  per Bloomberg  though the unseasonably warm weather in February likely pulled some of gains forward  Other sectors showing job growth were healthcare  mining and private educational services  but retail employment edged down 
The unemployment rate dipped to 4 7  from 4 8   matching forecasts  while the labor force participation rate ticked higher  Average hourly earnings rose 0 2  m m  versus projections of a 0 3  increase  and January s favorably revised 0 2  gain  Compared to last year  wage growth was 2 8   matching expectations and the prior month s upwardly revised figure  Finally  average weekly hours remained at January s unrevised 34 4 rate  in line with estimates 
Today s report is having no impact on an already almost 100  probability that the Fed hikes rates next week  Also  the data  notably the slight uptick in hourly earnings  appears to be in that sweet spot  keeping expectations of a faster than expected pace of rate hikes for the rest of the year in check and not rattling the markets  The economic picture continues to look good  but inflation is heating up  and we are watching to see if this could force the Fed s hand  History compiled by Strategas Research Partners shows that the best stock market performance during a rate hiking cycle comes when the Fed moves slowly in the first year  but quicker in the second year  That pattern appears to be panning out in this cycle 
Treasuries finished higher  as the yield on the 2 year note dipped 2 basis points  bps  to 1 36   while the yields on the 10 year note and the 30 year bond decreased 3 bps to 2 58  and 3 16   respectively 
The equity markets modestly extended yesterday s slight rebound that snapped a three session losing streak  while Treasury yields pared a weekly rally and the U S  dollar saw pressure  with political uncertainty remaining and economic data buoying sentiment amid the heightened expectations of a Fed rate hike next week 
Europe higher following jobs data and as oil recovers
European equities finished mostly higher  led by oil   gas issues  which rebounded even as crude oil prices failed to recover from a two day tumble  while the markets digested another solid U S  employment report  Yesterday s relatively upbeat economic tone from the European Central Bank  as it left its monetary policy stance unchanged  continued to lift bond yields  which buoyed the financial sector  Political uncertainty took a back seat to the global economic optimism  though a key French Presidential election looms 
In economic news  the German trade surplus shrank more than expected and French industrial production declined unexpectedly  while the UK reported a smaller than expected trade deficit and declines in manufacturing and industrial production  The euro jumped and the British pound was little changed versus the U S  dollar 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly higher  with yesterday s relatively upbeat economic tone from the European Central Bank and optimism of another strong U S  employment report later today helping overshadow festering global political uncertainty and heightened expectations of a U S  rate hike next week  The political uncertainty was exacerbated by a court ruling in South Korea upholding a parliamentary vote to impeach President Park 
Japanese equities rallied  with the yen falling  and South Korea s KOSPI Index gained modest ground  Australia s markets saw gains  despite the continued pullback in basic resources  and India s bourse ticked higher amid continued caution as exit polls from state elections continued to be eyed 
Stocks in China were mixed  with shares traded in the mainland dipping slightly  while those in Hong Kong increased  on the heels of yesterday s data showing mixed inflation rates and lending statistics  while the markets focused on resurfacing liquidity currency concerns  Moreover  despite the mixed Chinese data yesterday  which may have been impacted by the Lunar New Year holiday  the nation has reported a string of stronger than expected economic reports that is fostering concerns that the central bank may tighten monetary policy 
Stocks post rare post election red figures
U S  stocks snapped a four week winning streak  with political uncertainty continuing to hamper conviction as the markets grapple with the timing and details of President Donald Trump s policies and as a key French Presidential election moved closer  Also  last weekend s firing of ballistic missiles by North Korea off its east coast exacerbated geopolitical concerns  while the markets braced for a Fed rate hike next week as expectations remain near a 100  probability 
The energy sector was pressured as crude oil prices plunged on flared up supply concerns  while financials also pared a post election rally even as Treasury yields rallied  However  as the week matured  stocks snapped a three session losing streak as global economic optimism appeared to catch a tailwind after ADP s employment report blew away expectations and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi noted that the cyclical recovery may be gaining momentum after leaving its policy stance unchanged  The relatively upbeat tone boosted the euro and aided a downside reversal of early week gains for the U S  dollar  The technology sector was the lone sector to post a gain on the week  extending its recent run 
The table is set for next week s full loaded economic calendar  headlined by Wednesday s conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee s  FOMC  two day monetary policy meeting  which is expected to deliver a 25 bp hike to the target fed funds rate  The markets are likely to pay close attention to the statement and accompanying updated economic projections  which includes individual fed funds forecasts from FOMC participants  known as the dot plots  to see if the pace of rate hikes is expected to accelerate beyond current expectations  This will be followed by the customary press conference by Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen  which typically garners heavy focus 
Next week will also bring a plethora of key reads on small business optimism  producer and consumer price inflation  retail sales  housing starts and building permits  industrial production and capacity utilization  leading indicators  and consumer sentiment  There are solid economic supports for the market s surge  but gains may have gotten a bit ahead of themselves  Be prepared for a pullback  but don t fear it marks the end of the bull market  We would likely view any pullbacks as buying opportunities for those needing to add to equity exposure  while also taking some of the pressure off from sentiment 
The international calendar will bring some data worth noting  Australia consumer confidence and employment change  China retail sales  fixed asset investment and industrial production  India whole and consumer price inflation and trade balance  Japan machine orders and the Bank of Japan s monetary policy decision  Eurozone industrial production  consumer price inflation  and the trade balance  along with German investor confidence  UK employment change and the Bank of England monetary policy decision ",2017-03-12,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-rebound-after-brief-dip-200178509,200178509

In the second quarter of 2016  the company had reported lower than expected earnings per share  The company underperformed in spite of low fuel costs which should have boosted the bottom line  Quarterly revenues of  426 million also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  447 million  However  on a year over year basis  revenues improved 3 6  
Things appear to be bleak even this time around as our quantitative model doesn t hint at an earnings beat  Here s why 
Virgin America doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Virgin America is  1 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 99 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny 
Zacks Rank  Virgin America carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Please note that we caution against Sell rated stocks going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative earnings estimate revisions  The third quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for Virgin America has gone down by 15 cents to  1 00 over the last three months VIRGIN AMERICA Price and EPS Surprise
 

   
Looking at the fundamentals  here are the factors that should be at play More than the earnings numbers  investors await updates on the impending acquisition of Virgin America by Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK    The deal  worth approximately  4 billion inclusive of debt and capitalized aircraft operating leases  was inked in Apr 2016  According to various media reports  the deal  expected to close by the end of this year  has run into rough weather  In view of the uncertainty  updates on the progress of the deal would be highly awaited 
Apart from updates on the merger  focus will remain on passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM   a key measure of unit revenue  as Virgin America  like most other carriers such as Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV    is struggling with respect to unit revenues  The metric had declined 9  in the second quarter 
A Stock to Consider
With Virgin America likely to disappoint  we present below a transportation stock likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this earnings season  as per our quantitative model 
Navios Maritime Holdings Inc    NYSE NM    which is expected to report third quarter earnings on Nov 28  has an Earnings ESP of  16 00  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

199931,421447,LUV,Here s Why Southwest Airlines  LUV  Stock Is Nosediving Today,opinion,"Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    before market open Thursday  and the results were not taken well by investors  causing a major sell off of the stock  The airline posted EPS  on an adjusted basis  of  1 19  falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 22  Earnings did  however  increase 15 5  on a year over year basis 
LUV reported savings on fuel of 10  during the quarter  and returned an operating margin in excess of 18   What really worried investors was the company s warning that it is expecting unit revenue to fall as much as 4  next quarter due to lower ticket prices and greater level of competition  Its most recent quarter saw ticket prices fall 3 7  
LUV s unfavorable earnings report came just a day after computer failures caused the company to cancel 400 flights  and delay nearly 2 000  The airline had temporarily halted all flight departures at one point yesterday as it worked to resolve issues that impacted several technology systems  This isn t the first occurrence of something like this either for Southwest  as last October a similar outage caused about 800 flight delays when employees had to issue tickets and boarding passes by hand 
Southwest is down around 11  today in afternoon trade  and is down more than 13  year to date  but the stock has been one of the best investments in the airline space for some time  Since the beginning of 2014  LUV gained more than 100   as its low cost structure sparked growth that excited investors

199932,421448,LUV,Southwest Stock  Market Overreaction Creates Buying Opportunity,opinion,"After announcing 2Q16 earnings  Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  fell nearly 12   as investors seemed to care more about Southwest s ability to hit analyst expectations    and less about the company s record profits 
Investors are overlooking the fact that the company s lowered revenue guidance was already priced into the stock s valuation  as we ll show below  We believe this decline is an overreaction and creates a great buying opportunity  which we saw before the stock s decline when we made LUV our  and included it in our 
Guidance Remains Well Above Market Expectations For Cash Flows
Profits are growing strongly just as they have been for decades  The problem  at least for short term investors  was guidance that unit revenues would fall 3 4  while costs were increasing about 1  
Those numbers are a drop in the bucket compared to the cash flow declines already baked into the current stock price  At its current price of  38 share  LUV has a price to economic book value    ratio of 0 7  This ratio implies that the market expects LUV s profits to permanently decline by 30  
As we noted in our Long Idea of the Week report  since 2009  Southwest s after tax profit    has grown by 52  compounded annually  Figure 1 has details  The stock is even more attractive today as expectations for future cash flows are lower now 
Even if the conditions that caused the lowered guidance persist  we think it is safe to say that Southwest will do better than a permanent 30  decline in profits over its remaining life 
If Southwest can   the stock is worth  66 share today   a 74  upside  Couple in Southwest s share repurchase activity and the company s dividend  which could yield upwards of 6   and its easy to see why now may be the time to take a look at LUV

199945,421461,LUV,What To Buy Now  Amidst The Brexit Turmoil  2 Opportunities,opinion,"Why is there an EU  The original reasoning was that a United States of Europe would end wars on the continent 
Yet almost all Brexit commentary concentrates solely on economic impact  This act transcends mere economics 
In crisis  there is always opportunity  Brexit is no different  Here are two ways to profit from what is likely to follow 
In numerous discussions with clients and colleagues  I stated my belief that Brexit would carry the day and  indeed  if I were a Brit  that s how I would have voted 
We need to remember that the primary raison d etre for the formation of what we today call the EU was not based on economic issues  but rather security issues  After two world wars tore apart the infrastructure of European nations and left permanent scars upon its populace  those still alive swore they must never again allow their bickering to reach the point of open conflict 
The Brexit and Grexit crises du jour  however  are mostly discussed as being solely about economics and trade  which demonstrates that the original reason for the organization doesn t even register today  MetLife s CEO complained on Friday 

 From a strictly economic perspective  it s difficult to see who benefits from this outcome  

He s missing the point  It s about culture  It s about independence  It s about history  It s about custom  and it s about a sense of person  purpose and place  as well as the economy 
The western European nations  ex the UK  no longer have the will or the wherewithal to conduct aggression against each other  Heck  they won t even pony up  under a US umbrella  to resist a resurgent czarist Russia  Many already want sanctions removed on Russia because  after all  the bald faced invasion of Ukraine was so yesterday 
Lenin may yet be proven right   The Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them   And it seems they ll jockey for position to be able to do so 
The problem  as I see it  is that all the bureaucrats hired to accomplish the minor miracle of at least creating an  economic  union that for 50 years past has been somewhat beneficial  now have to do something to justify their existence  Enter Parkinson s Law and the rise of the self licking ice cream cones 
I was in Hungary last month fixing a pair of chipped and battered front teeth and asked for a whitening while I was there  Dr  Henrietta  my dentist of a couple years now  informed me that they were no longer allowed to whiten teeth because Brussels has decided hydrogen peroxide is too dangerous   The fines alone would force us to close our clinic  she said  What high economic  social  medical or military problem was in search of a solution so Draconian that bureaucrats halfway across the continent found tooth whitening of such concern to keep tabs on and make regular inspections of 
How deeply will this  federal  power be allowed to penetrate into each nation s business 
That is why I believed Brexit would succeed  The Brits are a feisty lot  as are the Scots and the Irish  I was pretty sure the backbone of Britain had endured enough EU meddling  For instance  since the EU has classified wood as  carbon neutral   huh   and coal as the work of the devil  the US now sells wood pellets to the UK for power generation   about 3 million tons a year   at much greater expense to the ultimate consumer 
If a British cheese maker wants to sell cheese in France  it doesn t mean Gerald calls up Henri and asks if he d like some of the British Stilton for his fromagerie in Lyon  Oh no  all this is determined at the most faraway level from the two cheese sellers 
What s next  the average Briton wonders  Driving on the right side of the road  Labeling cheese to the US only in kilograms  Ordering 500 ml of Newcastle Brown Ale instead of ordering a pint 
I ve seen many eloquently stated cases made for trouble down the road for the United Kingdom of England and Wales   O guess that would be the new name if Northern Ireland and Ireland merge and Scotland becomes its own nation with an economy dependent upon sheep  a pitifully small amount of oil that might be transferred  and whisky   which  as a courtesy to my ancestors I would do my part to keep flowing and profitable   But the bottom line is that the UK gives more to the EU than it gets in return 
I believe the bakers and cheese sellers and the rest of the working class and entrepreneurial class in the United Kingdom will actually thrive ex the EU  They will negotiate new and better trading treaties with the EU  their other current trading partners and  most assuredly  new trading partners 
 Maybe there s a lesson here for the US about faraway bureaucracies deciding what is best for member states  as well  
I see two immediate opportunities here  one short term and one slightly longer 
As long as there is short term turmoil  the euro may be the most vulnerable currency out there  This is consistent with my belief that Britain s decision to exit the EU will be good for Britain  not so good for the EU 
The ProShares UltraShort Euro ETF  NYSE EUO  provides a simple way to play this possibility  I have already initiated a position in EUO  If you perform your own due diligence and decide it is worth considering  I suggest you place a tight trailing stop on the position  I am using a 5  stop  Currencies can be volatile  and if there is a  relief rally  next week the euro will likely rally with it  I consider this a trade  though if it looks as if the euro will remain weak  I will consider widening my trailing stop as the price of EUO advances 
The longer term investment is to buy Ireland  I have done so via a closed end fund selling at a discount  The New Ireland Fund  NYSE IRL  has fallen steadily as the Brexit   Bremain debate wore on  It fell an additional nearly  10  on Friday   Such clever names to shorthand these big issues  Brexit  Bremain  Grexit  You read it here first  when Spain makes noises about leaving  to save pundits the mental anguish  I ve already coined the term in advance   Spanxit   
Ireland is still a member of the EU  Ireland still uses the euro  Ireland and England will continue to be neighbors  I would predict in the same way that Sweden  an EU member  and Norway  not in the EU  are neighbors that share a somewhat common heritage and similar policies 
The New Ireland Fund is heavily concentrated  It s two biggest positions  at roughly 21  each  are NYSE ADR listed CRH PLC  NYSE CRH  and discount airline Ryanair  NASDAQ RYAAY  
CRH is the second biggest building materials company on the planet  In 2015  37  of the company s sales and 27  of EBITDA were derived from European operations  They still will be  They are also the  1 building materials company in North America and the leading supplier of product for highway repair and maintenance in the US  with operations in all 50 U S  states and 9 Canadian provinces  They still will be  Brexit will have some effect  but basically the selloff in CRH is a knee jerk reaction  This company is global  with global revenues and global earnings  that has been sold in fear  but fear not grounded in reality 
Ryanair  the short haul passenger airline based in Ireland  offers some 1600 flights per day all over Europe  Could they be harmed if Britain follows through and exits the EU  I doubt it  It s not as if the British will shut down Ryanair s access to Stansted  the airport outside London   It s waaayy outside  but that s Ryanair for you  See  for a delightful spoof of Ryanair s  low fares   Yet more and more people keep flying them  
My guess is that companies like Ryanair  and CRH  are already discussing continuing business relationships with the UK  Owning 315 Boeing 737s  and 6 more leased  RYAAY is basically a copy of Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  in terms of operating efficiency  though more like US cable companies in terms of customer service 
Other primary holdings of IRL include Kingspan Group  IR KSP   also in the building materials business but with a energy efficient products and renewable energy solutions twist  Kerry Group PLC  IR KYGa   the consumer food and beverage company  and Smurfit Kappa Group PLC  OTC SMFKY  the big container board and other paper based packaging products company that sells its products all over Europe and the Americas 
IRL sells at a 12  discount to NAV and has traditionally paid a 10  dividend that comes solely from capital gains and dividend income  not from return of capital   A caveat here  if the stock prices of their holdings stay at these levels or decline further  I imagine we could see a temporary disruption in the flow of capital gains distributions in the short term 
The bottom line   This  too  shall pass   And when it does I believe the UK will emerge stronger and more confident  I believe the same is not true of the EU  hence my purchase of EUO  And I believe the ancillary damage to some firms  inaccurately tarred with the same brush as all British firms  is overdone  hence my purchase of IRL

In my last WTWA  I predicted another week about Brexit  with emphasis on the possibility of a market turning point  That is certainly how the week started  CNBC even bumped Shark Tank and the West Texas guys from the 7PM EDT slot for another round of Markets in Turmoil  After stocks moved higher  the schedule went back to normal 
Last week s  Final Thoughts  section was also on target  suggesting a weak Monday  but emphasizing the need for investors to consider the plausible range for the week s trading 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart from Doug Short  You can clearly see the exciting path for the week   early weakness in the S P 500 from the continuing Brexit selling  a big  three day rally  and a flat Friday as people left early for the long weekend  Doug has a special knack for pulling together all of the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis and several other charts providing long term perspective 

The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The Good
The ATA trucking index for May was strong up 2 7  on a seasonally adjusted basis and 5 7  year over year     
Congress and the President managed enough cooperation to pass Puerto Rico relief legislation     
Consumer confidence increased significantly to 98 versus the prior reading of 92 4  This beat estimates by over 5 points  but  that the survey preceded the Brexit news 
Personal spending increased 0 4  m o m and almost 5  over the prior year  This will be a positive for Q2 GDP 
Fed stress tests were positive  as was the case last week  This past week the question was whether banks could execute plans for dividends and stock buybacks  Nearly all passed  but Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  was a notable exception     
The ISM report was strong  The index reading of 53 2  if annualized  is consistent with GDP growth of 3 2    this relationship 

Looking at the  provides some useful color 

The ISM also has a  on expected Brexit effects  I found them to be surprisingly small  The Chicago PMI also showed a very strong increase     
The Bad
The rail contraction continues although the rolling averages are improving a bit   has the update 
Pending home sales decreased 3 7  in May and 0 2  y o y     
Construction spending decreased 0 8  in May   that this is mostly from public spending  illustrating with this chart 

The Ugly
Rio Olympics  The stories are starting to mount  with the  calling it a perfect storm of problems  The recession has crushed budgets for public services  Violence and pollution have grabbed headlines  Zika is causing some athletes to reconsider participation  It is a shame that a great tradition is threatened 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  This week s winner is CNBC anchor Sara Eisen  for her first rate  myth busting interview with Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer    and  via CNBC   One by one she asked all of the key questions in the current debate over Fed policy   potential for negative rates  Brexit impact  does the Fed make decisions based the economic impact abroad  the state of the economy  recession potential  employment  George Soros  and the strong bond market  Whether or not you agree with Vice Chairman Fischer  it is important to know what he thinks 
Sara Eisen displayed first rate journalism  as expected from a  graduate  Unlike so many other financial interviewers she did not argue with her subject nor push her own agenda  She did raise all of the current Fed misperceptions common in the trading community  Her preparation and poise helped us all learn important information  It was well worth turning off my mute button and dialing back the TIVO 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar
We have a big week for economic data  and only four days of trading  I expect it to start slowly culminating in the biggest news on Friday  In my calendar I highlight only the most important items  helping us all to focus 
The  A  List
Employment report  F   Deserved or not  this is always the biggest news of the month  Rebound expected 
FOMC Minutes  W   You might wonder how this could provide fresh news  The punditry will find a way 
The ISM Services Index  W   Will strength match the manufacturing index 
ADP Private Employment  Th   A good alternative to the  official  numbers 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List
Factory orders  T   Volatile May data  but an important sector
Trade Balance  W   Also May data  but a factor in gauging GDP 
Crude inventories  W   Often has a significant impact on oil markets  a focal point for traders of everything 
The week may start a bit slowly as participants return from the long weekend  There is plenty of FedSpeak for those needing a fix  More Brexit commentary and predictions will also be a feature  with emphasis on European markets and specific companies 
The Coming Week s Theme
After two weeks of Brexit stories  market participants seem ready to move on  We have a pretty busy week for economic data  with the news occurring over only four days and a sleepy start on Tuesday  Friday s employment report will be the big story of the week  and might be a multi day theme 
Despite this  I am intrigued by two posts from my blogging friend Eddy Elfenbein   Eddy seems to have scored a regular appearance gig on CNBC  His comments are always on target  and they should give him more time  I turn off the mute and TIVO back whenever I see him  
First   that the market has been in an extremely tight trading range for almost two years  Second   showing one day results for every day of the year for a 120 year period 

The two month period beginning right now has historically provided about half of the annual stock gains  Eddy wisely warns that this is interesting  but not a basis for prediction  I agree  but the theme should attract some attention 
In addition  the Fed is expected to remain on hold and Brexit worries digested  Many will be asking 
Is it time for the summer rally 
Feel free to join the discussion in the comments  but here are the key themes I see 
Bearish
The rally has created an overbought market 
Market valuation is extended and earnings are weak 
Brexit remains important   more than people realize 
There is a real threat of global recession 
Bullish
The Brexit story seems to have a favorable ending  Ed Yardeni writes 

The Brexit vote didn t change my secular bullish stance  That s because I don t believe it will cause a recession in the US  I expect that earnings growth will resume during the second half of this year and that interest rates will remain as low as they are now for the foreseeable future 


Earnings may well be at a turning point     with some support from   
Recession odds  judged by the best methods  remain very low  Stock prices erroneously reflect high macro worries 
Low interest rates make stock returns attractive to many investors

We follow some regular great sources and also the best insights from each week 
Risk Analysis
Whether you are a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  Risk first  rewards second  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update 
The Indicator Snapshot 

The Featured Sources 
Brian Gilmartin  Analysis of expected earnings for the overall market as well as coverage of many individual companies  This week he expresses more confidence about growth in earnings 
Bob Dieli  The  C Score  which is a weekly estimate of his Enhanced Aggregate Spread  the most accurate real time recession forecasting method over the last few decades   His subscribers get  including both an economic overview of the economy and employment 
This week the recession odds  in nine months  have nudged closer to 10   This does not completely reflect Brexit effects  so we may get a further revision 
Holmes  Our cautious and clever watchdog  who sniffs out opportunity like a great detective  but emphasizes guarding assets 
Doug Short  The Big Four Update  the World Markets Weekend Update  and much more  
The ECRI has been dropped from our weekly update  It was not so much because of the bad call in 2011  but the stubborn adherence to this position despite plenty of evidence to the contrary  Those interested can still  via Doug Short and Jill Mislinski  The ECRI commentary remains relentlessly bearish despite the upturn in their own index 

Georg Vrba  The   and much more   for an array of interesting methods  His  describes the elements of the indicator we cite every week 
RecessionAlert  Many  for both economic and market analysis  While we feature his recession analysis  Dwaine also has a number of interesting approaches to asset allocation  Dwaine s   shows the increase in the number of countries with back to back quarters of losses in GDP 

As we review the weekly indicators it is important to maintain perspective  A 20  chance of a recession would be average  It is not a reason for fear  since it says that a recession is very unlikely  There will be a time to exercise more caution  but we are not yet close to that point

Best Advice for the Week Ahead
The right move often depends on your time horizon  Are you a trader or an investor 
Insight for Traders
We consider both our models and also the best advice from sources we follow 
Felix and Holmes
We continue our neutral market forecast  Felix remains almost fully invested but with somewhat more cautious choices  This was good for most of the week  The more cautious Holmes is still fully invested  in selections that dodged the Brexit fallout pretty well  Holmes uses a universe of nearly 1000 stocks  selected mostly by liquidity  Even when the overall market is neutral  there will often be some strong candidates  That is what we see now  It is not a resounding endorsement of the overall market  but a vote for opportunistic trading 
Top Trading Advice
One of the reasons I enjoy and learn from Brett Steenbarger is the unique quality of his insights  He often discusses a topic that you might think is simple and obvious in retrospect  The value is that no one actually follows the key process in real time  His recent post on  is an excellent example  How many times are you in a situation where you simply do not know  How often do you admit it 
Adam H  Grimes also has   Take notes  Use them to identify biases and action points 
Insight for Investors
Investors have a longer time horizon  The best moves frequently involve taking advantage of trading volatility 
Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week  it would be Josh Brown s  about the latest round of financial scams  Josh has street cred on helping investors   often by revealing what is going on behind the scenes  I reviewed his book   noting that it would save reader thousands of dollars  I have also often cited his   written with Jeff Macke  on several occasions  What he writes is colorful  fun  and always adding to his main theme of helping the individual investor 
This week s post emphasizes that intelligent and prominent people can be victims  It happens even if you are dealing with a prestigious firm  It can easily happen to you  There are many good points  but here is the conclusion 

Peter Lynch said that  Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections than has been lost in corrections themselves   If your advisor s answer to the potential for corrections or volatility is to sell you silly  OP  ahem   stuff  from outer space  then your follow up question should be whether or not he or she gets paid for the privilege of your having bought it

Brexit Reprise

Economic predictions are already suspect  I started to quote the culprits  but decided not to  What is the point  Beware of writing when you are reaching outside of your     The basic economic effects on the U S  will be modest  Most of the dire predictions relate to falling dominoes  an easy and typical scare tactic

Personal Finance
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  The average investor should make time  even if not able to read AR every day as I do  for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his   There are always several great choices worth reading  and I have two favorites this week  The first  from Josh Brown  is reported above  The second is a brief and cleverly written story by Carl Richards  It is difficult to quote it without spoiling  so please take a few seconds to   Here is the Sketch Guy s chart 

 has a similar story about the news barrage from perma bears whenever markets turn volatile  It is well worth reading his account of past crises  looking at the charts  and enjoying the picture of a nasty looking bear  Here is a key quotation 

Right now  for instance  is a good example of when to exert your objectivity  Fear is running high  Along with that  there s a pervasive distrust of equities  But let s look a little closer  The yield on equities is roughly 2 2  versus the 10 Year Treasury yield of 1 5   Once again  there s a mad dash to safety assets  so the rates on Treasuries continue to fall  Yet the current situation actually creates a double positive for stocks  interest rates are likely to stay lower for longer  which helps support equity valuations while also providing investment grade issuers with the ability to borrow cheaply and increase shareholder value 

Watch out for  
Chasing performance from last year s best hedge funds   takes two successful funds with completely different strategies  Here is how they are now doing 

Final Thoughts
I doubt that I can match my  final thoughts  from the last two weeks  I hope readers were helped in weathering another round of macro news with plenty of speculation about U S  stocks 
The potential trading range I laid out two weeks ago was pretty much on target  The preliminary expectations about the vote led to a larger reaction than would otherwise have occurred  Media milked this for all it was worth  taking the prior Thursday close as the correct starting point  despite the run up  Just staying cool can be a challenge 
What about a summer rally  It is a good guess about the theme for the week  As is often the case for the weekly theme  I don t know the answer and neither does anyone else  That said  I rate the possibility higher than most  and therefore another good contrarian play  We have had a long time tight trading range  so a breakout would be meaningful for many  Rightly or wrongly  much will depend on the employment report 
The economy is the key to future earnings  Recession odds are low  earnings are improving  the oil issue has stabilized  and the Fed is on hold   Many  trading range worries  are now behind us ",2016-07-03,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-time-for-the-summer-rally-200139664,200139664

199965,421481,LUV,Southwest Airlines Stock  The Devil Is In The Details,opinion,"Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  stock has been in a steady uptrend since the beginning of March  2009  Starting from as low as 4 95  prices soared to as high as 51 34 dollars a share by December 2015 
If you are familiar with what we do  you know that we rely exceptionally on price charts and pattern recognition  in order to determine the most likely development in the markets  Let s take a look at the weekly chart of Southwest stock  which is going to show us how the whole uptrend since March 2009 looks through the prism of the Elliott Wave principle 
And here is the first controversy  The weekly chart of Southwest Airlines reveals not one  but two counts  none of which is looking less likely than the other  The first one suggests the stock has finished a five wave  between March 2009 and December 2015  and is currently declining in wave C of the natural A B C three wave correction  which  according to the Elliott Wave theory  follows every impulsive sequence 
So far so good  but the second count says the stock is now trading within a  in wave 4 and wave 5 to the upside should come next  Now  how do you pick one before the other  They say the devil is hiding in the details  Well  Elliotticians need to grow a habit of finding him 
We do it by looking at a smaller time frame chart  In this case   a daily one  It shows the internal structure of the price action in question 
If the rally from 32 36 to 51 34 was a fifth wave  it would have consisted of five sub waves  As visible  it only has three  marked with a b c for wave B of the triangle  which now becomes our primary count 
Ok  but within a triangle  each wave has a three wave structure  Then why is the assumed wave D impulsive  Because wave D is either still in progress or we simply need to switch to a third count  See it on the next chart 
Instead of a regular five wave impulse  wave 5 could also turn out to be an   If this is the correct count  Southwest Airlines stock is not in wave  iii  of 5  and two new all time highs could be expected 
At this stage of the Elliott Wave analysis we have eliminated count  1  because wave 5 does not have the necessary structure  Counts  2 and  3 are still on the table  Fortunately  they imply almost the same consequences  so there is no need to pick a favorite 
They both suggest that the last bottom at 33 96 should not be bothered with and that at least one new high should be seen in Southwest stock ",2016-06-07,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-devil-is-in-the-details-200134348,200134348

With the move back up  this makes for a trigger in a cup and handle pattern  The target is shown at 61 25  But it gets better  Along the way  Southwest printed a Golden Cross  with the 50 day SMA crossing up through the 200 day SMA  There s also a AB CD pattern that commits to a target of 70 on the trigger over 46 50 

Momentum is supportive with the RSI in the bullish zone  having reset and turned back higher  The MACD has pulled back a bit and a turn higher would also confirm the upside  Perhaps it s time to pack your portfolio and let LUV fly for the longer term ",2015-11-18,Gregory W.

200001,421517,LUV,Imperial Capital Remains Bullish On AAL And SUV,opinion,"of Imperial Capital provided an update on the airline industry on May 28  highlighting stocks such as American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL  and Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  
McAdoo disagrees with investors and analysts who are concerned that  management teams have lost discipline  regarding capacity growth  in light of lower jet fuel prices  and that airline shares are consequently dropping  McAdoo maintains that  most current capacity levels were planned well before the decline in jet fuel prices   As for the recent sell off in airline shares  the analyst notes that the move was  meaningfully misguided   McAdoo explains that most airlines are likely to report 2Q15 earnings  that are 40 50  higher than their previous historic best quarters  The recent 5 10  selloff in the middle of such a quarter likely creates a great opportunity for investors seeking potentially significant value driven opportunities  
Though McAdoo provides ratings for several airlines  he focuses his analysis on American Airlines and Southwest  American Airlines CEO Doug Parker spoke with Bloomberg in an interview last week in which he indicated that AAL will  compete aggressively  with discount airlines  McAdoo commented   Investors seemingly took these comments as an indication that American was starting a new more aggressive campaign that would disrupt the markets   though he does not believe that this announcement is much different than comments made by AAL in the past  He explains    American Airlines  has historically matched prices and will likely continue to do so in competitive markets   Given the size and scale of AAL  lowering certain fares will not have an impact in the company s bottom line 

Bob McAdoo currently has an Outperform rating on American Airlines with an  82 price target  He has rated the stock 9 times since April 2014 with a  2 7  average return per rating 
As for Southwest  McAdoo explained that the company  is adjusting service in its new markets and that should further alleviate pricing pressure as excess capacity is moved to new markets   The analyst believes this move will have a  positive impact on pricing   When looking at the airline s metrics for departing seats and schedules  McAdoo points out that Southwest s  presently scheduled year end 2015 departing seats are up only 3 5  versus full year 2014   He continued   When viewing Southwest s growth in the context of GDP growth  one should probably make another adjustment to these numbers as we believe the 3 5  figure probably overstates the competitive impact of Southwest s growth  McAdoo also notes that Southwest is removing 14 trips per week between Dallas and Washington DC  as well and removed two routes altogether from Washington DC to Ohio  However  Southwest plans to add capacity to three routes in the fall  all leaving from Washington DC  McAdoo concludes   As Southwest continues to tweak its  Washington DC  schedule to meet demand  we expect pricing trend trends to continue to improve  
Bob McAdoo currently has an Outperform rating on Southwest Airlines with a  64 price target  He has rated the stock 5 times since January 2014 with a  40 5  average return per LUV rating  On average  the top analyst consensus on for Southwest is Strong Buy Bob McAdoo has a 63  overall success rate recommending stocks with a  23 5  average return per rating To see more ratings by   visit TipRanks today ",2015-06-01,Sarah Roden,https://www.investing.com/analysis/imperial-capital-remains-bullish-on-american-airlines-group-inc-(aal)-an-253604,253604
200002,421518,LUV,Southwest Airlines  Strong Sell  Analyst Outlook Bleak,opinion,"Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  was recently downgraded to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  as a significant number of analysts estimates for the stock have been lowered for the current and next quarter  as well as for the next quarter and year  After being one of the top performing stocks on the S P 500 last year  the company has seen its stock price decline by approximately 25  from its all time high in January  The following is a figure that shows the earnings estimate revisions made by analysts in the recent past 

One can clearly see that analysts do not feel as strongly about Southwest s stock as they once did  After having such a strong prior year  the current and following years do not seem to have as positive of an outlook  in analysts  opinions  Specifically  analysts from Barclays  LONDON BARC  released a report in which they changed their rating on Southwest  from overweight  to underweight  stating that the company s growth will likely normalize in 2016  The analysts from Barclays also changed their price target from  50 down to  39  Southwest has high growth projection percentages for the current quarter  50 86    the next quarter  65 05    and the current year  70 01    but their projected growth percentage for next year   83   represents the expectation of a major drop off in growth  While this does stem from the company simply not growing as much next year as it will this year  it is also because of the massive amount of growth felt by the company this year is just not sustainable as time goes on and especially given the intense competition  Southwest is still poised for growth in the current year  but investors should not expect the company to continue to grow at the current magnitude that it has been  As of now  we have the stock as a Strong Sell  meaning it is in the bottom 5  of stocks in the ranking system  It will be interesting to follow how Southwest s stock  as well as the company as a whole  fares throughout the rest of this year as the cutthroat airline market hits a variety of stocks in this in focus sector ",2015-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/southwest-airlines-(luv)-moves-to-strong-sell,-analyst-outlook-bleak-255574",255574

200005,421521,LUV,Volatility Is Back  Trade This Moving Market Like A Pro,opinion,"Unless you ve been living under a rock  you know that stock markets around the world suffered a major blow on Monday 
All three major U S  indices ended the day in full blown correction territory 
The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index which measures CBOE call volume and is also known as the market s  fear gauge   spiked above 50 for the first time since 2009 
Now  it s far too early to say whether we ve seen the bottom or not  But the outlook isn t as grim as you might think 
What s more  the worst thing to do on a day like Monday is sell  Believe me  the investors making real money are those buying the dips  It s a tough concept for some people to get their minds around  but corrections provide some of the most rewarding opportunities 
And if you think you ve missed your chance to buy some stocks on the cheap  you re dead wrong  Using one powerful technical indicator  you can trade this volatile market like a pro for weeks to come 
I m talking about the Relative Strength Index  RSI   which is one of the most useful technical indicators out there  Its value is enhanced even further during times of intense market volatility 
RSI measures a stock s momentum using a simple formula that determines strength or weakness and grades on a scale from 0 to 100  When you hear an analyst talking about a stock being  oversold  or  overbought   they re probably referring to RSI 
Typically  a reading below 30 indicates a stock is oversold and a reading above 70 means a stock is overbought  As of Tuesday s open  80  of the S P 500 s constituents were oversold  The Index itself had an RSI reading of 28 

Buying a stock you want when it s oversold can be the difference between paltry returns and super charged gains  Let s take a look at an example 
The last time the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  fell below 16 000 points was in October 2014  You ll recall that was the height of the Ebola scare  and airline stocks took a huge hit 15  in Two Weeks Thanks to RSI
Despite a major operational restructuring and strong early year performance  Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  wasn t spared  It fell 18  last October from its all time high just one month prior  The stock s RSI fell from 90  extremely overbought  to 15  extremely oversold  in the blink of an eye 
So how could a savvy investor have played this selloff opportunity on a red hot stock using RSI 
The most efficient way to use RSI is to buy when the stock price crosses back above 30   the oversold threshold  This RSI cross implies that a stock s momentum has swung back to the upside 
Using this example  RSI on Southwest crossed above 30 on October 13  Just a few weeks later  shares shot back up to  34 59  and the stock s RSI crossed above 70  implying overbought conditions 
Once Southwest became overbought  you could ve sold shares when the RSI fell back to 70 and bagged an easy 15   Or  you could ve ridden them through the end of the year to a 41  gain 

Now s the Time to Make Your Move
Right now  the market is showing an even juicier opportunity than last year s Ebola dip 
Of course  there s always a chance that things could get worse before they get better  But it s safe to say that after Tuesday s pop  bullish sentiment is alive and well in this market  The smart money is buying stocks from their watch list and gearing up for the inevitable oversold bounce in the broad market 
Using RSI  you can do the same and take advantage of this volatile market

200018,421534,LUV,Why It Is A Good Time To Buy Shares Of American Airlines,opinion,American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL   recently completed another major step towards completing its 2013 merger with US Airways  The Federal Aviation Administration has  the airliners a certificate to operate as one airline  The merger makes American Airlines Group the world s largest airline  And with this development  we are closer to the time when we can start seeing the full benefit of this merger  In here  we ll attempt to dig into some events that have occurred since the merger to see why investors just have to be optimistic about the future of this airliner  Perhaps the biggest benefit so far is that the merger has helped American Airlines improve its profitability  Before the merger in 2013  American s gross margin was moving closely to the gross margin of Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  below the 50 percent market  However  since the merger American s gross margin has skyrocketed  now standing at 66 31 percent  compared to Southwest s 58 73 percent  It is worthy to mention that Southwest has also been growing its profitability due to its merger with AirTran in 2012  However  with the huge stature of US Airways  American seems to be coming out on top as the Airline industry continues its consolidation  One of the reasons American is coming out on top in the new consolidated airline industry is that the company chose to merge with one of the biggest competitors possible within the industry  You d understand better when you consider that AirTran reported a revenue of  2 6 billion for 2010 compared to US Airways   11 9 billion  In fact  since Southwest reported a revenue of just  12 1 billion in 2010  the merger is more like American Airlines merging with an airline with a stature similar to that of Southwest  As a result  American has been able to cut the costs of competing with another  Southwest  in form of the merger with US Airways  As a result  we can expect that  once the merger is complete  American will be more profitable  My point that American has been able to cut the cost of competing with a major competitor in US Airways through the merger is also obvious in the spread between the company s operating revenues and operating expenses   or operating income  I have taken the time to plot a chart of it  in comparison to that of Southwest below Data gotten from each company s 2014 Form 10 K  As the chart shows  prior to the merger  Southwest was able to keep a larger share of its operating revenues as operating income  However  since the merger in 2013  American has improved on this front by a wide margin  By implication  American has been increasing its operating revenues faster than its operating expenses  Again  this is partly attributable to the fact that American now has more time to render quality services than thinking about how to silence competitors   something that will always weigh on operating expenses  It is important to note that the merger has  affected American s business to some extent  For instance  the merger has brought confusion about airfare  with an interviewed customer complaining that he got different prices for the exact same trip after his US Airways account was merged to American  There are certainly many other customers with similar complaints  and this would have gone to some extent to reduce the company s traffic  However  once all these kinks have been worked out  as the merger is completed  we can expect more travelers to be confident in American again  Moreover  the completion of the merger will also help the company ramp up its marketing effort  American s marketing efforts would be inherently limited right now to afford confusions  since the two companies are probably still working out their policies  However  once the two companies are fully one   standing for the same things and having the same policies   we can expect innovative marketing to begin  which should position the company to take greater advantage of the burgeoning air travel demand  In addition  I believe American would see more traveler to traveler recommendation  as it is also improving its inflight entertainment with improved  and several interesting games  It offers games like chess  casino  just like William Hill s online  without the betting  In fact  travelers can see what s available for each month on its entertainment website  All of this would only help bring out the full benefit of the merger  Another added value that should help the company on the long term is that also helps secure its customers by partnering with Allianz  XETRA ALVG  Global Assistance to offer tailor made competitive insurance packages for its traveler  which includes but not limited to auto insurance  By way of bringing it together  the latest single operating certificate development  should remind investors of the benefits that the merger of two of the largest airlines offers  And with a forward PE of 5 52  compared to Southwest s 11 60  American looks cheap at current levels and now may be a good time to buy shares of American Airlines ,2015-04-10,Craig
