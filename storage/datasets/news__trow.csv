145583,367098,TROW,Can T  Rowe Price Continue to Outperform ,news,"The stock market is coming off a strong year in 2019  which was great for asset management companies that invest in securities in their mutual funds and portfolios  One of those firms  T  Rowe Price  NASDAQ TROW   had a particularly good year  up approximately 32  in 2019 and 37  over the past 12 months  The stock outperformed most of its competitors as stocks in the S P 500 Index overall had an average return of 28  over the trailing 12 months 
The stock has popped early this year  up about 6  already year to date  What has driven its success  and can it sustain its edge 
T  Rowe Price looks to benefit from a SECURE future
The Baltimore based money manager has  1 126 trillion in assets under management  AUM  as of its last earnings report  Roughly  643 billion of that is in mutual funds  with  146 billion in fixed income assets and  336 billion in multi asset funds  which include target date retirement products  AUM climbed about 4  year over year in the third quarter last year  The asset growth came mostly from the multi asset retirement funds  which saw modest inflows and an asset increase of  3 7 billion in the quarter 

T  Rowe Price should benefit from the passage of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act  or the SECURE Act  which was approved by Congress late last year  The SECURE Act will expand access to 401 k  plans by allowing small employers to create multi employer plans and allowing part time workers to participate in retirement plans  among other provisions 
This should lead to more contributions and more assets in more plans  which is good for firms like T  Rowe Price  which is strong in the retirement market  Recently  the company has opened up new distribution channels for its retirement funds through Envestnet  NYSE ENV  and Morningstar  NASDAQ MORN  
Solid fundamentals form T  Rowe Price s performance basis
T  Rowe Price s performance is rooted in solid fundamentals  It has no long term debt and generates steady revenue growth  Net revenues jumped to  1 4 billion in the third quarter  up 2 3  year over year  while net income increased 3 9  to  659 million  It also has ample liquidity  which enables it to strategically deploy capital in growth opportunities  like its recent investment in electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian 
This also gives it money to spend on new products  like its line of actively managed ETFs that it is launching this year   Passively managed  index based strategies have fueled the growth of ETFs thus far   Tim Coyne  head of ETFs at T  Rowe Price  said   But we believe that semi transparent  actively managed ETFs from a trusted brand like T  Rowe Price have the potential to gain traction with investors and advisors who are already interested in active management but who might prefer the ETF structure  We believe this is a significant milestone that will lead to opening a new avenue for our business  
Steady  long term dividend growth
The company s stability can be measured by its stellar history of delivering dividends  The company has not reduced its quarterly dividend for 32 straight years  It currently pays out  0 76 per quarter per share  which comes out to  3 04 annually per share  Since Dec  31  2009  it s gone up  0 51 a share  and over the past five years it has increased  0 32 a share  It pays a yield of 2 3  per year with a payout ratio of 38  
With a price to earnings ratio of 16 52  the stock is attractively priced and  with its strong fundamentals and solid balance sheet  it should continue to generate earnings growth and outperform ",2020-01-18,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjqkn,2062634

145604,367119,TROW,T  Rowe Price s McPherson sees green light for value stocks,news,"By April Joyner and Ross Kerber
NEW YORK  Reuters    Economic uncertainty has held back value stocks  but fund manager Heather McPherson of T  Rowe Price Group Inc  O TROW  sees plenty of opportunity to scoop up undervalued shares  including in the financial and utilities sectors 
Among her picks are American International Group Inc  N AIG    Wells Fargo    Co  N WFC  and CenterPoint Energy Inc  N CNP   she said on Thursday at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit in New York 
Shares of AIG  along with other property and casualty insurance companies  are poised to rise as concerns related to climate change and litigation drive up pricing  McPherson said  She cited California wildfires and opioid lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies as among events boosting insurers  pricing power 
 We re seeing the best pricing that we ve seen in 15 years   she said 
McPherson manages T  Rowe s  750 million U S  Large Cap Value Equity Fund and helps run a  22 billion strategy with a similar mandate for institutional investors 
 For other news from the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit  click on  
At a time when net deposits in the mutual funds industry have shifted strongly to passive index products with low fees  McPherson takes a traditional approach  looking for undervalued companies 
Though some of her holdings have underperformed  she sees the tide turning as the industrial sector of the U S  economy improves and the Federal Reserve s monetary policy remains accommodative 
 It feels a little bit different here   she said   In the mix of that  though  is a lot of regulatory and political uncertainty  which we re trying to use as an opportunity to buy good companies  
For McPherson  one such bet is Wells Fargo  the top holding in her fund as of Sept  30  She said the San Francisco based bank is well positioned to finally move beyond a sales practices scandal 
Shares of Wells Fargo were at  54 20 in afternoon trading on Thursday  below the  65 range they reached in early 2018 but above their close of  43 38 on Aug  15  before Chief Executive Charlie Scharf took over 
The shares represent  one of the best risk rewards in this space  We think they are coming out of the penalty box   McPherson said 
Another position in McPherson s fund is utility CenterPoint Energy Inc  N CNP  of Houston  Its shares are lower than they were on Feb  1 when it completed its merger with Indiana based Vectren Corp 
The deal should help CenterPoint because it will increase the share of its operations focused on power generation  and reduce the impact of its stake in a pipeline company that has turned off investors  she said 
 We re trying to find these idiosyncratic ideas that look cheap   she said ",2019-11-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/t-rowe-prices-mcpherson-sees-green-light-for-value-stocks-2015165,2015165
145605,367120,TROW,5 Of The Best Stocks With Stellar Relative Price Strength,opinion,Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average Upon such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our

Forget Coronavirus  5 Must Buy Nasdaq Stocks to Tap RallyWall Street s fabulous rally came to a halt in January owing to the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus in China and its potential impact on global economic recovery  Wall Street s two major stock indexes   the Dow and the S P 500 ended the last month in the red However  the third major index   the Nasdaq Composite   witnessed impressive gain in January and has recorded a fresh closing high on Feb 4 as U S  stock markets recovered from last week s coronavirus led pullback Nasdaq Composite Continues Dream RunThe Nasdaq Composite commenced 2020 right from where it left off last year  Notably  the tech laden index rallied an impressive 35 2  in 2019  marking its best yearly performance in six years  The index followed it up with a 2  gain in January 2020 despite facing severe market volatility thanks to the coronavirus outbreak While Nasdaq plunged 1 6  on Jan 31  it recovered more than that gaining 1 3  and 2 1   respectively  in the first two trading days of February  Notably  on Feb 4  the tech heavy index closed at a fresh all time high of 9 467 97  its first closing above 9 400  The Nasdaq Composite is up 5 5  year to date Strong U S  Economic DataA series of impressive economic data for the month of December and January reaffirms U S  economic stability and clearly indicates that the expansionary phase is here to stay  Notably  the U S  economy is expanding for the last 11 5 years   the longest expansion historically The U S  GDP grew at 2 3  rate in 2019  buoyed by strong consumer spending  which constitutes more than 70  of the economy  Additionally  a solid labor market and gradual wage growth offset the drop in business spending and manufacturing activities Strong retail sales and factory data for December confirms improvement in both consumer and business spending  Notably  recovery of the housing market in 2019 was a major positive for the U S  economy as the sector constitutes nearly 3 1  of GDP The ISM reported that the U S  manufacturing index in January came in at 50 9  its highest and first expansion since July 2019  Any reading above 50 equates to expansion of U S  manufacturing activities  Moreover  the conference board reported that consumer confidence index for the month of January came in at 131 6   the highest since August 2019 Finally  on Jan 15  the United States and China signed a temporary trade deal popularly known as the phase one trade deal  Although a complete deal is not likely to be signed before the U S  presidential election this November  the interim deal will at least help in restoring U S  business confidence and global economic growth Invest in Stocks with Solid MomentumMomentum investing calls for a continuous appraisal

145634,367149,TROW,Special Report  Fidelity puts 6 million savers on risky path to retirement,news,"By Tim McLaughlin and Renee Dudley
BOSTON  Reuters    For three years  the mutual funds in Fidelity s flagship retirement franchise have outperformed at least 85 percent of their competitors  reversing a decade long trend of subpar performance 
And yet client money has continued to flow out of the firm s Freedom Funds as retirement plan sponsors shift workers  savings to rivals in the target date fund business 
While deposits in the trillion dollar sector have surged  Fidelity has seen nearly  16 billion in net withdrawals over the past four years  according to research firm Morningstar Inc 
The exodus stems in part from unease with the way Boston based Fidelity has boosted performance   by ramping up risk 
Since a strategy overhaul that took full effect in 2014  Fidelity has substantially increased exposure to stocks  including those from volatile emerging markets  The firm also scrapped a long held belief of sticking to pre set allocations of stocks  bonds and other assets in target date funds 
Instead  Fidelity portfolio managers now try to time market shifts  for instance by moving billions of dollars out of money losing commodities bets and into Chinese stocks and U S  tech shares  regulatory filings show 
Such changes have worked well in the second longest running bull market in U S  history  but they expose investors to bigger losses if the funds  increasingly volatile assets head south 
In the 1990s  Fidelity helped pioneer target date funds as a prudent method to diversify investments and automatically dial down risk as participants age  The fund names typically include a projected retirement year   the target date 
Today  many target date fund managers have turned to riskier investments to boost returns  and Fidelity has gone further than its peers  said Ron Surz  president of research firm Target Date Solutions 
 These funds with high concentrations in stocks are a time bomb   Surz said 
The sector is even riskier today than during the 2008 financial crisis  when some funds dropped more than 40 percent  he said 
Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio said today s American savers can handle more risk because they retire later and live longer  allowing more time to recover losses 
 The Freedom Funds are a lifetime savings solution   he said  that  deliver exceptional performance for shareholders taking appropriate risks  
A recent global market sell off underscored how Fidelity s growing appetite for risk could amplify investor losses 
The Freedom 2020 Fund  O FFFDX    for investors two years from retirement   fell 6 percent between Jan  26th and Feb  8th  performing worse than 81 percent of competitors  similar target date funds  according to Morningstar 
The sharp downturn reflects Fidelity s decision to keep 60 percent of 2020 investors  money in stocks compared to an average of 40 percent in similar funds for older savers  according to Morningstar 
The 2040 fund  O FFFFX   for mid career savers  tumbled 9 percent during that period  lagging 87 percent of rivals  after outperforming almost all competitors over the past year as stocks generally surged  The 2060 fund  O FDKVX  for young investors did better  beating 60 percent of rivals during the market sell off 
Loporchio said such short term swings do not reflect what Fidelity s retirement savers will see over the long term  With its 2014 strategy changes  Fidelity needed to address a longstanding problem with underperformance of Freedom Funds  Loporchio said 
 When Fidelity products yield disappointing returns  we work relentlessly to improve them   he said 
In the decade before the changes  Freedom Funds largely failed to beat or match their internal benchmarks  set by Fidelity  over one   three   five  and 10 year spans  according to a Reuters analysis of the firm s performance data  Had the funds been a sports team  their record against benchmarks would have been six wins  40 losses and one tie 
 For a graphic detailing Fidelity s falling market share and historic underperformance  see    
About 6 2 million Americans have about  224 billion invested in Freedom Funds  Fidelity s largest retirement fund franchise  The funds account for about 10 percent of the firm s assets under management and generate fee revenue approaching  1 billion annually 
But the funds  market share has plunged to 21 percent of total target date fund assets  down from 43 percent at the end of 2008  according to Morningstar Inc data 
Of the top five target date providers  Fidelity was the only one to have net withdrawals in 2016 and 2017  according to Morningstar data  By contrast  the target date industry as a whole racked up  129 billion in net deposits during those two years 
 CHAOTIC  CHANGES
Retirement plan sponsors and consultants who have pulled money from Freedom Funds told Reuters that they lost faith in Freedom Funds because of their history of underperformance  frequent strategy changes and rising risk 
Dassault Systemes  a French software company with U S  operations  is among those who dumped Freedom Fund investments soon after the strategy revamp  Fidelity s  tinkering  with the funds  methodology for dialing down investor risk over time raised concerns about the funds  management  said Longfellow Advisors  an outside consultant hired by Dassault  in a report to the company 
 It was not clear to us that they knew what they were doing   Kendall Storch  a Longfellow principal who consulted Dassault on the change  told Reuters in an interview 
Plan sponsors dumping Freedom Funds more recently include a host of college retirement systems that shifted money in 2017 to target date funds offered by Vanguard  according to announcements by the plans  They included Central Florida University  Dartmouth College  Duke University  Santa Clara University and the University of Virginia Physicians Group Retirement Plan 
El Camino Hospital in Silicon Valley replaced Freedom Funds with T  Rowe Price s target date offering in 2015  citing historic underperformance and the new  attempt to time global markets   according to a February 2015 investment committee meeting report 
 Fidelity has made a lot of changes all at once   said Scott Cameron  chief investment officer at retirement consultant Multnomah Group  which advised El Camino Hospital on the change   It does cause clients to pause  
It s not the first time Fidelity has been criticized for strategy changes that unsettled investors and analysts  When Morningstar looked at Fidelity s changes in the allocation of stocks between 1996 and 2010  they described them as  shocking  and  seemingly chaotic   according to a 2011 Morningstar report on the target date fund industry 
Fidelity said its new market timing strategy  which it calls  active asset allocation   can capitalize on finding underpriced assets over a 1 to 5 year time horizon  Since 2014  Freedom Fund portfolio managers have had discretion to adjust allocations in major asset classes by up to 10 percentage points in either direction 
Loporchio said that the investment management for a target date fund  should be flexible and adaptable  to evolve and respond to changes in both the capital markets and investor needs  
TRYING TO  NOT LOSE MONEY 
Fidelity has historically frowned on market timing strategies in retirement funds  saying they had a  low probability of repeated success   according to a 2009 presentation Fidelity gave to the Vermont state and municipal retirement system  Reuters obtained the slide deck through a public records request 
Instead  Fidelity restricted Freedom Fund managers to pre determined asset allocation formulas  with specified percentages of stocks  bonds or other assets 
The Freedom Funds  launched in 1996  dominated the sector for years  As the top U S  record keeper for 401 k  and other defined contribution retirement plans  Fidelity had outsized influence on what investment options were offered to workers at hospitals  municipalities  publicly traded companies and universities 
But the funds lost ground in the mid 2000s as rival Vanguard Group overtook them with its cheaper index target date funds 
Until the changes in 2014  Fidelity funds held higher concentrations of more conservative investments such as bonds  aimed at protecting investors against the downside risk of market cataclysms 
Even with a more conservative asset mix than Freedom Funds have today  Fidelity struggled to control the damage from the 2008 financial crisis  when the funds performed as poorly as the rest of the sector  losing 41 percent for the youngest savers and 25 percent for those near retirement 
This time around  Freedom Funds are more exposed to equities and other higher risk assets  according to analysts and a Reuters review of Fidelity s U S  regulatory filings 
And the stakes are much higher now  The popular target date fund sector now has more than  1 trillion in assets under management   or more than five times as much as before the 2008 meltdown 
Despite Fidelity s rapid loss of market share  Freedom Fund assets have more than doubled in the past decade as the stock values surged 
Fidelity has gone further than competitors in boosting risk to juice returns in a low interest rate environment  fund disclosures show 
For example  Fidelity s Freedom 2020 Fund   marketing to people retiring in about two years   has 60 percent of its assets in equities 
By contrast  2020 funds run by T  Rowe Price Group Inc  O TROW   Vanguard Group and American Funds have 58 5 percent  55 percent and 49 percent  respectively  in equities  fund holding disclosures show 
Fidelity s 2020 fund includes 6 4 percent of its  31 billion in net assets in emerging market equities  such as Chinese stocks  according to company disclosures  That s up from about 1 percent a decade ago in an similar Fidelity fund for older savers  according to a returns based estimates by software and research firm Markov Processes International Inc 
The current exposure is significantly higher than the category average of about 4 percent in 2020 funds  according to MPI s analysis 
Emerging markets  in particular  can be more volatile than the U S  stock market because they can feature foreign currency exchange risk  political instability and limited liquidity  In the summer of 2015  for example  the Shanghai Composite Index  SSEC  fell more than 40 percent in a sell off that reverberated around the globe amid worries about China s slowing economy 
Freedom Fund portfolio managers and quants are experimenting with artificial intelligence and algorithms similar to ones used by hedge funds to identify hidden shifts in the market to adjust investment allocations  according to Fidelity s published research 
The changes have paid off in the short run  with Freedom Funds  1 year and 3 year returns beating internal benchmarks  Fidelity also credited junk bonds for helping bolster returns  according to portfolio manager commentary posted on its website 
In the long run  the biggest risk in target date funds is that they won t meet investor expectations for avoiding losses  said Morningstar analyst Jeff Holt 
The funds  he said  are so popular in part because investors believe they are designed to  not lose money  ",2018-03-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/special-report-fidelity-puts-6-million-savers-on-risky-path-to-retirement-1324392,1324392

145661,367176,TROW,Legg Mason s  LM  Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates  Revenues Down,opinion,Legg Mason Inc    NYSE LM   reported positive earnings surprise of 10 5  in second quarter fiscal 2020  ended Sep 30   The company recorded adjusted net income of 95 cents per share  outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents  Further  the reported figure escalated 17 3  year over year Higher assets under management  AUM  drove the company s performance  In addition  controlled expenses were a tailwind  Nonetheless  fall in revenues  resulting from lower investment advisory fees  was a major drag in the quarter Including certain one time items  Legg Mason reported net income of  67 1 million or 74 cents per share compared with the net income of  72 8 million or 82 cents recorded in the year ago quarter Revenues Decline  Expenses DropLegg Mason s total adjusted operating revenues in the reported quarter came in at  617 3 million  slightly down year over year  The fall mainly resulted from decreased distribution and service fees  reduced average fund AUM earning distribution fee revenue and lower advisory fee revenues  These decreases were partially offset by increased non pass through performance fees  However  the revenue figure outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  732 million Investment advisory fees slipped slightly year over year to  675 1 million in the quarter  Distribution and service fees were down 15 2  year over year to  67 1 million  Also  other revenues slumped 45  year over year to  1 1 million Operating expenses edged down 1  to  618 3 million on a year over year basis  This downside chiefly resulted from lower distribution and other costs  partly offset by higher compensation and benefits Non operating expense was  19 7 million  down 20 6  year over year Adjusted operating margin of Legg Mason was 25  in the September end quarter  up from the 24 5  recorded in the prior year quarter Assets PositionAs of Sep 30  2019  Legg Mason s AUM was  781 8 billion  up 3 5  year over year from  755 4 billion  Of the total AUM  fixed income constituted 57   equity 26   liquidity 8  and alternatives represented 9  Also  AUM ascended slightly on a sequential basis from the  780 2 billion as of Jun 30  2019  driven by an encouraging market performance and other of  8 7 billion  These were partly countered by negative foreign exchange of  3 2 billion  long term outflows of  0 2 billion  liquidity outflows of  3 5 billion and  0 2 billion in realizations Notably  long term flows included equity outflows of  2 1 billion and fixed income outflows of  0 5 billion  partly offset by alternative inflows of  2 4 billion Additionally  average AUM was  779 8 billion compared with the  750 2 billion witnessed in the year earlier quarter and

145730,367245,TROW,5 Stocks With Attractive Sales Growth Worth Buying Right Now,opinion,Stable sales growth is the key to survival in today s fast changing and highly competitive operating backdrop  So  superior revenues are vital for healthy business growth  Most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise Revenues are income generated by a company through business activities  Though a company might not be profitable over a particular period  it usually generates revenues unless there are unforeseen situations In cases when companies tend to incur loss on a temporary basis  these are valued based on revenues and not earnings  This is because sales growth  or decline  is usually an early indicator of the company s future earnings performance While sales growth is an important metric for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision making  this in isolation does not reflect much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits Therefore  consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and further potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Picking the Potential Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy P S Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 24 stocks that qualified the screening     AMETEK  Inc    NYSE AME   manufactures and sells electronic instruments

145744,367259,TROW,Legg Mason s  LM  Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates  Costs Down,opinion,Legg Mason Inc    NYSE LM   reported positive earnings surprise of 4 17  in first quarter fiscal 2020  ended Jun 30   The company reported adjusted net income of 75 cents per share  outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents  However  the reported figure declined 6 3  year over year Higher assets under management  AUM  drove the company s performance  Further  controlled expenses were a tailwind  Nonetheless  fall in revenues  resulting from lower investment advisory fees  was a major drag in the quarter Including certain one time items  Legg Mason reported net income of  45 4 million or 51 cents per share compared with net income of  66 1 million or 75 cents recorded in the year ago quarter Revenues Decline  Expenses DropLegg Mason s total adjusted operating revenues in the reported quarter came in at  705 4 million  down 6  year over year  The fall mainly resulted from both lower non pass and pass through performance fees  along with lower fund advisory fee revenues  In addition  the revenue figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  708 million Investment advisory fees slipped 5  year over year to  634 1 million in the quarter  Distribution and service fees were down 11 7  year over year to  69 9 million  However  other revenues increased 8 3  year over year to  1 3 million Operating expenses declined slightly to  621 4 million on a year over year basis  This downside chiefly resulted from lower compensation and benefits  distribution and other costs Non operating expense was  4 3 million  significantly down year over year Adjusted operating margin of Legg Mason was 21 6  in the June end quarter  down from the 23  recorded in the prior year quarter Assets PositionAs of Jun 30  2019  Legg Mason s AUM was  780 2 billion  up 4 8  year over year from  744 6 billion  Of the total AUM  fixed income constituted 56   equity 26   liquidity 9  and alternatives represented 9  Also  AUM ascended 2 9  sequentially from the  758 billion as of Mar 31  2019  driven by an encouraging market performance and other of  21 9 billion  along with positive foreign exchange of  0 6 billion  acquired AUM of  0 6 billion and long term inflows of  1 1 billion  These were partly countered by liquidity outflows of  1 6 billion and  0 4 billion in realizations Notably  long term flows included equity outflows of  3 6 billion  offset by fixed income inflows of  3 9 billion and alternative inflows of  0 8 billion Additionally  average AUM was  765 9 billion compared with  749 5 billion witnessed in the year earlier quarter and  748 7 billion in the previous quarter Strong Balance SheetAs of Jun 30  2019  Legg Mason had  643 6 million in cash  Total debt was  2 2 billion  Shareholders  equity came in at  3 7 billion The ratio of total debt to total capital  total equity plus total debt excluding consolidated investment vehicles  was 38   in line with the previous quarter Our ViewpointWe believe Legg Mason has the potential to outperform its peers over the long run  given the company s diversified product mix and leverage in the changing market demography  In addition to these  with strategic acquisitions  restructuring initiatives and cost cutting measures  we anticipate the company s operating efficiencies to improve Though declining revenues is a key concern  prudent expense management and higher AUM remain driving factors  Legg Mason  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Legg Mason currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

145758,367273,TROW,Muted Lending  High Costs To Mar KeyCorp  KEY  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,KeyCorp   NYSE KEY   is scheduled to report second quarter 2019 results on Jul 23  before the opening bell  The quarter did not witness significant improvement in the lending scenario  particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial  which account for nearly 50  of KeyCorp s average loan balances In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s average total loans and average interest earning assets show that these are likely to rise modestly in the to be reported quarter  The consensus estimate for average total loans of  90 5 billion indicates growth of nearly 1  from the previous quarter s reported figure Also  the consensus estimate for average interest earning assets of  127 8 billion suggests marginal rise on a sequential basis Thus  given soft loan growth  flattening of the yield curve and steadily rising deposit betas  the company s net interest income  NII  growth is expected to remain moderate in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII  tax equivalent basis  for the second quarter is pegged at  999 million  indicating a rise of 1 4  from the prior quarter Now  let s check out the other main factors that are likely to influence KeyCorp s second quarter performance Non interest income to remain relatively stable  Decent equity markets performance and the central banks  dovish stance seem to have supported equity issuance across the globe in the second quarter  However  fears of economic slowdown somewhat weighed on companies  plans to raise fresh capital by issuing shares  Additionally  relatively higher rates and several geopolitical concerns adversely impacted debt issuances in the to be reported quarter  These are likely to have hurt KeyCorp s investment banking performance Moreover  while dealmakers across the globe were active during the second quarter  global deal value and volume declined due to higher borrowing costs  Thus  the company s advisory fees are likely to be negatively impacted  Nonetheless  the strong M A deal pipeline from the previous quarters will offer some respite Nevertheless  mortgage banking fees are projected to improve due to an expected increase in refinancing activities  mainly driven by lower mortgage rates  seasonality and the Federal Reserve s accommodative stance Expenses might not provide much support  While KeyCorp s efforts to diversify products  reorganize operations and exit unprofitable non core businesses have helped in saving costs  its continued investments in franchise and inorganic growth strategies are expected to lead to rise in overall expenses Asset quality to offer some support  The consensus estimate for non performing assets of  583 million indicates a 2 3  decline from the previous quarter s reported figure  Likewise  the estimate for non performing loans of  541 million suggests a 1 3  decrease from the prior quarter s reported figure Here is what our quantitative model predicts Chances of KeyCorp beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are low  This is because it doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP

145778,367293,TROW,Low Rates  Muted Lending To Hurt BNY Mellon s  BK  Q2 Earnings,opinion,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation   NYSE BK   is scheduled to report second quarter 2019 results on Jul 17  before the market opens  Its revenues and earnings for the to be reported quarter are expected to decline year over year In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Decline in revenues along with lower assets under management  AUM  hurt results  However  fall in expenses was a positive Nevertheless  BNY Mellon has a decent earnings surprise history  Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two and matched in one of the trailing four quarters  The average positive surprise was 1 9  The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Activities of the company in the second quarter were not adequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 94 cents declined 2 1  over the past 30 days  Moreover  it indicates a decline of 8 7  from the year ago reported number Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to be reported quarter is pegged at  3 91 billion  indicating a decline of 5 3  from the previous year quarter s reported figure Looking at BNY Mellon s price performance  its shares have lost 13 6  in the past six months against 6 2  growth recorded by the  it belongs to Will the price performance improve post second quarter earnings  To a great extent  it depends on whether the company will be able to beat earnings estimates this time around Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts  let s check the factors that are likely to impact second quarter results Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AUM for the second quarter is pegged at  1 88 trillion  which indicates growth of 2 2  from the previous quarter s reported figure  Further  the consensus estimate for total assets under custody and administration of  35 32 trillion suggests growth of 2 4  from the prior quarter  Thus  driven by expected growth in assets  investment management and performance fee is likely to be positively impacted in the second quarter The consensus estimate for total investment services fee indicates that this component is also likely to increase in the quarter  The consensus estimate for the same is pegged at  1 95 billion  which suggests growth of 2 4  from the previous quarter s reported number Thus  supported by growth in the two most important components of fee revenues  it is expected that total fee revenues will increase  The consensus estimate for fee revenues for the second quarter is pegged at  3 10 billion  suggesting growth of 2 3  from the prior quarter s reported figure However  the lending scenario has not been great in the second quarter  Thus  dismal loan growth along with the central bank s accommodative stance and flattening of the yield curve will likely hurt BNY Mellon s net interest revenue  NIR  growth Notably  management expects NIR in the second quarter to decline nearly 3 5  sequentially  This is based on expectations of a decrease in non interest bearing deposit balances and relatively flat yield on the securities portfolio Despite taking cost saving initiatives  the company s expenses have remained elevated over the past few years mainly because of higher litigation and restructuring charges  Moreover  due to continued rise in investment related costs  overall expenses are expected to increase slightly in the to be reported quarter Now  let s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts According to our quantitative model  it cannot be conclusively predicted whether BNY Mellon will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter  This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   which is required to

145861,367376,TROW,Bet On Emerging Markets With These 6 Great Stocks ,opinion,Emerging market investments suffered in 2018 following worries over trade conflict and global growth  This is why the MSCI Emerging Markets Index shed nearly 25  of its value between Jan 29 and Oct 29  A recovery of sorts followed during the last two months of the year  but the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  NYSE EEM  has still lost more than 18  year to date The category has rebounded this year  with the EEM up 8 6  year to date  In contrast  the S P 500 is up 10 9  over the same period  Does this mean that market watchers critical of investing in emerging markets are correct  In reality  there are several compelling reasons to invest in the category at this point  This is why it would make good sense to pick up select emerging market stocks Great Defensive Play  Valuations AttractiveAt first glance  this argument looks fallacious  but historical trends  when looked at closely  suggest otherwise  According to Jim Paulsen of the Leuthold Group  emerging market stocks have consistently beaten their developed counterparts during the last years of the market and economic cycles  Paulsen was referring specifically to the three bull markets since the mid 1990s Further  according to Charles Shriver of T  Rowe Price   NASDAQ TROW    emerging market stocks are significantly cheaper than their U S  counterparts  While the S P 500 currently has a forward price to earnings ratio  the metric stands at 12 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index Shriver also points that it is cheaper when considering historical trends since its current price to book ratio is 1 64  The stock has traded above this level for more than 60  of the time during the last 15 years      Faster Economic Growth  Dovish Fed Boost ProspectsAccording to economists from Deutsche Bank   NYSE DB    GDP growth for emerging markets as a whole will come in around 4 6  this year  This compares favorably to expectations of 2 5  for the United States and 3 5  for the global economy as a whole Further  analysts at Franklin Templeton think emerging markets will regain their earnings growth momentum in 2019 following the slowdown encountered last year  The Fed s new found dovishness will also play its part in raising the attractiveness of emerging markets A softer approach from the Fed will weaken the dollar  benefiting emerging market stocks in the process  This is because emerging markets typically export commodities  whose price goes up when the dollar starts to decline And in case the United States and China are able to settle their trade dispute  emerging markets will move even higher  The jury is out on whether Trump will receive all the concessions he is demanding  But market watchers largely feel that a deal will be struck soon since it is the best outcome for both parties Our ChoicesMarket watchers and experts feel that emerging market stocks could strongly rebound this year  Attractive valuations and faster economic growth are just some of the factors working in their favor  At the same time  they make for great defensive plays and will benefit from a dovish Federal Reserve Adding emerging market stocks to your portfolio looks prudent  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score China Southern  NYSE SO  Airlines

Both revenues and earnings are anticipated to grow year over year  with likely earnings beat on the cards Before we discuss why an earnings beat is likely and what could influence the results  let s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter    Driven by higher revenues and lower provisions  People s United reported a positive earnings surprise of 4  in third quarter 2017  Further  elevated loans and deposits balances were tailwinds  However  escalating expenses was the undermining factor Notably  People s United delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the four trailing quarters  with an average beat of 2 09   People s United Financial  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Regarding the stock s performance  shares of the company have gained around 3 1  for the three month period ended Dec 31  2017  outperforming growth of 2 6  recorded by the  Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People s United s stock  This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the fourth quarter  Notably  our quantitative model predicts a likely earnings beat this time  Here s why Our proven model indicates that chances of People s United beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is currently pegged at  0 61   This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company Zacks Rank  The combination of People s United s Zacks Rank  2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter remained unchanged over the last seven days and is expected to move up 12 5  year over year  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at  392 7 million  up 18 6  year over year Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsLoan Growth  Per the Federal Reserve s latest data  loans declined on a sequential basis during the December end quarter  Particularly  growth in consumer loans  with slowdown in real estate loans  along with commercial and industrial  C I  loans  is expected  Therefore  interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally In addition  management s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter  Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 11 13  Modest Rise in Net Interest Income  NII   Given the influence of rise in interest rates  People s United is anticipated to have recorded an increase in NII  Notably  management s projections of 2017 NII to grow in the range of 12 14  is likely to show impact in the quarter to be reported as well Fee Income to Escalate  On strong retail banking  fee income might escalate for the bank  Additionally  the company projects non interest income to rise in the range of 5 7  in 2017  the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the to be reported quarter Increase in Expenses  Despite undertaking a number of expense saving initiatives  People s United s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level  Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs  escalating expense levels are likely to limit bottom line expansion Adverse impact of new tax code  The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one time bonus payments  higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings  Also  though the company has not provided any information about the write down of deferred tax assets  DTAs   it might record a significant one time charge in the fourth quarter Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider  as according to our model  these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter The

146105,367620,TROW,What s In Store For Regions  RF  Stock This Earnings Season ,opinion,Regions Financial Corporation   NYSE RF   is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 results tomorrow  before the opening bell  While revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year  we can t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results  let s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter    This Birmingham  AL based company s second quarter 2017 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to impressive growth in revenues aided by easing margin pressure  Further  the company recorded growth in loans  though deposits balance remained stable  Credit quality metrics also improved  Rise in adjusted operating expenses and decline in non interest income were the undermining factors Notably  this upbeat performance resulted in an appreciation of the company s share price  For the three month period ended Sep 30  2017  the stock gained around 4  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 25 cents over the last 30 days  reflecting a year over year improvement of 5 3   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of  1 45 billion indicates around 1  growth from the prior year quarter In addition  Regions is projected to record slight decline on a sequential basis in average interest earning assets as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is  109 7 billion Regions has an impressive earnings surprise history  as evident from the chart below  Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Regions  stock  This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the third quarter  However  our quantitative model doesn t conclusively point toward a likely earnings beat this time  Here s why Regions doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold    for increasing its chances of an earnings beat Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Regions is  0 48   This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Regions  Zacks Rank  4 decreases the predictive power of ESP It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsLoan Growth  Per the Federal Reserve s latest data  loans grew on a sequential basis during the third quarter  Improvement in loan demand  particularly commercial and industrial  and consumer loans during the to be reported quarter are anticipated to support the company s net interest income In addition  management s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter  The bank projects average loans to be flat to marginally down on a year over year basis  excluding the impact of the third party indirect vehicle portfolio  Average deposits are estimated to be relatively stable compared to the prior year Modest Rise in Net Interest Income  NII   Given the effect of rise in interest rates  Regions should have recorded an increase in NII  Notably  management s projections of the 2017 NII and other financing income to grow in the range of 3 5  are likely to show impact in the third quarter as well Non Interest Income Might Escalate  The persistent decline in non interest income has weighed on the top line for the last few years  Nevertheless  adjusted non interest income is estimated to grow 1 3   Management expects a pick up in capital markets revenues  along with modest growth in wealth management  mortgage and card  and ATM fees to contribute to overall growth in

146277,367792,TROW,BEN  A Possible Dividend Growth Bargain,opinion,"Franklin Resources  N BEN  increased its dividend by a hefty 20  last week  continuing its dividend growth streak dating back to 1981 
This dividend aristocrat has recently fallen on hard times  causing its stock price to drop by 37  over the last year  BEN s stock now has a dividend yield twice as high as its five year average yield  and it trades for a forward earnings multiple of just 12 6x 
Let s take a closer look at the business  which has several notable strengths despite the fall in its stock price Business OverviewFranklin Resources is a global investment management firm with more than  725 billion in assets under management as of 1 31 16  It provides equity  fixed income  alternative  and custom solutions to a mix of retail  76  of assets  and institutional  24   clients located in over 180 countries  Some of its largest funds include the Templeton Global Bond Fund  N GIM  and the Franklin Income Fund 
Most of its products are open end mutual funds  and the company primarily makes money by charging a fee based on a percentage of the total market value of the assets it manages 
By asset type  approximately 40  of the company s assets under management are in equity products  42  in fixed income  and 18  in hybrid investments  Franklin Resources  U S  funds accounted for roughly 67  of its assets in fiscal year 2015 Business AnalysisAs one of the largest investment managers in the world and with an operating history dating back more than 65 years  Franklin Resources has built up significant brand value in the industry  The company has been partnering with financial advisors and brokers for distribution of its products since the late 1940s  resulting in thousands of long lasting relationships that are advocates of its funds 
The majority of Franklin Resources  funds have also ranked in the top half of their peer groups over the last 3   5   and 10 year periods  helping the company significantly expand its asset base over time  The firm has a particularly strong track record in the fixed income business and is also well diversified by product type and geography  adding to its moat and durability 
As one of the largest players in the industry  Franklin Resources is also able to spread its costs over a larger pool of clients to keep its costs competitive and gain economies of scale  The asset management business mostly requires people and computers  which further boosts the company s cash flows given the little amount of capital required to run the business 
Asset managers also benefit from recurring revenue and the long term trajectory of financial markets  Clients pay asset managers a fee each year to invest their money  and most will stay with a fund manager for multiple years  Many retail investors will even set an asset allocation plan and never touch it  giving companies such as Franklin Resources a long stream of revenue 
Furthermore  clients pay more fees as the value of their accounts rises  Financial markets increase in value over long periods of time  providing free growth for asset managers as long as their performance is  good enough  to retain existing clients Franklin Resources  Key RisksInvestment managers live and die on performance and brand reputation  Unfortunately for Franklin Resources  the performance of some of its largest funds has lagged most peers  results in recent years  leading to outflows 
As a result  the company s total assets under management have declined from  872 billion in January 2015 to  728 billion as of the end of January 2016  a decline of 17  
Poor performing asset managers  especially those with relatively high management fees  are seeing clients leave in favor of low cost exchange traded funds  ETFs  that simply try to match the market s returns 
We think this is a real threat that will continue pressuring management fees lower and forcing smaller managers to consolidate in response  Franklin Resources is somewhat better positioned than its peers because of its economies of scale and product diversification  but it only has one ETF offering today 
The company recently hired a new head of global ETFs and will soon be launching a group of strategic beta ETFs  but the firm is certainly late to the party  However  Franklin Resources has over  8 billion in cash on the balance sheet it can use on acquisitions to gain exposure to areas of growth within asset management 
How ETFs can complement existing active funds is still being figured out  but it s clearly becoming an increasingly important topic for mutual funds to figure out 
In addition to fee pressure and client redemptions in response to poor performance and the rise of passive investment products  the company s near term results are subject to market risk  Many of the firm s funds have found themselves exposed to sour macro bets such as energy  distressed debt  and Ukraine 
If financial markets were to drop further  BEN s stock would likely fall disproportionately lower  The strong dollar is also weighing on the company s reported results since over 30  of its assets are international Dividend Analysis  Franklin ResourcesWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Franklin Resources  Dividend Safety Score is 86  which suggests that its dividend payment is safer than most stocks in the market  Even despite the company s recent weak results  sales were down 15  last quarter   its payout ratios over the trailing 12 months are a very healthy 20   As seen below  the company s payout ratio has been in the teens most years it did not pay a special dividend  A low payout ratio gives Franklin Resources  dividend plenty of cushion and room for growth Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Unlike some recession resistant dividend stocks  Franklin Resources does not fare well during times of crisis  When the economy weakens  financial markets are often hit hard  This reduces the market value of Franklin Resources  assets under management and often results in clients pulling out their money in a flight to safety  As seen below  the company s sales fell by 30  during the financial crisis  BEN s stock also dropped by 44  in 2008  highlighting the heightened sensitivity that asset managers have to broader financial markets Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Franklin Resources  dividend safety is also helped by the company s dependable free cash flow generation  The asset management business does not require much capital to operate and is very scalable as more assets come in the door  throwing off significant cash flow Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Most blue chip dividend stocks have competitive advantages that enable them to earn high returns on their invested capital  We can see that Franklin Resources has generated a mid teens return on invested capital most years over the last decade  highlighting the strong profitability of large asset managers Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Franklin Resources also has a pristine balance sheet with over  8 2 billion in cash compared to  2 4 billion in debt  The company s cash easily covers the total dividends it paid last fiscal year   666 million  and allows the company to consistently repurchase its shares  which have declined by roughly 2  per year Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Franklin Resources  dividend is extremely safe  The company has very low payout ratios  generates reliable free cash flow  and has a large chunk of cash on its balance sheet  Even if the market declines substantially  BEN s dividend should remain very secure Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Franklin Resources has grown its dividend by 16  per year over the last decade and by 23  per year over the last three years  It has also rewarded shareholders with special dividends in 2014  2012  2011  and 2009 
The company has an above average Dividend Growth Score of 63  reflecting its 20  payout ratio  excess cash on the balance sheet  and proven commitment to shareholders  Franklin Resources most recently increased its dividend by 20  and has raised its dividend for over 30 consecutive years  We expect double digit dividend growth to continue ValuationBEN s stock trades at 12 6x forward earnings estimates and has a dividend yield of 2 1   which is roughly twice as high as its five year average dividend yield of 1  
Over the last decade  the company s operating income has increased at a 4 8  compound annual growth rate  Its earnings per share have compounded by about 9  per year over the last five years  fueled in part by share repurchases   2   
If the company can improve performance and stabilize asset flows  we believe BEN s earnings can return to a mid  to high single digit growth rate  assuming the market also continues its gradual ascent   This would imply total return potential of 8 10  per year 
Given the company s relatively low P E multiple  relatively high dividend yield  and healthy balance sheet  it looks cheap at first glance  However  we believe there is higher than average risk of BEN remaining a value trap given asset outflows  deteriorating performance trends  and volatile markets ConclusionFranklin Resources  dividend is very safe for now and even carries above average growth prospects  but the stock s total return over the next few years is largely a bet on the company s ability to slow asset outflows and get its performance back on track  The broader market environment also needs to remain favorable 
We continue to prefer asset manager T Rowe Price  O TROW  for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio  T  Rowe Price arguably has a stronger brand  better performance  and pays us more right off the bat with a 3 1  dividend yield compared to BEN s 2 1  yield ",2016-02-22,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ben:-a-possible-dividend-growth-bargain-200119106,200119106
