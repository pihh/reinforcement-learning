14488,236003,BLL,Factory Job Losses Undercut Macri s Pro Trade Talk in Argentina,news," Bloomberg     Argentine factories are shedding more jobs in the country s recession than any other sector  testing President Mauricio Macri s pro trade pledges just months before he faces re election 
Manufacturers eliminated 62 000 posts between this January and last  according to government numbers published Thursday  That amounts to almost half the total number of jobs shed by the entire private sector in that period  and compares to 42 000 positions lost in retail  the second worst hit industry 
Macri swept to power in 2015 with overtures to businesses  arguing that opening up the economy would attract more investment and better jobs while reducing poverty  Since then  he has disappointed local industries by failing to implement labor and tax reforms that executives deemed essential to better compete globally  Add to that plummeting demand and the world s highest interest rate  and now many manufacturers want tariffs to stay in place 
Argentina saw a surge in imports in 2017 before a currency crisis sunk the country into its second recession in three years  When put together  many manufacturers couldn t keep up 
Mariano Privitera is one of the many company owners who got crushed and is closing his business  His soccer ball factory already faced the highest labor costs in Latin America when a surge of imported China made balls set him back  Argentina s downturn was the final nail in the coffin  said Privitera  who voted for Macri in 2015 but won t do so this year 
 They re throwing us out to sea for the sharks if they open up the economy any more with such high fixed costs   he said   There isn t enough protectionism  
There are signs the pain is widespread  Even while shielded by tariffs  elevator manufacturers cut total headcount to 15 000 from 18 000 at the start of Macri s term  according to Leonardo Diletto  president of industry association Facara  As interest rates shot up  construction projects shuttered and the housing market collapsed  meaning elevator demand plunged too 
To be sure  some companies have still managed to grow   Ball Corp   NYSE BLL    a U S  based company that manufactures aluminum beverage cans in Argentina  saw its employee headcount increase 15 percent in the last two years  It plans to grow further in 2019 as more clients opt for aluminum over other materials like glass  a spokeswoman wrote to Bloomberg 
That s little consolation for those who lost their jobs at Privitera s factory  where he s down to five independent contractors from 20 a year ago and 50 in 2017  They re finishing up final orders before the business shutters for good 
 I m demoralized   said Privitera ",2019-03-28,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/factory-job-losses-undercut-macris-protrade-talk-in-argentina-1821388,1821388

14492,236007,BLL,Plastic bottles vs  aluminum cans  who ll win the global water fight ,news,"By Eric Onstad
LONDON  Reuters    Global bottled water giants are ramping up trials of easily recyclable aluminum cans to replace plastic that pollutes the world s seas  Sound like a slam dunk for the environment  Not entirely 
Aluminum cans might indeed mean less ocean waste  but they come with their own eco price  the production of each can pumps about twice as much carbon into the atmosphere as each plastic bottle 
French group  Danone   PA DANO  has become the latest company to make a move  telling Reuters it had started to replace some plastic bottles with aluminum cans for local water brands in Britain  Poland and Denmark 
The shift  previously unannounced  comes as multinational rivals like  Coca Cola Co   N KO   PepsiCo  O PEP  and Nestle  S NESN  are also launching some canned versions of water brands 
The beverage industry has been scrambling to react to public anger over scenes of huge piles of plastic waste contaminating oceans  pledging to step up recycling efforts 
However it s not black and white on the green front  By increasing recycling via cans  companies could fall back in efforts to reduce their carbon footprints  illustrating the tough juggling act they can face to keep environmentally conscious investors  campaigners and consumers on side 
 That s the dilemma you re going to have to choose between   said Ruben Griffioen  sustainability manager of packaging materials at Heineken  adding the company was trying to reduce both plastic waste and emissions 
Recycling plastic is more complex  leads to degradation and has lower reuse rates than aluminum   so the metal has been heralded as a greener alternative  Cans have on average 68  recycled content compared to just 3  for plastic in the United States  Environmental Protection Agency data shows 
New water brands are also making a splash 
 Mananalu will rid the world of plastic water containers and start a wave of change   says the website of the new canned water launched by Hollywood actor Jason Momoa  of Aquaman fame  Another entrant  Liquid Death  meanwhile  hails its  eco friendly cans  and uses the hashtag  DeathtoPlastic 
 The aluminum industry can play on the fact that its product is infinitely recyclable  and they re right   said Martin Barrow  director of footprinting at UK based non profit consultancy the Carbon Trust 
 But primary aluminum uses huge amounts of electricity and it s also got some chemical releases of greenhouse gas emissions    
Comparing the carbon footprints of aluminum and plastics is a complex calculation because making the metal with hydro power instead of fossil fuels reduces emissions while using recycled aluminum slashes it even further 
But when all types of metal are averaged out  however  cans still account for about double the greenhouse gases of plastic bottles  Barrow said  citing figures for Europe 
At aluminum s most polluting level  a 330 ml can is responsible for 1 300 grams of carbon dioxide emissions  according to the analysis compiled for Reuters  roughly equating to the emissions produced by driving a car 7 to 8 km 
A plastic bottle of the same size  made from the polyethylene terephthalate  PET  plastic typically used  accounts for up to 330 grams 
 NEVER THAT CLEAN 
Bruce Karas  an executive at Coca Cola North America in change of environment and sustainability  acknowledged the conflicting environmental pressures at play 
 When we look at a different material  you look at all of the levers  the carbon footprint  consumer preference  energy  water   he said   There s a mix  there are some things that are not that desirable  but if you have five good things and one that isn t  we ll all have to make decisions 
 It ll never be that clean  
So aluminum has a larger footprint in production because of the vast power needed in the smelting process  But  in a further example of the complexities of environmental impact  the overall carbon equation becomes more muddied when other issues such as logistics are taken into account 
 It s a complex picture  certainly   said Simon Lowden  an executive who leads Pepsi s plastics drive   You have to think about transport  secondary packaging  time in store  all those considerations come into play  
Because aluminum is lightweight and cans make efficient use of space  less transport is usually needed than for plastics or glass  while less power is also needed to chill drinks in cans   particularly useful in tropical climes 
 That means in some markets aluminum would actually not produce as much greenhouse gas   Lowden said

PLASTIC STRIKES BACK
But while cans could well carve out a niche within the  19 billion a year bottled water industry  they are unlikely to sweep the board anytime soon  if ever  industry experts say 
Simple economics is a major factor  aluminum is more expensive than plastic   the raw material cost for a can is about 25 30  higher than a PET bottle of a similar volume  according to analyst Uday Patel at consultancy Wood Mackenzie 
A broad shift to aluminum cans would raise costs for drinks companies  also including new manufacturing infrastructure  some of which are likely to be passed on to consumers  thus hitting products  competitiveness against plastic rivals 
Another key factor is consumer convenience 
How often do people down bottles of water in one go  While advances are being made in can technology  most cans are opened and stay open  while bottles can be recapped 
Plastic water bottles can also be sold in a range of sizes  while cans are more limited 
As a result of such factors  drinks giants are cautious 
 It s not necessarily saying we re pulling the plug on plastic  it s really looking at how do consumers react to canned water   said Coca Cola s Karas 
In an example of this toe in the water approach  Coke is planning a limited launch of its top U S  water brand Dasani in aluminum cans and aluminum resealable bottles later this year 
Even while companies are beginning to sell water in cans  to assuage pollution concerns  they are also embarking on a green makeover for plastic  Scientific efforts include creating new compounds that are biodegradable or more easily recyclable 
Danone told Reuters it was replacing some plastic with aluminum cans for its Flyte brand in Britain  Sparkles in Poland and Aqua d or in Denmark 
But the company  which uses 400 000 tonnes of PET plastic bottles each year  is also focusing on increasing recycling of plastic and plans to use an average of 50  recycled material in its water bottles by 2025 and 100  for its Evian brand 
And while Pepsi is testing aluminum for its Aquafina water at food service outlets  it is also introducing a plastic bottle made of 100  recycled material for another brand  LIFEWTR 
 The consideration for aluminum is much higher on the list than it has been for the last few years  but  the hardest thing to change is infrastructure   said Pepsi s Lowden 
     Hence our need to drive hard the recyclability of plastic as well as look at our mix of cans and glass  
CAN SHORTAGES
Another obstacle to a large scale shift from plastic bottles is that there may not be enough cans to go round  at a time when some beers and wines are also switching from glass to cans 
The world s top can maker  Ball Corp   N BLL   which supplies the likes of Coke and Pepsi  is already scrambling to add capacity to meet demand 
 This is a level of growth that we haven t seen in a long time  We re looking at a number of speed up projects  new can lines   said Kathleen Pitre  chief commercial and sustainability officer for Ball s global beverage packaging business 
Ball told investors it planned to add 4 5 billion additional cans of capacity by mid 2021 to its existing 105 billion  but this does not even include potential expansion in the water sector 
A shift of only 1  of global soft drinks  beer and bottled water from plastic and glass to cans  would mean a surge of 24 billion more cans  said the company  the third biggest stock gainer among the S P 500 index  SPX  over the past 12 months 
That 1  change would increase aluminum demand by around 310 000 tonnes  according to Patel at Wood Mackenzie and further shifts could counter wider market weakness 
Major aluminum producers  Alcoa   N AA  and Norsk Hydro  OL NHY  have cut estimates of global demand growth for aluminum recently  partly due to trade tensions between the United States and top metals consumer China  




 You re talking about billions and billions of water bottles  so there s a potential revival for the aluminum can market   said Patel   But it ll take three or four years to see if this is a real trend  ",2019-10-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/plastic-bottles-vs-aluminum-cans-wholl-win-the-global-water-fight-1997844,1997844

143409,364924,BLL,Behind the scenes  companies fight Trump on U S  steel tariffs,news,"By Ginger Gibson WASHINGTON  Reuters    American manufacturers  energy companies and retailers reliant on cheap steel are quietly lobbying against President Donald Trump s desire to impose tariffs on steel imports ahead of possible decision by the U S  Commerce Department next week   Honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign  in April this year Trump initiated a  Section 232  review of the steel industry  a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if they threaten national security  The provision has only been used to review imports twice before   The Commerce Department could issue findings on the matter as early as next week  a decision that three lobbyists say has been delayed due to debate inside the administration  Steel producers in the U S   like U S  Steel Corp and AK Steel stand to benefit from protectionist tariffs which would enable them to raise their prices   But U S  manufacturers and energy companies who use steel want to keep their costs down and say tariffs could costs jobs in their industries  while retailers need cheap steel for many facets of their business including shelving in their stores and warehouses  and to sell to consumers  Any U S  tariffs may also result in damage to unrelated industries if other countries retaliate by also imposing tariffs on American exports in sectors such as agriculture    Our member companies have quietly had these conversations with both members of the administration but also with the Hill   said Hun Quach  the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association   Those in favor of approving new tariffs include not only steel manufacturers  but some aligned unions  They have allies in Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  a former U S  Steel lawyer who has promised to recuse himself from decisions regarding the industry  PROS AND CONS Mario Longhi  who until a few weeks ago was chief executive of U S  Steel  said earlier this year that curbing cheap steel imports could restore jobs for 10 000 American steel workers   The U S  steel industry employed about 147 000 people in 2015  according to the Commerce Department s Bureau of Economic analysis   But manufacturers that need steel employ about 6 5 million people each year  and the construction industry supports another 6 3 million jobs   Manufacturers argue that pushing up the cost of steel by imposing tariffs on imports ultimately hurts American consumers who will pay more for everyday goods made from steel  such as lawn mowers  washing machines  and microwaves  When former President George W  Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002  the move was found illegal by the World Trade Organization which permitted other countries to retaliate against American exports and Bush was forced to back down  Studies by the free trade lobby group  the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition  CITAC   found that 200 000 workers in U S  manufacturing lost their jobs as a result of the 2002 steel tariffs  POLITICAL RISK Pushing back against something that was a signature piece of Trump s campaign carries some political risk though and most companies would only elaborate on their lobbying efforts anonymously  saying they were making their case to Trump and lawmakers behind closed doors   They see allies in Gary Cohn  the head of the National Economic Council and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue   We ve been quite vocal both on the Hill and in the administration   said a lobbyist for a large manufacturing company that uses both U S  steel and imported steel  but who declined to speak on the record over concerns public statements could damage relationships with the White House   Several companies have also been pressing members of Congress to advocate against tariffs with the administration on their behalf  said several lobbyists   Several companies  including National Oilwell Varco Inc  NYSE NOV    Ball Corporation  NYSE BLL   and Electrolux  submitted public comments to the Commerce Department arguing against tariffs   The American Petroleum Industry  which represents the largest oil refiners and chemical companies including ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   Shell  LON RDSa  Oil Company   Chevron   NYSE CVX  and  Dow Chemical  Company  NYSE DOW   issued forceful comments against the proposed tariffs  as did the American Automotive Policy Council  which includes Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  and General Motors  NYSE GM

143434,364949,BLL,Special Report  Why an emblematic American city has turned to Trump,news,"By Timothy Aeppel MUNCIE  Indiana  Reuters    One night a month  retired auto workers shuffle into a former elementary school classroom here to discuss their legal fight against the company that cancelled their health care benefits seven years ago  But the conversation often turns quickly to presidential politics   It can get pretty heated   says Gerald Poor  the group s 77 year old president  of their political discussions   I call it to order if it gets out of hand   Their anger is understandable  The group is a remnant of a once powerful United Auto Workers union local  which at its peak in the 1960s represented over 5 000 workers who made transmissions in Muncie for BorgWarner Inc  NYSE BWA   the global auto parts maker  An American flag drapes the wall at one end of the room  portraits of former labor bosses line the other  salvaged from a union hall that had its own baseball field  For this group of mostly white  working class men  the last two decades have brought much loss  In this election   with the victory of the populist Donald Trump as the Republican Party nominee and the strong run by the populist Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Party crown   many say they feel they re finally being heard again   Working class white men were once a force to be reckoned with in American politics  Many here speak wistfully of how John F  Kennedy stopped at BorgWarner to talk to workers when he campaigned in 1960  For these men  this year s election is a rare taste of the clout they once took for granted  In the primary  Trump received the most votes of any candidate in either party in Delaware County  which encompasses Muncie  Just over 52 percent of Republican voters went for Trump  Democrats picked Sanders over Hillary Clinton by an even wider margin    Candidates in the past made a lot of promises to the working class in this country and failed to follow through with it   says 66 year old Bruce Reynolds  who followed his father and grandfather into a career at BorgWarner  Gazing through the rusted chain link fence that encircles the sprawling  abandoned factory  where he notes with precision that he worked for  32 and a half years   he says he s still skeptical of both side s promises  THE WHITE SLIDE Neither Trump nor Clinton was his first choice  Reynolds and his wife voted for Sanders in the primary  he says  Among other things  they couldn t support Clinton  She s the wife of former President Bill Clinton  who signed the North American Free Trade Agreement  which many here blame for Muncie s economic decline  They were uneasy with the often fiery rhetoric of Trump  the other side s top candidate  Yet both plan to vote for Trump in November  and Reynolds says they ve grown comfortable with the choice   I know  it sounds like we re confused   he says  But they re not   Like many Trump supporters  he glides over the unappealing aspects of the candidate s message to lock onto those that he likes  For Reynolds  it s the hope of bringing back jobs for his children  some of whom still struggle to find decent work   Trump s gloomy world view is often dismissed as hyperbole  such as when he described crime and collapsed economies in America s cities at the Republican National Convention  But for someone in Muncie  that s not far off reality  An analysis by Reuters found Delaware County is an extreme example of the declining fortunes of America s white working class men   In 2000  white men with less than a college degree accounted for about three quarters of all white men living in the county  By 2014  their proportion had dropped by about 5 percentage points  according to the US Census Bureau  But while this group s share of the population held relatively steady  the earnings of white men with full time jobs had fallen dramatically   In 2000  47 percent of white men working full time were in the bottom third of earners  with incomes of  50 000 or less  based on 2015 dollars  By 2014  60 percent of them were in the bottom third   Meanwhile  the percentage of white men in full time jobs making between  50 000 and  100 000 dropped from 43 percent to 32 percent  And the percentage in the ranks of earners above  100 000 slipped from 11 percent to 8 percent   In essence  white men in Muncie have slid down from every rung of the economic ladder  They have clustered at the bottom  poorer and more isolated than ever before  even as the overall U S  economy has grown and globalized  MUNCIE AS  MIDDLETOWN  The same trend is visible in faded industrial pockets from New Jersey and upstate New York to Alabama and Kentucky   According to the data  in about 1 800 counties across the United States nearly 60 percent of those where data is available the share of white men in the lowest group of earners has grown over this period  The trend is particularly pronounced in the Rust Belt states of Michigan  Ohio and Indiana  Jonathan Haidt  a social psychologist at New York University s Stern School of Business  studies how people adopt their political beliefs   Trump is the first candidate to speak to and speak for working class white men in a long time   Haidt says  That separates him from the last two Republican nominees  Mitt Romney  who lost in 2012  didn t do that   and John McCain didn t particularly reach out to that constituency  in 2008  As for Trump s extreme positions and outright falsehoods  Haidt notes   If your hero says things that are untrue  you ll cut him slack   Muncie was once the epitome of America s muscular manufacturing economy  After natural gas was discovered here late in the 19th century  the city attracted dozens of energy intensive glass manufacturers  most notably  Ball Corp   NYSE BLL   which built sprawling factories that churned out millions of mason jars  The auto industry followed  and Muncie became a hub for transmission making  The term  Muncie transmission  is still used by hot rod enthusiasts when talking about gearboxes produced here by General Motors  NYSE GM  Corp in the 1960s  One particularly powerful version is the  rock crusher   used in Corvettes and other muscle cars  BorgWarner  based in Auburn Hills  Michigan  has even deeper roots in Muncie than GM  Warner Gear was founded here in 1901 and merged with other businesses to create what became BorgWarner in the late 1920s  Many former workers here still call it Warner Gear  In the 1920s  a husband and wife team of sociologists picked the city to study the values in a typical American community  They called it  Middletown   to conceal the identity of a place they felt was emblematic of the country as a whole  Muncie residents soon figured out it was all about them  The Center for Middletown Studies at Ball State University has continued the work  compiling oral histories and  in recent years  focused on the devastation of deindustrialization  James Connolly  a history professor who runs the center  says that more than anything else  Muncie s working class white men feel a loss of power  When the big factories were humming  the unions were an unstoppable force not just for getting good paychecks and lush benefits  but a voice in almost everything else  UNION POWER To illustrate this power  he cites a locally famous episode from the 1960s  when waitresses at a big downtown hotel went on strike for higher wages    A group of police got rough and tried to break up the pickets   says Connolly  A local union leader who had nothing to do with the waitresses  other than knowing about them through community connections called the then mayor  who was visiting Washington  and  ordered him home  to intervene  The mayor returned and the police backed off   The strikers weren t union members but there was a system of connections that gave them a sense of control   says Connolly  With the decline of the unions  working class people  feel like they ve been robbed of that voice   And yet unions  which were unable to prevent the factory closures that ravaged the city  are often viewed just as suspiciously here as most national politicians are  That tension is visible at the old school where the BorgWarner retirees meet   The Muncie Delaware County Senior Center was created to give retirees from the big factories  particularly men  a place to go for companionship and activities  One recent day  the room the BorgWarner retirees use was filled with seniors learning line dancing   Some people don t like the photos  of the union leaders  says Jim Shields  a janitor  motioning toward the 10 portraits that adorn the front of the room  They feel the images carry an implicitly political  pro union message  So  there was a fuss the last time the building was used as a polling station  he said   We had complaints   Now  when the BorgWarner retiree group isn t meeting  Shields carefully drapes a long bolt of fabric over the pictures to conceal them  Michael Hicks  a Ball State economist who studies manufacturing  says a mix of exasperation with unions and the political elite created the perfect opening for Trump   It s always easier to blame a larger force for your problems  whether that s Mexicans or greedy factory owners   he says   But these people aren t stupid  They know the jobs aren t coming back   The bigger concern for many of them  he says  is what will happen to their children  The Reynolds family is a good example  Bruce Reynolds s oldest son  Bruce Jr  is a Baptist pastor and is supporting Trump  albeit reluctantly   I don t think any of them can fix it   Bruce Jr says of the fallout he sees from economic hardship in his congregation  from growing drug addiction to broken families  FROM FACTORY TO WAREHOUSE Reynolds s second son  Robert  followed his father into BorgWarner after high school  That job didn t last  After just four years  he was laid off in 1994 during a wave of downsizing  He and his father say it was a trauma from which he never fully recovered   I make  8 an hour less now than I made 21 years ago   says Robert  who enthusiastically backs Trump  After a series of low paying jobs  including a stint at Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  and as a manager of a video store  he now works overnight shifts at a warehouse for  18 an hour  He likes the job  he says  although the company recently cut three paid holidays  including the Fourth of July  Robert concedes that he finds the Republican candidate s approach to foreign policy worrisome   You wonder if something will upset him and he ll declare war   he says   That would be awful   He also doesn t like how race and immigration has become a theme in the campaign   This country was built on bring us your tired  your poor  I think we should honor what our forefathers built   he says  But he also doesn t believe Trump s message is racist   I think he s looking at all the illegal activity going on in the U S  and how it affects the job market   he says   He s just not very tactful  in how he expresses this  Meanwhile  Trump s promise to restore the economy is the draw  To be sure  Muncie has retained some of its smaller factories  and other jobs have come in  including a call center that tracks down delinquent student loans and a  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT  locomotive factory that moved into an old plant  But none of these are unionized  and the wages and benefits aren t as high as the old places offered  One frustration for locals is that the statistical measures of the economy don t seem to reflect what they see around them  Muncie s jobless rate is 5 7 percent  less than one percentage point higher than the national rate of 4 9 percent or Indiana s 4 6 percent  But the impact of deindustrialization including the exodus of over 10 000 factory jobs since 1970 in a city of only 70 000 people is visible almost everywhere   Most of the departing companies tore down their factories  leaving lots strewn with weeds and rubble  BorgWarner left a handful of structures including a 1 2 million square foot sprawl of red brick and steel near the edge of town  The city  especially the once thriving white working class neighborhoods on the south side  is now dotted with over 2 000 abandoned houses  Some can t be occupied because they were contaminated by chemicals left behind by meth labs   PHOTOGRAPH FROM A HAPPIER TIME Meanwhile  the FBI recently opened a probe of the city government  which appears to be focused on possible corruption in its blight clearing program and the sanitation district  The FBI wouldn t comment on the investigation  and Mayor Dennis Tyler said he can t talk about it  There have been no indictments in the case  and it s possible no charges will result  Mayor Tyler  a Democrat  notes the jobless rate stood just under 10 percent four years ago  when he took office  so there s been improvement  But he understands working class frustration    They feel they ve intentionally been left behind by trade agreements this country imposed on them over the last 25 years   says Tyler  Trump s appeal here isn t restricted to working class white men  Another local supporter is Todd Murray  president and CEO of family owned Mursix Corp  which makes auto parts including tiny switches that go inside door locks and interior lights  His company has grown rapidly in recent years and now employs over 300 people  Murray says he knows some of Trump s trade proposals such as putting hefty tariffs on goods from Mexico and China could hit his own business  He exports 60 percent of his output  mostly to Mexico  and operates his own small plant in China  But he insists he s  not smart enough to know how that would all shake out   He still strongly favors the Republican standard bearer  who he sees as more pro business  But the economy alone doesn t explain Trump s appeal  Another family with deep roots at BorgWarner is the Lephart clan  At one point in the 1950s and 1960s  the patriarch and nine of his sons worked there  a fact immortalized in the company magazine by a photo of the group posed on a tall step ladder  each holding a lunch bucket  except for the brother at the top  who holds the family dog  David Lephart  whose father is one of the nine brothers  avoided the decline entirely through shrewd job hopping and retraining but he s still a Trump supporter  He commutes to a UAW job as a pipefitter at a GM plant in Marion  Indiana  He earns about  100 000 a year  with overtime  he says  and has put both of his children through college   The 58 year old says one thing that influenced his transition from Democrat to Republican was talking to his children  whom he describes as part of the  business world   His son is now a stockbroker in Indianapolis  
 For the first half of my life  I thought Democrat was the only way to be   Lephart says   There s this belief that you can t be Republican and union but I don t believe that any more    Data reporting by Maurice Tamman  Edited by Michael Williams ",2016-08-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/special-report:-why-an-emblematic-american-city-has-turned-to-trump-423128,423128

143490,365005,BLL,Ball  BLL  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Ball  BLL  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This metal packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  30 4  
Revenues are expected to be  3 05 billion  up 3 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 27  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ball 
For Ball  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 83  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ball will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ball would post earnings of  0 65 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 64  delivering a surprise of  1 54  
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

143495,365010,BLL,Ball Corp Rides On Growing Beverage Can Demand Amid FX Woes,opinion,"On Dec 6  we issued an updated research report on Ball Corporation   NYSE BLL    Overall global beverage can demand continues to grow as customers are now preferring cans over glass and plastic  The company seems well poised to capitalize on this demand by investing in capacity expansion and new products  Robust backlog also signals continued momentum in the aerospace segment  However  headwinds related to currency  higher freight rates and tight metal supply in the United States remain headwinds 
Let s analyze these factors in detail 
Rising Beverage Can Demand  A Key CatalystGlobal beverage can demand continues to grow as customers now prefer cans over glass and plastic  The company remains well positioned to bank on this demand by investing in capacity and products It expects capital spending to be more than  600 million in 2019 and days ahead   Ball Corporation continues to focus on initiatives in order to achieve better value for standard products and higher growth for specialty products  The company s cost cutting actions will also bolster margins 
Investments in Capacity to Meet DemandBall Corporation s balance sheet remains healthy and provides flexibility to invest in capacity while returning value to shareholders  The company has been primarily investing in aluminum packaging production to cater to the rising demand for aluminum cans  bottles and cups  It is focused on improving operational efficiencies and ramping up the previously announced line additions and greenfield plant expansions  in order to add at least 5 billion units of capacity over the next 12 18 months  Additionally  the company successfully launched lightweight aluminum cups in response to customers  increasing demand for sustainable products  Ball Corporation also announced its plan to construct a new beverage can plant in Glendale  AZ  to support the new can filling facility for customers  Further  the company completed the sale of its China beverage can business and expects to receive the cash proceeds in the ongoing quarter 
Ongoing Momentum in SegmentsThe company expects to achieve EBITDA of  2 billion and free cash flow of  900 million in 2019  backed by continued strong demand for aluminum packaging and robust aerospace backlog  The Beverage Packaging  North and Central America segment will benefit from volume growth  product introductions and capacity expansion The Beverage Packaging  South America segment is also poised well for improved results in 2019  driven by product launches for beer  wine  energy and still water in cans  and multiple brewery expansions  The Beverage Packaging  Europe segment will gain on customers  growing preference for cans and increased production from new lines in the company s existing facilities Ball Corporation expects the Aerospace segment s earnings and revenues to register strong double digit growth over the next few years   The Aerospace segment has won contracts worth  4 5 billion since the end of third quarter 2019  Few Headwinds AheadHeadwinds related to currency and higher freight rates are likely to affect Ball Corporation s results  Furthermore  the North and Central America segment has been incurring short term costs due to tight inventories  This can be attributed to strong demand growth  particularly in specialty can sizes  Moreover  the business remains challenged with U S  aluminum scrap headwinds Price PerformanceBall Corporation s shares have gained 31 5  over the past year against the  s growth of 35 3  Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderBall Corporation currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Some better ranked stocks in the Industrial Products sector are Northwest Pipe Company   NASDAQ NWPX    Tennant Company   NYSE TNC   and Sharps Compliance Corp   NASDAQ SMED    All of these stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   at present  You can see  Northwest Pipe has an expected earnings growth rate of 15 8  for the current year  The stock has appreciated 53  over the past year Tennant has a projected earnings growth rate of 29 8  for 2019  The company s shares have rallied 41  over the past year Sharps Compliance has an estimated earnings growth rate of 500  for the ongoing year  In a year s time  the company s shares have gained 38  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  24 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  77 6 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2019-12-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ball-corp-rides-on-growing-beverage-can-demand-amid-fx-woes-200491205,200491205
143496,365011,BLL,Ball  BLL  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Ball  BLL  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This metal packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  23 6  
Revenues are expected to be  2 89 billion  up 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 12  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ball 
For Ball  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 15  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ball will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ball would post earnings of  0 73 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 70  delivering a surprise of  4 11

143546,365061,BLL,Ball Corporation Heading For Congestion,opinion,"I ve moved to the monthly chart for this stock which is the Ball Corporation  NYSE BLL  as this once again demonstrates the importance of the technical picture when considering stock investing for the longer term  Whilst this is a slow timeframe  the same principles apply to a weekly  daily or intraday chart 
If we start with the support and resistance regions  once again they are defined by the Quantum accumulation and distribution indicator on NinjaTrader as the stock congested in a tight range over an extended period  with the ceiling created at  42 and the floor at  30 80  The volume point of control remains anchored at  38 and denoted with extreme volume and the VPOC itself in yellow  Finally  towards the end of last year  the stock breaks away from this region on excellent volume which confirms the market makers are developing the price higher and which has continued since the start of the year in a series of clean up candles  suggesting there is more to come in the near future  However  a note of caution is now on the horizon since we see a classic scenario of potential weakness ahead with steadily rising prices associated with steadily falling volume  Effort and result are in disagreement 
However  what is also interesting here is the trend of the stock this month has continued higher and in sharp contrast to the trend in the major indices which have been selling off over Sino US tariff worries 
So in summary  a warning has been posted  and we can expect to see a pause and possible congestion  but should this phase see further buying by the market makers at the current levels  then further gains will follow  Note also how the trend monitor indicator continues to support the bullish picture with only a short period of sentiment reversal occurring in the mid part of last year  and with low volume now ahead on the volume point of control histogram  this too will help to provide an easy path through provided the congestion phase on the horizon is not too extensive and the up candles are supported with strong and rising volume ",2019-05-09,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ball-corporation-heading-for-congestion-200419251,200419251

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ball 
For Ball  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 55  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ball will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ball would post earnings of  0 50 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 49  delivering a surprise of  2  
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

143574,365089,BLL,Ball  BLL  Reports Next Week  What You Should Expect,opinion,"Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on lower revenues when Ball  BLL  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This metal packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  2 65 billion  down 4 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ball 
For Ball  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ball will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ball would post earnings of  0 56 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 55  delivering a surprise of  1 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Ball doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ball-bll-reports-next-week-what-you-should-expect-200411048,200411048

143594,365109,BLL,3 Basic Materials Stocks Worth Considering Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"It s been a brutal year for basic materials shares  The S P 500 Basic Materials Index is down roughly 11 3  year to date versus a 5 1  gain for the broader market as investors continue to punish the sector 
A number of factors have been blamed for the downbeat performance including sluggish raw material prices  softening demand in China  and pressure from a strong dollar  Accordingly  Q3 earnings results will need to be pretty robust in order for companies in the sector to have any hope of flipping that negative view 

Consensus expectations anticipate that the Materials sector will deliver the third highest year over year earnings growth of all eleven sectors at 25 0   according to FactSet  outstripping the 19 1  earnings growth rate predicted for the S P 500 
At the industry level  all four industries in the sector are predicted to report double digit earnings growth  Metals   Mining   46    Construction Materials   33    Containers   Packaging   29    and Chemicals   20    Major basic materials companies on the S P 500 are expected to start reporting Q3 results at the end of this week 
Below we highlight three of the most attractive names in the sector  Each is worth considering ahead of earnings 
1  Cleveland Cliffs
Formerly known as Cliffs Natural Resources  Cleveland Cliffs  NYSE CLF  is the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America  It is also a supplier of metallurgical coal to the global steel making industry 
Cleveland Cliffs operates six iron ore mines in Michigan  Minnesota and Eastern Canada  and three coking coal mines in West Virginia and Alabama  Cliffs also owns 80 4  of Portman  an iron ore mining company in Australia  serving the Asian iron ore markets with direct shipping fines and lump ore 
The company is expected to report Q3 earnings per share  EPS  of  0 67 on revenue of  722 31 million when it releases results before the market opens on Friday  October 19  That would mark a 73  year on year EPS increase from the same quarter last year  when Cleveland Cliffs posted much more modest earnings of  0 18 per share on revenue of  670 94 million 

Shares have been on a tear this year  The stock is up 63 4  since January  versus an 8 2  decline for the industry  Currently trading at  11 8 per share  Cleveland Cliffs hit a new 52 week high of  13 10 on September 26  The stock looks poised for further capital appreciation  as it benefits from increasing demand for iron ore 
2  The Mosaic Company
Through it subsidiaries  the Mosaic Company  NYSE MOS  produces and markets concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients worldwide  The company operates via three segments  Phosphates  Potash  and International Distribution 
Mosaic owns and operates mines  which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients  such as diammonium phosphate  monoammonium phosphate  and ammoniated phosphate products  The company is scheduled to report Q3 2018 results on Monday  November 5 after the closing bell  Wall Street is looking for EPS of  0 64 cents on revenue of  2 92 billion 
For the same period last year  Mosaic posted earnings of  0 43 per share on revenue of  1 98 billion  Shares  which are currently trading at  33 13  have rallied 29 1  this year  driven by the company s upbeat earnings outlook  along with strong demand and pricing fundamentals for crop nutrients 

Healthy prospects from its acquisition of Vale s Vale Fertilizantes business in early January should bode well for the stock going forward  The buyout turned Mosaic into one of the leading fertilizer manufacturing and distribution companies in Brazil  putting it in an excellent position to capitalize on the rapidly growing Brazilian agricultural market 
3  Ball Corporation
As the world s largest manufacturer of recyclable metal beverage and food containers  Ball Corporation  NYSE BLL  is best known for its early production of glass jars  lids  and related products used for home canning  The company operates in five segments  Beverage Packaging  North and Central America  Beverage Packaging  South America  Beverage Packaging  Europe  Food and Aerosol Packaging  and Aerospace

Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   DuPont  NYSE DD  and HCA Holdings  HCA   These reports have been hand picked from amongst the roughly 70 reports issued by our analyst team today  You can see the complete list of 
Exxon Mobil shares have lagged the Zacks Energy sector   13  vs   22 4   in the year to date period  but they have outperformed the S P 500 index   13  vs   9 2     The analyst highlights the company s leading position in the energy industry owing to the size and diversity of its asset base  both in terms of business mix as well as geographical footprint  As one of the most oil weighted majors  the company s upstream business is poised to benefit from the current OPEC deal and the subsequent advancement of crude oil  Moreover  the company s recent discovery of huge recoverable oil resources on the Owowo field offshore Nigeria is a major positive  Exxon s stellar balance sheet and a long history of paying a regular dividend are some of the other positives   You can  
DuPont shares have underperformed the Zacks Basic Materials sector   10 8  vs   28   in the year to date period  but they have nevertheless done better than the broader market  The analyst likes DuPont s aggressive cost cutting actions and new product launches  The company continues to impress operationally  with Q3 results coming in better than expected  outlook for the current period raised and management reassuring about the Dow deal  DuPont has unveiled redesign actions to support its more focused portfolio of businesses following the spinoff of the performance chemicals unit  Moreover  it remains committed to maximize shareholder value   You can  
HCA Holdings shares have gained more than  6  year to date  lagging the broader market but clearly outperforming the Zacks Medical Hospitals industry   6 4  vs   11 6    Concerns about the future of ObamaCare remain a major headwind for HCA as well as the industry as a whole  but the company s competitive advantage resulting from the scale and diversity of its operations as one of the largest non governmental operators of acute care hospitals in the country puts it in a better position relative to its peers  Its top line has been growing over the past several quarters due to robust volumes  improved payor and service mix  and effective cost management  However  the company s bad debts are likely to drain its bottom line and pricing growth in the medium term is likely be affected as payor mix shifts away from managed care to lower priced Government business  You can

143708,365223,BLL,Can 3D Systems  DDD  Spring An Earnings Surprise In Q3 ,opinion,"3D Systems Corporation   NYSE DDD   is slated to report third quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Nov 3 
3D Systems has an extremely volatile earnings history  oscillating between incredible beats and abysmal misses over the trailing four quarters  Last quarter  it had posted an incredible beat of 600   which followed an abysmal negative earnings surprise of 400  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
3D Systems  broad portfolio of healthcare offerings is likely to turn out to be one of the strongest profit churners in the upcoming quarterly results  Leveraging on its core competence in expanding healthcare solutions is one of the company s five pronged core growth strategies 
During second quarter 2016  revenue from healthcare and related applications increased 11  year over year  driven by the company s extensive offerings  as well as expansion by clients who print medical and dental devices  During the quarter  it expanded its Virtual Surgical Planning Reconstruction product line with the launch of  Jaw in a Day  service 
Particularly  precision healthcare offerings like printers and materials  surgical simulation and planning and printing of devices and tools contributed to growth  This apart  the company s other four growth channels  namely expansion of quickparts services  accelerating 3D printer penetration through channel expansion  launch of integrated 3D authoring solutions platform and strengthening of partnerships are expected to prove conducive to growth in the soon to be reported quarter 
In fact  the quarter saw 3D Systems forge an important partnership with PTC  This alliance will see the two leaders joining forces to integrate 3D Systems  3D Sprint SDK into PTC s flagship Creo CAD platform  This will  in turn  deliver seamless CAD to print functionality to Creo users  in addition to an entire set of print management tools  Further  the leading 3D printing player launched its 3DXpert software for direct metal 3D printing 
During the quarter  3D Systems released the Geomagic Control X software for 3D inspection and metrology   an easy to use solution that meets the measurement analysis requirements of manufacturers globally  The leading 3D printing player also launched its 3DXpert software for direct metal 3D printing  In addition  the company s operational restructuring initiatives like improving the sales network as well as undertaking lean manufacturing initiatives in supply chain operations are likely to drive results 
Over the past few quarters  the company has been witnessing particularly unfavorable broader market conditions that have hit its financial performance severely  It has been grappling with macroeconomic headwinds such as economic slowdown  inflation  currency fluctuations  commodity prices and credit availability  Further  sustained softness in prototyping  stiff competition and general macro headwinds which are affecting the sector  will likely also hurt 3D Systems  results 
In the previous quarter  revenues from 3D printing products and services were significantly undermined due to continued challenging market conditions that hampered customers  capital investment cycles and reduced demand across all geographies 
Also  cutthroat competition in the industry  along with factors like escalating research   development and selling   administrative expenses are likely to impair the financials to some extent  However  the company s restructuring initiatives might curtail costs and provide a much needed boost to profits 
3D SYSTEMS CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 
   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that 3D Systems will beat earnings estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are at a break even level 
Zacks Rank  3D Systems  Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP as well to be confident about an earnings beat 
Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Avon Products Inc    NYSE AVP    slated to release earnings results on Nov 3  has an Earnings ESP of  33 33  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  
Ball Corporation   NYSE BLL    scheduled to release results on Nov 3  has an Earnings ESP of  5 44  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Enbridge Inc    NYSE ENB   has an Earnings ESP of  27 59  and boasts a Zacks Rank  1  The company will report results on Nov 3

143746,365261,BLL,Hillenbrand  HI  To Report Q3 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Hillenbrand Inc    NYSE HI    the holding company for Batesville Casket Company  a leader in the North American death care industry  is set to report third quarter fiscal 2016 results on Aug 3  Last quarter  this global diversified industrial company posted a negative earnings surprise of 14 04  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Hillenbrand s focus on acquisitions  its global presence and margin expansion through operational improvement have been driving earnings since the past few quarters 
In Feb 2016  Hillenbrand completed its acquisition of Red Valve Company  a global leader in highly engineered valves  The acquisition will complement the acquisition of ABEL  in November  and will expand its presence in the flow control market  We expect these acquisitions to boost growth in the to be reported quarter 
However  the company has been facing certain challenges over the past year  including currency  deficit environment for capital investments and a slowdown in some key markets  especially China  Slower economic growth has been particularly difficult for industries such as mining  plastics  and for equipment used in the production of potash  frac sand and other commodities 
Though the company has taken a number of actions to reduce its costs and boost its profitability  many of the customers will continue to face uncertainty  without any clear signs of improvement in the near term  Additionally  the company forecasts lower volume in the burial market this year due to a lighter than expected flu season and an increase in cremation rate  The company continues to expect challenging end markets for the Process Equipment Group and Batesville in fiscal 2016    HILLENBRAND INC Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hillenbrand is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  ESP for Hillenbrand is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 51 cents per share 
Zacks Rank  Hillenbrand has a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Stocks in the industrial sector that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are 
Harsco Corporation   NYSE HSC    with an Earnings ESP of  38 46  and a Zacks Rank  1 
Ball Corporation   NYSE BLL    with an Earnings ESP of  1 01  and a Zacks Rank  3

Normal P E Since 1999Performance Table Ball CorpThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 15 3  Annualized ROR  w o Div   green circle   long term shareholders of Ball Corp  assuming an

143780,365295,BLL,Market Analyzes ECB s Move  U K  And Germany Disappoint,opinion,The ECB s decision yesterday to no longer accept Greek government bonds or state  guaranteed paper  but approving Emergency Lending Assistance  ELA  by the national central bank remains a key talking point today  The timing of the decision is particularly intriguing following the meeting between new Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis and Draghi  before Varoufakis met with German Finance Minister Schaeuble  There is much speculation of who said what and how the vote at the ECB went  recall that in February  under the new voting regime  Greece  Cyprus  Ireland and France could not vote   However  as often is the case  the simpler solution  Occam s Razor   Taking the ECB s statement at face value makes sense  Getting the Greek position from the horse s mouth so to speak  made it clear that Greece was persisting down a path of confrontation with the official creditors  The ECB s statement said in effect that one could not be confident that a deal will be struck  This was also the read from Schaeuble s meeting with Varoufakis  There appeared to have been an exchange of views  but without either side moving  This is what brinkmanship is all about  If this is true  we would be surprised with a deal before the last possible moment  Separately  the latest IMF reserve data gives some sense of the SNB s activity last month  Reserves rose by about CHF 3 3 bln to CHF 498 4 bln  This understates the magnitude of the intervention because of the appreciation of the franc  The franc appreciated sharply following the mid month decision to abandon the cap  The franc appreciated by 16  against the euro  which accounts about half of the SNB s reserves  It rose 8  against the dollar and 12  against sterling  It is difficult to ascertain the precise amount of intervention  but it could be between CHF 50 60 bln  A SNB member suggested last month that it may have cost the SNB CHF100 bln if it would have continued to defend the cap  The take away is confirmation that the abandonment of the cap did not mean that the SNB s balance sheet had reached some limit or that it has embraced a free float of the franc  Some had speculated that the ownership structure of the SNB was the basis for the change  We suspect the SNB s decision about the conduct of monetary policy  this includes the initial buying of foreign bonds  the cap and now the dirty float can be explained independently of the peculiar ownership structure  cantons and individuals   Meanwhile  Denmark cut interest rates again yesterday  now  75 bp the same as the SNB  to defend its narrow 1  band against the euro The UK s trade balance continued to disappoint  The shortfall  merchandise or  visibles   in December was GBP10 2 bln  which was about 10  larger than expected  The deterioration can be accounted for by non EU trade  That deficit increased to almost GBP 3 8 bln from nearly GBP 2 8 bln  The impact on sterling was partly neutralized by demand vs the euro and reports that US Ball Corp was offering GBP 4 3 bln cash for the UK s Rexam  Following the strong industrial orders data yesterday  Germany reported disappointing industrial output figures for December today  The 0 1  gain contrasts with the 0 4  consensus expectation  Spain also reported disappointing industrial output figures  Rather than increase 0 3  as the consensus expected  it fell 0 9  year over year  It might have provided another excuse to pare the euro s gains ahead of US employment data  Norway  on the other hand  reported a 1 3  increase in December s manufacturing output  The consensus had expected a 0 3  decline  It is a particularly volatile time series  but that coupled with the continued recovery in oil prices helped the krone  The focus ahead of the weekend is on the US and Canadian jobs report  The key in the US  barring a significant surprise on the headline or revisions  is the hourly earnings data  We suspect that the December decline was a bit of a fluke  but if they do not bounce back  expectations for a mid year Fed hike will be further undermined  and this would be dollar negative  Canada reported a net job loss in December of 4 3k  This masked a huge jump in full time positions  53 5k  and drop in part time jobs   57 7k   The market  as oil was offered  focused more on the headline figure than the details  For today s report  the consensus expects a net gain of 5k jobs  While oil prices are firm  the near term technicals for the Canadian dollar remain weak  Later today  the Baker Hughes oil and gas rig count will be released  Even though the rig count is not closely correlated with output  it will be interesting to see if the stabilization of oil prices slowed the cuts in the rig count ,2015-02-06,Marc Chandler,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/focus-on-us-jobs,-while-market-debates-details-of-ecb's-move-241101",241101
