161955,383471,HD,Mexican union suspends strike threat against Home Depot,news,"MEXICO CITY  Reuters    A top Mexican trade union said on Monday it has suspended its threat to launch a strike at  Home Depot   NYSE HD  stores across Mexico over labor demands  adding it is in talks with the U S  home improvement chain to improve pay and benefits for workers 
The Revolutionary Confederation of Laborers and Farmworkers  or CROC  is pressing for a 20  pay raise  benefits such as 20 annual vacation days and more contributions toward transportation  school supplies  food and savings funds 
Home Depot has about 6 200 workers under the union s contracts  according to CROC  out of a total of 16 000 Home Depot employees across 125 stores in Mexico 
The negotiation process is being overseen by local labor councils  said CROC spokesman Eduardo Miranda 
 If there is no agreement between the parties  they establish a day and time to launch the strike   he said 
The demands for Home Depot  where CROC has 40 collective contracts in 18 Mexican states  in part grew out of the United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA   which includes strict labor protections 
The trade pact was approved by the U S  Senate last week  and will now go to President Donald Trump for him to sign into law 
Home Depot did not immediately reply to a request for comment  It previously told Reuters it was committed to complying with the law ",2020-01-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mexican-union-suspends-strike-threat-against-home-depot-2063376,2063376

161958,383474,HD,NASCAR Hall of Fame to honor Stewart s love of racing,news,"For those who ever watched him race  saw him win and win and win  watched him hoist NASCAR s cherished Cup Series championship trophy  again and again and again    Tony Stewart s place in the NASCAR Hall of Fame certainly seemed an inevitability  And on Friday evening  Stewart  48  will be enshrined with a group of the sport s highest achievers in the NASCAR Hall of Fame    joining his former team owner Joe Gibbs and former teammate Bobby Labonte along with legendary crew chief Waddell Wilson and the late  multi talented Buddy Baker  Perhaps fittingly this Class of 2020 is one of the most diverse representations in the sport    including a team owner  championship drivers  a heralded crew chief and a driver turned broadcaster extraordinaire  For all his career  Stewart has proven to be among the most diversely talented competitors    winning in every form of racing  in whatever kind of car he drove  Stewart dazzled fans and impressed fellow competitors in a three time NASCAR Cup championship driving career  2002  2005  2011   He is the only driver in history to have won both a premier NASCAR Cup Series title and an IndyCar championship  1997   And Stewart is also the only driver to have won a NASCAR championship under the longstanding former points system  2002  2005  and the new playoff system  2011   His 2011 NASCAR Cup Series title came as both driver and team owner  And he added another owner s trophy in 2014 when his Stewart Haas Racing team earned the Cup championship with driver Kevin Harvick   Tony s career  I look at on paper and he s my true hero as far as what he s been able to do   fellow inductee Labonte said of his former teammate  After becoming the first driver to earn all three of USAC s top championships    in Midgets  Silver Crown and Sprint Cars    then taking the IndyCar title in 1997  Stewart was ready and primed to give NASCAR a real go  Although he had plenty of credibility and a long resume already    Stewart actually began his Cup career after only 36 sporadic starts over three seasons in the Xfinity Series  some of that time overlapping with his IndyCar schedule  The open wheel master did not win a race in a stock car while learning the new craft in the Xfinity Series    although he had a pair of runner up finishes at Rockingham  N C   and New Hampshire in 1998  His natural talent and ability to learn quickly  however  provided all the promise and confidence Gibbs needed to give Stewart a shot in NASCAR s big leagues  Stewart made his Cup Series debut in 1999  And never disappointed  He earned 15 top 10 finishes in his first 24 Cup races and then put an exclamation point on that first year effort with a win at Richmond  Va   in only his 25th start    leading a dominating 333 of the race s 400 laps  With the incredible effort  he became the first Cup Series rookie to win a race since Davey Allison more than a decade  1987  earlier  He answered his maiden win with back to back victories at races at Phoenix Raceway and Homestead Miami Speedway that November to close out the stunning rookie campaign  He became the first Cup Series rookie to win three races    a mark he and seven time Cup champion Jimmie Johnson  2002  still share today  The next season  2000  going door to door with other NASCAR Hall of Famers such as seven time champion Dale Earnhardt  Terry Labonte  Ricky Rudd  Rusty Wallace and Dale Jarrett  Stewart went on to win a career high single season total of six races as his Joe Gibbs teammate and fellow 2020 Hall of Fame inductee Labonte won the Cup title  Two years later    in 2002    Stewart was hoisting his first Cup championship trophy and added another in 2005  He had won 24 Cup Series races in just those first six seasons  It was a time of great success and happiness for Stewart  who today readily recognizes how special it is for him to be inducted right alongside his former team owner  Gibbs   teammate  Labonte  and former Xfinity Series crew chief  Wilson   He even attended the Buck Baker Driving School and recalls having Buddy Baker on site during his beginnings in a stock car    so this year s class feels particularly familiar and esteemed to him  As with another NASCAR Hall of Famer  Jeff Gordon  Stewart s presence and success in NASCAR helped people look at the sport differently  And it opened up a broad spectrum of career possibilities for drivers  From off road racer Jimmie Johnson to fellow USAC driver Kasey Kahne  who soon became stars as well  Stewart trailblazed an unexpected opportunity   It was such an honor  from where I come from  racing with him   Johnson said   Finding drivers that had a non traditional route to NASCAR  those guys were a notch up for me  I can recall going and watching Tony race a midget at Ventura  Raceway   I was probably 16 or 17 years old  so it goes way back knowing who he was and watching his career in IndyCar  And then to go toe to toe with him was a huge honor   Johnson also acknowledged the honor of racing Stewart was simultaneously one of the biggest championship challenges he faced in his own decorated career   At times I knew I could frustrate him and use that to my advantage   Johnson said with a slight laugh   But the bulk of the time  I knew I had to be on my game  I mean the guy s tenacious  If you left the slightest opening  he was going to take it   I just respected that and enjoyed it  I knew in the day  when that orange hood was coming  plus I had the  competing sponsor  pressure of Lowe s versus  Home Depot   NYSE HD   I knew when that orange hood was coming  I was fighting for my life   The harder they raced  the closer they actually became as friends  Their sponsors were direct competitors and Johnson and Stewart were deciding Cup Series titles year after year after year  But the respect they gained    on and off track    has been life lasting   We were expected to be such fierce rivals that we joked about it and kinda formed a friendship off of it   Johnson said   On my side  I just always felt when we would have a few beers and have a chance to connect  He really valued my opinion and being a young guy new to the sport trying to find my way  to have somebody really listen was new for me and really special to me in ways  This is Tony Stewart and he s really listening to me  So  for me  maybe that was the start of it   As the seasons went on  Stewart developed a reputation similar to his racing idol  the legendary A J  Foyt  He was uber talented  but also no nonsense on the track  And highly spirited  He left nothing on the table  in regard to his feelings  Emotion was as much a part of Stewart s presence as was his great talent to wheel any type of car to victory  At times  it appeared any perceived conflict or underestimation seemed to energize Stewart  This champion  underdog  was perhaps most threatening in that he was a master of surpassing expectation  It was something he learned early in his life  overcoming and exceeding a lot of expectation as he made his way up the ranks in the USAC classes  He earned a shot in racing s big time because of his immense talent  never because of a fat family checkbook  And that grit and gumption was on full display in his incredible 2011 championship run  After being winless the entire 26 race regular season  Stewart reeled off victories in the first two Playoff races at Chicago and New Hampshire    his third season in the dual role of driver and team owner  A month later  he won back to back races at Martinsville  Va   and Texas Motor Speedway and showed up at Homestead Miami Speedway for the championship race a mere three points behind Carl Edwards  The two had fun in the week leading up to the championship finale dropping verbal barbs like a pair of boxers before the championship fight  And as compelling a storyline as they created leading into the race  the race itself proved to be unlike any other NASCAR title event previously or since  Twice the race was stopped for rain and Stewart s No  14 Ford had to overcome a couple of mechanical issues that arose  But he took the lead on the final restart and held point for 36 laps  beating Edwards to the line by 1 306 seconds  The one two result meant the two drivers were technically tied in points  However  Stewart had won five races and Edwards had only one trophy meaning the title went to Stewart by tiebreaker  It s the only time in NASCAR history the points standings finished in a tie  That dramatic and compelling championship run remains the most memorable for Stewart   So many things happened that night   Stewart said  recalling the challenges   All the things that happened were setbacks and to be able to come back from that  That s definitely the highlight for me   Stewart closed his Cup driving career out in 2016 in a fitting manner    earning a win in his last season with a last lap pass on the Sonoma  Calif   road course  He finished with 49 victories and 308 top 10 finishes in 618 starts    a hefty 50 percent of the time he suited up  he finished in the top 10  Stewart remains a very engaged team owner    having won a title with Harvick  And fittingly  his team is perpetually championship eligible  challenging for NASCAR trophies while its namesake continues to suit up in short tracks across the country    finishing his driving career right where he started it  But with a whole lot of success in between   Not many people are still doing what they love to do and getting inducted in the Hall of Fame at the same time   Stewart acknowledged  
But Tony Stewart is  And he did it his way    By Holly Cain  NASCAR Wire Service  Special to Field Level Media ",2020-01-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/nascar-hall-of-fame-to-honor-stewarts-love-of-racing-2071046,2071046
161959,383475,HD,Tesla directors settle  isolating Musk as SolarCity trial looms,news,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON  Del   Reuters    Directors of Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  Inc settled a shareholder lawsuit over the company s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity Corp  leaving Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk as the lone defendant facing claims that Tesla paid  2 6 billion for a worthless solar energy system installer  according to court documents 
The  60 million settlement comes as a 10 day trial is scheduled to start on March 16 in Delaware in which shareholders seek  2 6 billion in damages  the entire cost of the SolarCity deal 
A lawyer for Musk and a spokesman for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Tesla shareholders have alleged Musk breached his fiduciary duties  squandered Tesla s assets and unjustly enriched himself by pushing to buy the money losing solar company in which he was the biggest investor 
The settlement covered five current directors  Robyn Denholm  Ira Ehrenpreis  Antonio Gracias  Stephen Jurvetson and Kimbal Musk  Brad Buss  who was a director at the time of the SolarCity deal  was also part of the settlement  which was paid from insurance policies  according to court documents 
 Plaintiffs probably think they have a cleaner shot on the merits if the only issues they have to raise are with Elon Musk and Elon Musk s actions   said Brian Quinn  a professor at Boston College Law School 
The case was brought in the Court of Chancery in Delaware  where Tesla is incorporated  by an individual investor and five investment funds 
Tesla said in a statement to Reuters in September the allegations were  based on the claims of plaintiff s lawyers looking for a payday  and are not representative of our shareholders  
The suit represents another legal headache for Musk  who in the past two years has settled a lawsuit by securities regulators over his use of Twitter and won a defamation trial brought by a British cave explorer 
Musk and the Tesla board also are scheduled to defend Musk s pay package at a trial in Delaware next year 
At the heart of the current case are allegations that Musk and the other board members did not fully disclose the depth of SolarCity s problems  or their own conflicts 
SolarCity was founded in 2006 by Musk and his cousins  Lyndon Rive and Peter Rive  who were the company s CEO and chief technology officer as well as directors  Musk was SolarCity s chairman and largest shareholder  and five of Tesla s directors were direct or indirect owners of SolarCity stock 
Entering 2016  SolarCity s stock was on a sharp downward trajectory and the company was slashing its workforce and bleeding cash 
Tesla touted synergies of combining the companies in the all stock deal  which was approved by Tesla shareholders 
After the deal closed  Tesla slashed its solar sales force and ended a solar marketing deal with  Home Depot  Inc  NYSE HD   Quarterly solar installations plummeted and are well below levels SolarCity enjoyed in its heyday 
Tesla has said Musk s involvement in deal discussions and all other material information were accurately described to shareholders in public filings before the deal closed 






On Wednesday  Tesla reported its second straight quarterly profit  sending its stock surging to an all time high ",2020-01-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/tesla-directors-settle-isolating-musk-as-solarcity-trial-looms-2072029,2072029
161960,383476,HD,Is Home Depot Stock a Buy ,news,"Home Depot s  NYSE HD  share price has increased by 24 3  over the last year  and 118 4  over the last five years  Operating more than 2 200 stores in the U S   Canada  and Mexico that average 105 000 square feet of shopping space  Home Depot has grown immensely since the first two stores opened in 1979  
Taking a look at revenue growth and profitability  dividend sustainability  and share price valuation  we can better determine if Home Depot is a buy  hold  or sell for a long term investment horizon 
Revenue growth and profitability
Home Depot has shown impressive revenue growth over the last five years  rising from  83 2 billion in 2015 to  108 2 billion in 2019    generating a 5 4  compound annual growth rate  CAGR  
The impressive revenue growth can partially be attributed to the integration of both physical and online sales  which management calls One Home Depot    a term originally coined by the company in 2017 which involved investing  5 4 billion into e commerce  store improvements  and enhancing the distribution system   

A 2019 Investor and Analyst Conference announced updates to the strategy which included  integrating e commerce solutions  enhancing the stores to increase convenience and decrease shopping time  increasing delivery options  and integrating a Pro ecosystem 
Craig Menear  Home Depot s chairman  CEO  and president  stated during the conference that  we re confident that the investments we are making in the One Home Depot experience will address the evolving needs of our customers  

Profit margins have been impressive alongside revenue  specifically net profit margin  Growing from 7 6  net income margin to 10 3  over the past five years gives Home Depot increasing profitability while gross profit margins have stayed relatively flat at 34  over the same time period  This gain in net profit is a reflection of the integration initiatives increasing the company s efficiency 
A growing dividend and share buybacks
Home Depot s dividend has been growing for over 10 years  with a five year CAGR of 23 7   Currently  the forward dividend yield is 2 4   The company s payout ratio    the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends    is 54   which leaves plenty of room for dividend growth in the future 
Total debt has increased at a 3  CAGR over the last five years  from  17 2 billion in 2015 to  29 2 billion in 2019  However  total common shares outstanding have been decreasing at a 3 3  CAGR over the same period  which has increased shareholder value from shareholder repurchases    with over  38 billion in shares repurchased over five years and a total shareholder payback of over  56 billion in dividends and share repurchases  
Home Depot is growing and properly valued
Shares of Home Depot are currently trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 22 7  which is above Home Depot s direct competitor Lowe s  NYSE LOW  P E ratio of 20 4  Home Depot s price to sales ratio of 2 26 is above Lowe s 1 27  but Home Depot beats Lowe s on revenue growth  EBITDA growth  and earnings per share growth    showing a proper valuation based on the fundamentals over Lowe s 
Home Depot s management expects growth to continue in 2020  with comparable store sales gains forecast between 3 5  and 4  in comparison to 2019 s 3 5   Because of heavy investments into Home Depot One  operating margins are expected to be 14  rather than 2019 s 15   However  investors should see the results of the investments over the long term 
Overall  Home Depot s growth  profitability  dividend sustainability  and share price valuation make Home Depot a good investment into 2020  and a buy at the current valuation 
Assuming the economy does not fall into a recession  Home Depot s revenue can be expected to continue the 5  CAGR    continually benefiting shareholders with dividends and share repurchases ",2020-02-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psgm5,2079164

161987,383503,HD,Flare up of Sino U S  tensions over Hong Kong knocks world shares off 22 month high,news,"By Sujata Rao
LONDON  Reuters    World stocks were knocked off 22 month highs on Wednesday as a renewed flare up in Sino U S  tensions and the creeping return of U S  recession fears fueled a bid for bonds and other  safe  assets such as gold 
European equities tumbled half a percent at the open  edging further off recent four year highs hit when it had appeared Washington and Beijing were about to agree the first phase of a trade deal  Wall Street futures were marked lower while oil prices suffered their biggest daily loss in seven weeks 
The mood in markets soured after the U S  Senate angered China by passing a bill requiring annual certification of Hong Kong s autonomy and warning Beijing against violently suppressing protesters  China demanded the United States stop interfering in its internal affairs and said it would retaliate 
U S  President Donald Trump also threatened to up tariffs on Chinese goods if a trade deal is not reached soon 
 Markets have taken a bit of a wobble due to the talk about Hong Kong  but they had rallied a lot in recent weeks on expectations of a  trade  deal   said Salman Ahmed  chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier 
Ahmed said both sides needed a deal to be signed    Trump cannot afford a recession because of his re election bid next year  while China s economy is slowing markedly 
 I think we are looking at a short term setback rather than a major issue that would derail the process  The bill still has to be signed into law by Trump so there s a high probability he will use it as leverage against China

U S  shares closed just below record highs on Tuesday  however  and world stocks remain just 0 5  off all time peaks hit last year 
 It was noticeable that fixed income markets rallied despite equity markets being stable  suggestive of a market that remains cautious about the growth outlook   ANZ told clients 
U S  10 year Treasury yields  which have fallen in six out of the past seven sessions  slipped 5 basis points to 1 735   a 2 1 2  week low  US10YT RR  
German bonds fell for the third straight day to touch a 2 1 2 week low  DE10YT RR   shrugging off European Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane s comment that the euro zone economy would not fall into a recession 
 It s all about sentiment on trade     We have this classical risk off trade taking place again   Rainer Guntermann  a rates strategist at Commerzbank  DE CBKG   said 
THE R WORD
Moves on commodity prices and bond markets imply fears of economic recession may be creeping back 
Japan s October exports fanned those fears further  tumbling at their quickest rate in three years  with shipments to China and the United States suffering big falls 
U S  crude stocks rose far more than expected  the American Petroleum Institute said  driving Brent crude  LCOc1  into a 2 6  slide  Brent fell another half percent  inching towards the  60 mark last breached three weeks ago 
A marked flattening of the curve    the gap between two year and 10 year yields is at its narrowest in more than two weeks    also hints at a return of recession fears  The curve inverted earlier this year  returning to normal only after three U S  interest rate cuts 
But Federal Reserve officials have hinted there will be no further easing for now  a message the U S  central bank may reiterate later in the day when it releases minutes from its last meeting  Markets are now pricing in just a 0 8  chance of a December rate cut  
Dour forecasts from retailers  Home Depot   NYSE HD  and Kohl s also fueled worries about U S  consumer spending  which has so far been extremely robust  in contrast to manufacturing

162008,383524,HD,Home Depot cuts sales goal as online push not delivering as expected,news,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
 Reuters     Home Depot  Inc  N HD  said on Tuesday the marriage of its online and brick and mortar businesses was not yet generating as much revenue as it had expected  prompting the retailer to cut its 2019 sales forecast for the second time this year 
Shares of the largest U S  home improvement chain  which have risen nearly 40  this year  fell 4 5  to  228 in premarket trading 
To keep customers away from smaller rival Lowe s Cos Inc  N LOW   Home Depot invested heavily in its online business  primarily by adding automated lockers in stores for shoppers who want to pick up their orders rather than wait for them to be delivered 
The service  known as  click and collect   aims to draw in consumers who are generally wary of ordering expensive building materials or appliances without in store advice on their installation and use 
Home Depot has also worked on its supply network to shorten delivery times and developed a more user friendly website  under a program called  One Home Depot   first announced in December 2017 
At the time  Home Depot said the initiatives were aimed at increasing its sales by up to 6  to  120 billion by 2020  while still keeping its operating margins  flattish  
 We are largely on track with these investments and have seen positive results  but some of the benefits anticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial assumptions   Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said in a statement 
Home Depot said it expected its fiscal 2019 sales to rise about 1 8   compared to a prior forecast of a 2 3  increase  The new forecast implies revenue of  110 15 billion 
 This report could suggest that Lowe s is having a good time going after Home Depot s dominance   OANDA Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya said  Lowe s is due to report its third quarter results on Wednesday 
The company had previously cut its full year sales forecast in August due to falling lumber prices as well as the anticipated impact new U S  tariffs on Chinese imports would have on consumer demand 
Same store sales at Home Depot rose 3 6  in the third quarter ended Nov  3  below expectations of a 4 7  increase  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
Home Depot s weak results also pulled shares of Lowe s down nearly 3  in premarket trading

All that noted   tis  all in  with respect to stocks  As updated daily  here from the website is the S P 500 s points change  red line  from three months ago to date along with its moneyflow  blue line  regressed into S P points such that it is presented on the same scale  From the time the worksheet that drives this graphic was created back in 2005  we don t recall ever having seen this tight a fit between the S P and its moneyflow   Tis one substantive up move for stocks 
 







However  lacking upside substance is the current state of the precious metals   Baby Blues   that key metric we use to measure the consistency of a market s linear regression trend  Here is the two panel display of daily bars from three months ago to date for Gold on the left and Silver on the right  both markets seeing their blue dots waning from their recent tracks of rising  Still  such state doesn t mitigate this missive s thrust that Gold is targeting 1500 into year end  but the respective prices for both metals certainly during the last several weeks have hardly driven up straight roads 







Fortunately  those roads are reinforced with trading support as shown by the 10 day Market Profiles for both Gold  left  and Silver  right   The yellow metal has built in a contract volume base throughout the 1470s  the white metal less so with a fairly glowing gaposis sub 16 95 down to volume support at 16 65  Still  Gold s higher glide ought to directionally pull Sister Silver alongside   especially given the alarmingly high Gold Silver ratio of 87 1x  







For our analytical wrap  here next is The Gold Stack     and note its top line so very near a major millennia milestone   nudge nudge  hint hint  elbow elbow

Home Depot
 Home Depot  Inc  NYSE HD  shares initially plummeted 5  following the release of their disappointing earnings report   Earnings per share came in a cent higher than expected but both revenue and same store sales growth missed expectations  The home improvement store also slashed their comparable sales and revenue outlooks for the rest of the year   Last quarter s earnings report came out right around investor expectations  but many would say it was better than feared as concerns grow that competition is eating away at their market share   This report could suggest that Lowe s Companies Inc  NYSE LOW  is having a good time going after Home Depot s dominance   Lowes will report on Wednesday  their shares are also under pressure this morning   Dow futures gave up early gains following the Home Depot results

162074,383590,HD,Strong 30 Day Charts And Contributions From Tech And Communication Services  Technically Speaking ,opinion,"Summary
Homebuilders are feeling very confident China is cutting rates The upward trend continues Homebuilders are feeling   emphasis added  

Builder confidence in the market for newly built single family homes edged one point lower to 70 in November  according to the latest National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo Housing Market Index  HMI  released today  The past two months mark the highest sentiment levels in 2019 
 Single family builders are currently reporting ongoing positive conditions  spurred in part by low mortgage rates and continued job growth   said NAHB Chairman Greg Ugalde  a home builder and developer from Torrington  Conn   In a further sign of solid demand  this is the fourth consecutive month where at least half of all builders surveyed have reported positive buyer traffic conditions  
The fundamental backdrop is positive  unemployment is low  wages are rising  the stock market is near highs  which increases confidence   and rates are low  As a result  new home sales are just shy of 12 month highs as are existing home sales 
China is   emphasis added  
China s central bank has lowered its new benchmark lending rates in a bid to guide borrowing costs down as the economy expands at its slowest pace in decades 
The People s Bank of China set the one year Loan Prime Rate  the new reference rate replacing the previous benchmark interest rates  at 4 25  on Tuesday  down from 4 31  before  The LPR is also below the one year benchmark lending rate that now stands at 4 35  

While most countries would be envious of China s macroeconomic statistics  most have been trending lower  including GDP growth  retail sales  and industrial production  On the plus side  the manufacturing PMI recently turned positive and the service sector is still expanding  However  this drop means the central bank is concerned enough about downside risks to lower rates 

Is the latest yield curve inversion  normal  or  abnormal   Work by Kim Kowalewski posted over  argues it s  normal   The author plotted the total changes in the 3 month and 10 year Treasuries on a scatterplot 




The current episode is located where most of the other inversions are  making this episode more  normal   Here s the author s conclusion  emphasis added  
The second point is that the change in the 10 year Note during the latest episode  point labeled  1612 1908   is close to the estimated relationship  In other words  the change in the 10 year Note rate during the latest inversion doesn t appear to be unusual given the change in the 3 month Bill rate  It s true that the 10 year Note rate declined during the recent episode  but it also declined during the other episodes since the late 1980s  The finding suggests that the unusual factors cited earlier did not have much of an impact on the change in the 10 year Note rate in the latest episode or were offset by other factors 
Food for thought 
Let s turn to today s performance table 









A bit of an odd day  The top four spots were inter mixed with small cap stocks and long end Treasuries    definitely a market odd couple  The biggest equity winner was up 0 56   the second best performer gained 0 37   Large cap stocks were trading right around 0   making the day an overall wash for them  
Sector performance is also mixed  with the top four spots inter mixed between defensive and aggressive sectors  The two worst performers were consumer discretionary    which was hit by negative news from  Home Depot   NYSE HD     and the energy sector 
Overall  however  the underlying  30 day trend is still positive 





The iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  is up about 7 points since mid October  Prices formed a counter trend consolidating pattern between November 5 and 15  but resumed their move higher today  Notice the 200 minute EMA  which has been in a consistent uptrend for the entire period 





The Invesco QQQ Trust  NASDAQ QQQ  is also in a solid and consistent uptrend  as is    





    the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   which has formed three separate uptrends since November 18 

Just as importantly  the largest sectors of the SPY have also been moving higher 










Technology has a very bullish chart  Not only is the 200 minute EMA moving higher  but so are the 10  20  and 50 minute EMAs  Overall  tech is up about 10  





Financials are also moving higher but in a far more inconsistent manner  Still  they re up about 10  in the last 30 days 

Telecommunication services also have a consistent and strong uptrend in place  They re up about 5  
The bulls are still in charge  The indexes are moving higher  today led by small caps  The aggressive sectors are contributing to gains while also having solid  short term charts ",2019-11-20,Hale Stewart,https://www.investing.com/analysis/strong-30day-charts-and-contributions-from-tech-and-communication-services-technically-speaking-200486550,200486550

 Reuters    Lowe s Cos Inc  N LOW  shares surged over 11  on Wednesday as the home improvement chain s efforts to focus on higher spending customers helped it beat quarterly profit estimates and gain ground on larger rival  Home Depot  Inc  N HD  
Like Home Depot  Lowe s has been chasing plumbers  builders and carpenters who spend more than its core  do it yourself  shoppers  by stocking up on higher end industrial products such as drills and power saws 
Home Depot also beat quarterly profit estimates on Tuesday buoyed by sales of big ticket items  but warned that the U S  China trade drama would impact consumer demand and cut its full year sales forecast 
Lowe s said the potential impact of U S  tariffs on some Chinese imports set to take effect from Sept  1 was baked in its full year earnings forecast of  5 45 to  5 65 per share  which the company reaffirmed on Wednesday 
Lowe s has also modified certain sections in stores dedicating them specifically to higher spending customers with staff  billing and parking facilities  Changes in its supply chain and a new merchandising team have helped keep in demand products in stock for longer 
Lowe s total average bill amount rose 3 2  to  77 97 in the quarter 
 Under Ellison  retail basics such as in stocks  merchandising and customer service are all being improved   Neil Saunders  managing director of GlobalData Retail said 
Marvin Ellison  who was the chief executive officer of J C  Penney Co Inc  N JCP  before taking the top job at Lowe s last year  has made these changes with his sights squarely set on closing the gap with Home Depot  the United States  largest home improvement chain 
Lowe s same store sales growth outpaced Home Depot in the country for the second straight quarter  something that helped push the company s shares higher  according to Stifel analyst John Baugh 
For an interactive graphic on Lowe s U S  same store sales compared to Home Depot over the last three years  click here    
However  Lowe s overall quarterly net sales of  20 99 billion  hurt by a drop in revenue from Canadian stores  was still about  10 billion shy of Home Depot s figure 
Lowe s executives added rising home prices were leading consumers to spend on renovations and upgrades to their existing homes  rather than investing in new properties  benefiting home improvement chains

162134,383650,HD,S P 500 Weekly Earnings Update  Might Be Quiet Till December 2019,opinion,"Per IBES  461 of the S P 500 have reported their Q3  19 results 
We continue to lap toughest quarter of 2018 in terms of quarterly earnings  as Q3  18 saw S P 500 EPS grow 28  and S P 500 revenue grow 8 6   Q4  19 compare s do get a little easier 
Note how strong Q3 and Q4  18 S P 500 earnings and revenue growth were at the end of last year  and yet that was the peak in the S P 500  late September  18 anyway  as the S P 500 lost 13  in Q4  18 and 4 5  in calendar  18  after the strongest earnings growth in years 
So much for S P 500 earnings analysis being a good market timing tool 
The point in writing this is that readers may not realize the tough  comps   i e  compare  the S P 500 has faced all year and will still do so in Q4  19 just to a lesser degree 
Also note the sharp deceleration in S P 500 earnings growth in Q4  18 versus Q3  18 
This coming week  Home Depot   NYSE HD  and Lowe s Companies  NYSE LOW  and general merchandise retailers report  Housing stocks have been robust for most of  19 and since the FOMC started cutting rates in late July  19  Let s see if Home Depot and Lowe s reflect that resurgence 
One last chart 





Note the  expected  revenue growth rates for 2020  which are lower than 2019 s actual rates for all but the 4th quarter of 2020 
Expected S P 500 EPS growth rates for the first half of 2020 are still below the long run average of 7   but the 2nd half of 2020 is expected to be more robust  however  all these estimates will change over the next few months 
Summary   Conclusion  In December  19 we will start to hear from companies like FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX   Oracle  NYSE ORCL  and numerous others with a November quarter end  which will give us our first tangible glimpse into Q4  19 earnings outside of recent guidance 
For the next two   three weeks  earnings reports will likely have little influence on the market with 461 of the S P 500 having already reported Q3  19 
There is more earnings related importance at the company level rather than the macro level at this point  hence  the struggle to find something both interesting and relevant to write about 
Remember  companies like FedEx  and Oracle  and others that report their quarter in December will be lapping some of their worst compares in years  Some of December  18 s earnings reports were ugly ",2019-11-17,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-weekly-earnings-update-might-be-quiet-till-december-2019-200485813,200485813

Xinhua  China s state news service reported yesterday  that the two countries had  constructive talks   on Saturday  However  no agreement was finalized though the two sides   agreed to maintain close communication   
Beyond the macro risks  there are still some big earnings announcements ahead during the coming week  especially from a variety of large retail companies  We re keeping a close eye on the following three stocks 
1   Home Depot  
The hardware and household improvement chain  Home Depot  NYSE HD   will be reporting third quarter earnings on Tuesday  Nov  19  before the open  On average  analysts expect  2 52 a share profit on sales of  27 53 billion 
The world s largest home improvement chain has pursued a variety of successful strategies during the past few years  to fuel growth and benefit from strong consumer spending  In the second quarter  however  Home Depot failed to impress investors when it lowered its sales forecast  warning that falling lumber prices as well as the potential effects of tariffs on U S  consumers could weigh on growth 

After a remarkable run over the past five years  during which Home Depot shares  which closed at  237 29 on Friday  gained more than 142   the stock didn t participate in the market s most recent run up during the past month  However  if falling U S  mortgage rates help fuel home sales and renovation spending  Home Depot s winning streak could still continue

Salesforce com  NYSE CRM   which sells software and cloud based services to corporate clients  will be having its annual investor day on Wednesday  Nov  20  amid optimism on the company s business direction and growth strategy 
In its most recent earnings report in August  Salesforce provided a revenue forecast that topped Wall Street s estimates  signaling that the San Francisco based company will continue to see rapid growth 





Revenue is expected to be as much as  4 45 billion in the period ending in October  helped by the company s latest acquisitions  Indeed  in August  Salesforce closed its biggest deal ever  purchasing Tableau Software for  15 3 billion and announcing an agreement to acquire ClickSoftware Technologies Inc  for  1 35 billion 
Salesforce shares closed at  163 21 on Friday  after rising 19  this year

162138,383654,HD,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Home Depot to Hammer out Earnings
  Home Depot    NYSE HD  is set to release earnings before the opening bell Tuesday  
Ahead of the report  analysts have weighed the impact of tariffs  which has increased raw materials costs such as lumber  against supportive factors such as lower mortgage rates and a healthy consumer  
  W e are concerned somewhat that seemingly transitory factors might have impacted modestly sales trends  particularly early in the period  second quarter    Oppenheimer said   
But the underlying drivers  appear to remain in place  and could re strengthen  given a recent plunge in mortgage rates  moderating  albeit still climbing home values  and overall healthy consumer indicators   it added  
Home Depot is expected to report earnings of  3 09 per share on revenue of  31 06 billion 
As well as earnings  guidance will also draw close scrutiny after the home improvement retailer s previous outlook in the first quarter fell short of expectations 
 Home Depot   NYSE HD  shares are up 2 75  in August and 21  on the year 
Rival Lowe s  NYSE LOW  reports earnings a day later on Wednesday 
2  Fed Vice Chairman Quarles in Spotlight 
The economic data slate for Tuesday is light  with a speech from Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Randal Quarles due at 1 PM ET  17 00 GMT   
Quarles speaks Tuesday at an event in Utah on community development   
The speech comes ahead of the minutes of the July 30 31 Federal Open Market Committee meeting scheduled for Wednesday and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speech in Jackson Hole  Wyo   on Friday 
The minutes  due Wednesday  will likely be parsed for signs that Fed members are increasingly leaning more dovish  raising the odds of a rate cut at their meeting next month 
3  API Crude Inventories

162161,383677,HD,Home Depot  HD  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Home Depot  NYSE HD  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 19  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This home improvement retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 52 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 4  
Revenues are expected to be  27 48 billion  up 4 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Home Depot 
For Home Depot  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Home Depot will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Home Depot would post earnings of  3 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 17  delivering a surprise of  3 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Home Depot doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-11-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/home-depot-hd-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200484684,200484684
162162,383678,HD,Home Depot To Report Q3 Earnings  Will The Growth Pick Up Again  ,opinion,"Home Depot   NYSE HD   will report its third quarter performance before the opening bell on Tuesday  November 19  The home improvement company has seen its shares rise over 38  in 2019 and is currently hovering just below its 52 week high of  238 99  Home Depot has stoked investors over the past few quarters where it gained market share and steadily increased its profitability 
However  the firm s Q2 report highlighted slowing revenue growth and provided a cautious forward guidance  The company is looking for a strong quarter that can send it soaring to new highs  Let s take a closer look at the business and how it might come out of the gates for Q3 
Overview 
Home Depot reported sluggish comp sales over the past six months  which exacerbated worries about the negative impact the trade war would have on the company  In addition  an unusually wet month of May combined with lumber price inflation pressured the reported results  Investors are now expecting an uptick in comp sales this quarter to hopefully make up for the sluggish growth in the second quarter 
Wall Street is hoping that the issues that hindered Home Depot s Q2 performance aren t permanent and just a minor roadblock on its growth runway  Investors are also expecting Home Depot to continue with its strong capital returns  CEO Craig Menear and his team are expecting to spend at least  2 5 billion on share repurchases in the second half of 2019 to bring annual buybacks up to  5 billion 
Home Depot executives also said last quarter that the fundamentals of the industry  including rising home prices and wages  are still pointing to more growth ahead  This comment suggests that management s wary forward guidance may have just been precautionary to the volatile macroeconomic issues 
Outlook 
With the macroeconomic issues still not completely settled  should investors overlook the unresolved issues plaguing Home Depot  White House economic advisor  Larry Kudlow  announced on Friday that the US and China are getting close to finally reaching a trade deal that would put an end to the market shaking skirmish  The announcement provided some light at the end of the tunnel for companies like Home Dept who have had their operations weighed down by the conflict 
Investors this week will find out whether management still has the confidence it projected back in August when it said that all the  building blocks of the financial model remain in place   Investors should look at metrics like customer traffic  sales growth  and gross profit margin that are indicative of the overall strength of the company s operations 
Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast a bottom line gain of 0 4  to  2 52 per share and a top line climb of 4 33  to  27 44 billion  Comp sales for the third quarter are projected to come in at 3 9  and the average ticket is forecasted to rise 5 18  to  68 48  Looking ahead to Home Depot s full fiscal year  our estimates predict a 2 33  jump in earnings to  10 12 per share and net sales growth of 2 25  to  110 64 billion 
Bottom Line  
Home Depot needs to report a solid performance in the third quarter to reassure Wall Street after the trade war hindered the company s performance and overall outlook  We ll get a good idea how Home Depot chose to navigate the rough macroeconomic landscape when the company reports its gross and operating profit margins on Tuesday 
If the home improvement giant reports a strong quarter that was able to mitigate the volatile macroeconomic environment  a new high can surely be in the cards for HD stock  For those feeling especially bullish about the company  Home Depot has accelerated its dividend payout by 444  since 2011  which can anchor shareholders if sluggish growth were to continue  Home Depot s estimate revisions have trended higher  earning HD a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

162191,383707,HD,Builders FirstSource  BLDR  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Shares of Builders FirstSource  BLDR  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 16 7  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  24 78 in the previous session  Builders FirstSource has gained 118 2  since the start of the year compared to the 23 2  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 33 3  return for the Zacks Building Products   Retail industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 31  2019  Builders FirstSource reported EPS of  0 72 versus consensus estimate of  0 6 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 6 32  
For the current fiscal year  Builders FirstSource is expected to post earnings of  1 98 per share on  7 23 billion in revenues  This represents a 4 21  change in EPS on a  6 36  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 12 per share on  7 58 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 6 9  and 4 78   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Builders FirstSource may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Builders FirstSource has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 12X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 8 4X versus its peer group s average of 9X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Builders FirstSource currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Builders FirstSource passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Builders FirstSource shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Builders FirstSource Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Builders FirstSource have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including BMC Stock Holdings  BMCH   Lowe s Companies  NYSE LOW   and The Home Depot  NYSE HD   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 26  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Builders FirstSource  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-11-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/builders-firstsource-bldr-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200482858,200482858

162258,383774,HD,Home Depot Slumps 3  on Profit Miss  Forecast for Slowing Sales,news,"Investing com   Shares of  Home Depot   NYSE HD  fell around 3  in premarket trade Tuesday after it reported worse than expected profit for the fourth quarter and gave a disappointing outlook for the current year 
The home improvement retailer booked a pre tax charge of  247 million against its Interline Brands business  and also reported a rise of only 3 2  in comparable store sales for the quarter  falling below the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 4 5  
It said comparable sales growth this year would be around 5   down from 5 2  in fiscal 2018 
However  the company also raised its quarterly dividend by 32  to  1 36 a share  and said it had authorized a new  15 billion stock buyback program  It expects to execute around a third of that in fiscal 2019 
The Dow component reported diluted earnings per share of  2 09 on sales of  26 5 billion  Analysts polled by Investing com expected EPS of  2 16 on revenue of  26 58 billion  The Interline impairment knocked 16c off diluted earnings per share 
Concerns over the strength of the U S  housing market have weighed on Home Depot  as home price growth has slowed and existing home sales have stagnated  Home builder confidence fell to a three and half year low in December due to higher mortgage rates and some fear the softening market could be an early indicator of a broader slowdown  
The stalled housing market has some investors wondering if home improvement projects will also decline  which could hit Home Depot s bottom line over the next year  
Home Depot follows other major Services sector earnings this month

162259,383775,HD,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Norwegian Cruise  Royal Caribbean  Lowe s  Home Depot And Owens,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  September 6  2019   Zacks com announces

OC   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog How Stocks Have Been Reacting to Dorian s ImpactAfter ravaging the Bahamas  Hurricane Dorian is all set to unleash its fury on East Coast the United States on Sep 5  This event in turn has impacted several industries While shares of cruise companies and hotels fell as tourism stalled  insurance shares dropped as the companies had to release funds for damage relief  Meanwhile  shares of building materials  freights and home improvement products rose as demand for such products increased due to the property damage in wake of a hurricane Tracking Hurricane DorianAfter wreaking havoc in the Bahamas  Hurricane Dorian shifted its course toward the coast of Florida on Sep 3  The hurricane had weakened after hitting the Bahamas but has since gained strength  recording maximum wind speeds of 115mph On Sep 4  the National Hurricane Center  NHC  reported that Dorian has been upgraded to Category 3 and is shifting north toward the coasts of Georgia  South Carolina and North Carolina accompanied by strong winds  heavy rains  and high storm surges  Per NHC  Dorian is the most powerful storm to hit the Atlantic since 1935 Labor Day hurricane The increase in Dorian s strength has raised the risk of storm hazards  The storm is anticipated to hit South Carolina coastline by Sep 5 and move toward North Carolina making landfall in the first half of Sep 6 Dorian has hurricane force winds extending outward more than 60 miles from the center and a wind force that extend outward up to 195 miles  If Dorian makes a landfall in North Carolina it will be the first Category 3 hurricane to strike since Hurricane Fran in 1996 How the Stocks Reacted to Hurricane Dorian s Impact Northern Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama has suffered severe damage due to Dorian  In fact  according to the International Red Cross more than 13 000 properties are either damaged or destroyed Without a doubt  travel and tourism industry which includes hotels and cruises bore the brunt of Hurricane Dorian  Shares of both Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd dropped nearly 2  on Sep 3 as the companies have multiple cruise ship destinations at The Bahamas At the same time  the overall insurance industry has also suffered due to the hurricane  Per analysts at Swiss investment bank UBS Group AG  insurance companies collectively will incur a loss of at least  25 billion owing to Dorian But shares of building supplies  home improvement and freight industries gained as Dorian left behind damaged properties  which raised demand for their products and shipments Shares of both Lowe s Companies  Inc  and Home Depot Inc rose 0 7  on Sep 4  Also shares of building supplies like Owens Corning rose 0 5  on the same

162260,383776,HD,High Costs Mar Building Products   Retail Industry Prospects,opinion,The  industry comprises of U S  home improvement retailers  manufactures of industrial and construction materials and distributors of wallboard and ceilings systems  Some of the industry participants also offer products and services for home decoration  repair and remodeling  and in home delivery and installation services The industry players provide a wide array of products ranging from cement or concrete foundation materials to roofing boards and shingles  The companies also sell lumber  insulation materials  drywall  plumbing fixtures  hard surface flooring  lawn and garden  and decor products  Some players also deal in threaded fastener products  and manufactured and natural stone tiles  The industry players cater to professional homebuilders  sub contractors  remodelers and consumers Let s have a look at the industry s three major themes Sentiments regarding the U S  housing market are mixed at the moment  Despite low mortgage rates  buyers remain cautious regarding the long term commitment of house purchases  Per sources  consumer sentiment in housing improved in August  however  buyers remain apprehensive on global economic uncertainties  Lack of affordable homes  skilled labor shortages  lower inventory and dearth of residential lots are also likely to act as headwinds  Increasing supply chain costs and escalating operating expenses are weighing on the companies  margins  despite higher product prices and solid cost control measures  Unfavorable product mix and adverse sales mix are putting further pressure on margins  We note that the housing and real estate markets are not immune to the tariff related woes  In fact  leading retailer of hard surface flooring and related accessories  Lumber Liquidators Holdings  Inc   LL  anticipates a tepid performance due to tariff related headwinds  Further  rise in commodity or raw material costs and transportation expenses and higher cost of investments toward technological advancements are likely to act as deterrents  Decline in lumber prices also remains a woe  The building products industry is focusing on digitalization  The industry participants are resorting to well planned strategies to connect offline and online channels including higher customer engagement and supply chain access to bolster growth  Digital savvy customers are increasingly resorting to online apps for home shopping  Further  retailers are embracing a completely integrated digital platform to cater to online purchases  We believe that the companies are well poised to gain from efforts to provide an interconnected shopping experience  with innovative products  Apart from digitalization  leading home improvement players  namely  The Home Depot  NYSE HD   Inc   HD  and Lowe s Companies  NYSE LOW   Inc   LOW  are benefiting from initiatives to boost Pro customer sales  The Pro segment is benefiting from efforts to enhance service capabilities like tool rental  delivery and the new B2B website Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Building Products   Retail industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  160  which places it at the bottom 37  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s  which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bleak near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  The industry s earnings estimate for the current year declined about 4 5  over the course of a year Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Outpaces in Terms of Shareholder ReturnsThe Zacks Building Products   Retail Industry has outperformed the broader Retail Wholesale Sector as well as the S P 500 index over the past year While the stocks in this industry have collectively

Price to Earnings Ratio  Past 5 Years Bottom LineImproving economic backdrop and higher home prices might drive sustainable growth for the Building Products   Retail industry  Additionally  continuous efforts toward digitization and product innovation are likely to benefit the players  However  a conservative consumer approach stemming from global uncertainties and an unimpressive Zacks Industry

Is falling confidence a threat to markets 
Last Week Recap
In  I asked whether it was time to worry about crowded trades  That was indeed the question on financial news to start the week    A massive market rotation called into question much of the  wisdom  of the last few months  Interest rates rose  the yield curve steepened  and value stocks rebounded versus momentum  Now  of course  the popular question is whether this  has legs  
The Story in One Chart




I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart  This week I am featuring the Investing com version  It is static in this report  but if you go to the site you can use a number of interactive features  For those who want to explore the effect of specific events  there are news callouts

The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
 high frequency indicators are an important part of our regular research  The results remain positive in all three of the time frames  with improving readings  NDD notes that the long leading indicators are still  very positive   His chief concern now is possible softness in Q3 earnings 
The Good
JOLTs showed continuing labor market strength  but the market is tightening  Some analysts look only at the total number of job openings  More important is the ratio of openings to job seekers and the quit rate  Both charts are from the excellent  










Mortgage applications were up 2 0  versus the prior week decline of 3 1 Initial jobless claims moved even lower  to 204K  This compares with the prior week s 219K and expectations of 218K 0

The Ugly
Refinery attacks  The drone strikes knocked out half of the Saudi oil capacity  about 5  of daily global consumption  This action reflects the continuing escalation of the regional conflict which threatens to expand as well  There is also a direct economic impact  although the refineries are expected to resume production  within days       
The Week Ahead

The Calendar
The calendar is bigger than usual  with an emphasis on housing data  Fans of the leading indicators will have that news on Friday  The highlight for everyone will be Wednesday s FOMC decision  




 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  Here are the main U S  releases 
Next Week s Theme
Traders currently believe that the Fed is supportive  but the question has become a broader one 
Is falling confidence now a threat to markets 
Background
On several occasions I have mentioned my concern about declining consumer and business confidence  When people are worried  it is easy to defer spending and investment   Let s delay the refrigerator replacement   Or  We ll have a better handle on future needs in a few months  We can hold off on starting the plant expansion until then   It is so natural  not a function of economic reality  but perceptions 
Once again  I will describe the evidence on this topic  taking up the key points which may help us reach a logical conclusion 
Uncertainty has Increased




Specifically  the rapidly shifting news on trade is weakening the economy because of uncertainty  This is in addition to the direct policy effects 
The uncertainty extends to all economic policy   not just trade 




Impact on Business
The effect is showing up in small business capital expenditures 




Effect on Individuals




56  of Americans rate the economy as  excellent or good   But 60  expect a recession in the next year    
Perceptions Can Spark a Recession
Robert Shiller draws upon past recessions to conclude that we should look to popular narratives about the economy in identifying the risk  
New crises that shake up the economy often surprise economists because no exogenous cause appears to be a sufficient explanation for a downturn  People begin to suddenly frame current events in the context of stories they had heard many times before 
This may seem puzzling until we realize that an old narrative has renewed itself in an epidemic  and people have begun to respond reflexively in their day to day decisions  If enough people begin to act fearfully  their anxiety can become self fulfilling  and a recession  sometimes a big one  may follow 
I ll have my own observations in today s Final Thought 
Quant Corner and Risk Analysis




I have a rule for my investment clients  Think first about your risk  Only then should you consider possible rewards  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update  featuring the Indicator Snapshot 
Short term technicals have improved to neutral  Long term technicals have also stabilized at neutral  Recession risk is still in the  watchful  area with the odds down a notch  We will probably see a higher C Score next week  reflecting a steepening yield curve  We are seeing little confirmation for the risk signals  which we have been monitoring since May 
Considering all factors  my overall outlook for investors remains bullish

Guest Sources
 provides a technical analysis  pointing out that the change in upside and downside volume from August to September 
August saw a number of days where 90  of the volume was on the downside  So close to all time highs  that s unusual behavior and signals very little patience among investors and the desire to sell first and ask questions later  In other words  it creates the negativity needed for a market low much sooner than later

David Templeton    studies two reports from this week NFIB and JOLTs   and observes that the recession talk is impacting expectations and sentiment  After a deeper look at the data  he concludes 
This data around the job market represents current activity and not expectations  Based on the JOLTS and the NFIB Survey  it seems the job market is certainly tight strong  It is difficult to image an economy tipping into a recession with this kind of survey data around the job market  I believe much of the angst for the U S  economy is being influenced by the commentary or headlines around a potential recession

Best of the Week
If I had to recommend a single  must read article for this week  it would be Safal Niveshak s   The article  drawing upon ideas from famous value practitioners  includes key arguments embracing this theme  The fact that the value approach doesn t work over periods of time is precisely the reason why it continues to work over the long term 




He then quotes Joel Greenblatt  via Jack Schwager  
It is very difficult to follow a value approach unless you have sufficient confidence in it  In my books and in my classes  I spend a lot of time trying to get people to understand that in aggregate we are buying above average companies at below average prices  If that approach makes sense to you  then you will have the confidence to stick with the strategy over the long term  even when it s not working  You will give it a chance to work  But the only way you will stick with something that is not working is by understanding what you are doing 
Few have the understanding required  This is not the approach taught in business schools  and it is not instinctive  As I wrote last week   Investors are an impatient lot  Even when they do not plan to sell assets in the near future  they want the comfort of Mr  Market s continuing endorsement of their current holdings  
See today s Final Thought for more about what to expect when the value approach kicks in

Final Thought
Faced with the typical long list of worries  we rely upon leadership to maintain public confidence 
Confidence is difficult to measure and nearly impossible to predict  Especially in the era of modern communications  news  real or not  can spread rapidly  Compelling narratives go viral  In statistical terms the confidence indicators are mostly coincident  At the moment I sense more of a leading quality in these measures  so I am watching them closely  When we consider the list of institutions we rely upon  the fragility is apparent  How many of these inspire confidence for you 
President TrumpCongressThe FedBusiness leadersBritish Parliament and PMEuropean Central BankersLeaders of  hot spot  countriesLeaders of countries with nuclear weaponsWhether or not you agree with their specific decisions  leaders need to command respect and support 
Leaders are important  but individuals also have self confidence  People often worry about major issues while still believing in their own business and prospects  That explains some of the divergences in confidence data

A key investment question  probably a theme coming to this space soon  is whether last week s rotation can be expected to continue  A few months ago I featured JP Morgan s ace quantitative strategist  Marko Kolanovic reports that the  flight from momentum is just starting     and   
Kolanovic sees this as the opportunity of the decade  concluding as follows 
 Yesterday s move was only started by discretionary  portfolio managers   and will continue with equity quants  that typically operate at lower frequency  e g  month end  and fundamental investors   he wrote   We believe that the value rotation can continue and the broad market could move higher going into October negotiations  and if real progress is made  continue into a more sustained rally  
Investment Implications
Investors wanting to profit from the great rotation can do so in simple ways by buying a value or small cap index  Those wanting to do even better should work harder to isolate the key stocks and sectors within these indexes  There are several pockets of opportunity which I am exploring 
Understanding the market helps in recognizing the future prospects  With comparative valuations so extreme  this  chance of the decade  will not disappear right away  It is not too late to act 
Confidence is the fuel for the economy

Lowe s analysts are estimating a  2 00 EPS on  20 98 billion in sales  which would represent 3 4  earnings decline and less than 1  revenue appreciation 
LOW has struggled to recover from its Q1 results  with share prices only 6 5  for the year  most of that gain being realized in todays trading   Look for margin expansion in Q2 guidance to be the key catalyst of a LOW rally  along with any upward revisions to guidance Lowe s Companies  NYSE LOW   Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   
Home Depot Results        
Home Depot beat EPS estimates but marginally missed on revenues in its July quarter earnings posted this morning  Management guided down full year sales as the company faces commodity deflation and tariff headwinds  Management estimated a 1 2  impact from the ensuing trade war  which could impact price points and hinder consumer spending if it endures  Timber deflation is also impacting Home Depot s topline 
Housing renovations are expected to slow as the overall housing market begins to cool down  This will have a negative impact on the firm s results 
The question that you are likely trying to answer is why HD is up on all the perceivably negative news  I believe that Home Depot s agile business techniques has allowed the company to weather the category s headwinds  Home Depot is working closely with suppliers to move production out of China and avoid as much of the tariff burden as possible 
Investors were conservative coming into this earnings report and believed that management would pull guidance down further from all the drawbacks I mentioned above  I believe this rally is merely a small release in investor concern 
Home Depot has been increasing its online presence with more than 9  of purchases done on their online platform  50  of online orders are picked up in store  saving customers the time it takes to navigate the massive store while being able to pick their home improvement needs up that day 
HD has performed admirably since the beginning of the year outpacing its biggest competitor  LOW  as well as the broader market  HD has rallied roughly 26  since the beginning of this year The Home Depot  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   
Take Away
Home Depot s ability to navigate the rocky economic waters thus far in 2019 is a positive sign for the home improvement retail sector  Investors are beginning to price in positive results for Lowe s imminent earnings tomorrow morning 
Look for Lowe s management to provide color on how they plan to manage the trade headwinds  anticipated slowing housing market  along with brick and mortar consumer spending declines  Margin expansions and upwardly revised management guidance could send LOW to new highs  Continued margin contraction might send LOW even lower

162359,383875,HD,Home Depot  HD  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Home Depot  NYSE HD  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 20  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This home improvement retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 09 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 3  
Revenues are expected to be  31 01 billion  up 1 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 01  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Home Depot 
For Home Depot  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 67  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Home Depot will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Home Depot would post earnings of  2 16 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 27  delivering a surprise of  5 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Home Depot doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/home-depot-hd-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200454659,200454659
162360,383876,HD,3 Dividend Stocks To Consider Amid Global Economic Uncertainties ,opinion,"After last week s trade banter between the U S  and China  investors flocked to commodities and government bonds as safe havens from economic uncertainties  This in turn sent bond yields plummeting to their lowest levels in years 
Many analysts believe that bond yields hitting these low levels  paired with monetary easing from central banks  should be enough to send stocks into another rally in the second half of 2019  Dividend stocks can provide the best of both worlds for investors looking for a more secure payout on their investments   of the stocks in the S P 500 offer a dividend yield of at least 1 7  
The allure of income yielding dividend stocks have the potential to bring investors back into the stock market  Trade tensions and fears of economic slowdown have hindered economic sentiment  but dividend stocks can offer worrisome investors refuge during rough economic climates 
However  investors should be wary of high dividend yield stocks as stocks with some of the highest yielding dividends can be indicative of poor returns  Dividends yields may be high because of recent hits to a stock s price  Instead  investors should look for dividend stocks with solid growth trajectories

162361,383877,HD,Why Home Depot  HD  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Home Depot  NYSE HD   which belongs to the Zacks Building Products   Retail industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this home improvement retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 4 63   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Home Depot was expected to post earnings of  2 16 per share  but it reported  2 27 per share instead  representing a surprise of 5 09   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 16 per share  while it actually produced  2 25 per share  a surprise of 4 17  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Home Depot  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Home Depot has an Earnings ESP of  0 71  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on August 20  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-08-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-home-depot-hd-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200456383,200456383

162387,383903,HD,Walmart  Home Depot adopt health insurer tactic in drug copay battle,news,"By Caroline Humer and Michael Erman NEW YORK  Reuters    Walmart  N WMT  and  Home Depot   N HD   two of the top 10 U S  employers  have embraced a health insurance strategy that punishes drugmakers for using discount cards to keep patients from switching or stopping their medications  Large U S  companies have started tightly managing how employees and their family members use these popular discount  or copay  cards for everything from multiple sclerosis treatments to widely used rheumatoid arthritis medications sold through a specialty pharmacy  The move reflects their frustration that the coupons  which lower patient out of pocket spending  can be a disincentive to seeking less expensive treatments and drive up health plan costs  For certain therapies  the insurance programs extract more money from the drugmaker or redirect the employee to a cheaper medicine  according to benefits experts  Home Depot s program  run by CVS Health  N CVS   has a particular focus on therapies for cystic fibrosis  hepatitis C  cancer  HIV  psoriasis  pulmonary arterial hypertension and hyperlipidemia  or extremely high cholesterol  according to health plan documents provided to Reuters  The company  which has 400 000 employees  said the program affects fewer than 1 percent of its plan members   Yet those participants can have an outsized impact on spending because of how costly it is to treat their conditions  Specialty drugs can account for more than half of a corporate health plan s spending on medicines  according to benefits consultant Mercer   Employers who use the most comprehensive program at CVS can save up to 7 percent on their total specialty medication costs  CVS told Reuters  Express Scripts Holding Co  O ESRX   the largest U S  manager of pharmacy benefits and the manager of Walmart s program  has a similar broad reaching program across specialty medications  But it also offers a more aggressive focus on hepatitis C  oral oncology drugs and hereditary angioedema treatments   CONCERNED DRUGMAKERS The programs  known as copay  accumulators  and copay  maximizers   are expected to expand in the next two years  from about 25 percent of U S  employers to as much as 50 percent  according to the National Business Group on Health  Drugmakers  are concerned about it because the bottom line is that it will cost them more money   said Brian Marcotte  the group s chief executive  Drugmakers are worried about the hit to profits if many more employers sign on  They are also concerned because they cannot easily track when the programs are being used   Eli Lilly   Co  N LLY  executives said last week that copay accumulator programs were having an impact on its Taltz psoriasis drug and Forteo for osteoporosis  but that it did not feel there was  significant exposure     Pfizer   N PFE  and AstraZeneca  L AZN  executives said in recent interviews with Reuters that they are monitoring the effect of these programs   The impact on our business is relatively limited  but it is a concern   said Ruud Dobber  who heads Britain based AstraZeneca s U S  commercial operations  AbbVie  N ABBV   maker of top selling arthritis treatment Humira  said in April it expects moderately higher spending on copay assistance this year  BYPASSING THE COPAY More than 170 million Americans have health coverage through their employers and pay some portion of their prescription drug costs  amounting to up to thousands of dollars a year in copayments  Employers say that keeps workers aware of the rising cost of medicines and more likely to accept cheaper alternatives  where possible   Drugmakers have tried to bypass that requirement to keep patients using their medicines  They offer discount cards that keep the patient s payment low  say at  25  when they fill a prescription  The drugmaker pays the remainder required by the health plan  thwarting employers  intentions   Pharmaceutical industry spending on copay cards has more than doubled to  7 billion over the past five years  mostly due to coupons offered on higher cost specialty drugs  according to consultancy ZS Associates  The programs at Express Scripts and CVS  which manage prescription drug benefits for employers  change how this works  A copay  accumulator  recognizes when an employee uses a drugmaker discount card and makes sure that money does not apply toward their annual out of pocket spending requirement   When the copay card runs out of money  a patient must either cover the full copay cost  get a new discount card  or stop filling the prescription  The program can apply to almost any drug coupon used at a pharmacy working with the pharmacy benefit manager  A copay  maximizer  is more limited in scope  but potentially as costly to the drugmaker  They apply only to a short list of drugs that employees purchase from specialty pharmacies run by Express Scripts and CVS   In maximizer programs some benefit managers  including Express Scripts  make sure patients sign up to receive copay cards from the manufacturers  They then raise the patient s required copayment to tap the discount cards for the maximum amount set by a drugmaker  which can be more than  10 000 annually for pricey drugs  
New Jersey based pharma and managed care consultancy Zitter Health Insights estimates that there are more than 41 million Americans in plans that use an accumulator and 9 million in plans with the maximizer approach  It is not clear how much overlap there is between the two as some employers use both ",2018-11-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/walmart-home-depot-adopt-health-insurer-tactic-in-drug-copay-battle-1685698,1685698

162412,383928,HD,Top 5 Things to Know in The Market on Monday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday  November 12 
1  Oil Prices Jump on Saudi Output Cut 
Oil prices were in focus after top exporter Saudi Arabia said it will slash its crude shipments next month in order to rebalance markets 
Following a weekend meeting of OPEC producers in Abu Dhabi  Saudi Arabia s energy minister Khalid al Falih said that Riyadh plans to reduce its oil supply to world markets by 500 000 barrels per day  bpd  in December 
An official from Kuwait  also an OPEC member  added that a broader output cut was debated  but a decision was postponed until the next full OPEC meeting  scheduled to take place in Vienna on December 6 
That helped lift oil prices off last week s multi month lows  with U S  crude gaining about 0 9  to  60 72 a barrel by 5 25AM ET  1025GMT  and Brent crude rising 1 5  to  71 24 per barrel 
The announcement comes as crude prices have fallen by around 20  since early October  buffeted by signs of growing output from key producers and indications that sanctions on Iran are unlikely to cut as much oil out of the market as initially expected 
2  U S  Futures Point to Mixed Open 
U S  stock futures pointed to a mixed start to the trading week 
During early morning U S  hours  the blue chip Dow futures were down 38 points  or about 0 15   the S P 500 futures dipped 2 points  or around 0 1   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 10 points  or roughly 0 15  
There are no notable earnings on Monday 
Big name retailers such as  Home Depot   NYSE HD   Macy s  NYSE M  and Walmart  NYSE WMT  will be among the major companies reporting results in the week ahead  as the third quarter earnings season begins to wind down 
Elsewhere  European stocks traded higher at the opening bell  but quickly slipped into negative territory as sentiment took a hit amid rising political risk in Italy and Britain 
Earlier  stocks in Asia were mixed  as investors remained wary over global growth prospects 
3  Fed Signals Boost Dollar to 17 Month High 
Away from equities  the dollar was higher across the board  amid expectations for the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates in December and beyond 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was up 0 6  to 97 30  having earlier touched its strongest level since June 2017 at 97 41 
Demand for the dollar was underpinned after the Fed indicated last week that rates are likely to rise in December and again in early 2019  with the U S  economy looking strong on almost every front 
Meantime  the U S  bond market will stay closed Monday because of the Veterans Day holiday 
No major economic reports are expected this morning  The highlight of this week s data releases will come Wednesday  when the U S  Commerce Department publishes October inflation figures 
4  Pound  Euro Sink Amid Brexit  Italy Woes 
Staying in the currency market  the British pound and the euro were notably weaker as investors watched developments surrounding Brexit talks and Italy s ongoing budget drama 
The pound fell about 1  to 1 2840  GBP USD   the lowest since November 1  following reports that British Prime Minister Theresa May had cancelled a cabinet meeting planned for later Monday to approve a Brexit deal amid a growing rebellion in her cabinet over her plans for exiting the European Union 
All eyes are now on a cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday 
Meanwhile  the euro dropped 0 7  to 1 1255  EUR USD   a level last touched in June 2017 
The single currency remained on the back foot amid an ongoing row between Brussels and Rome after the European Commission rejected Italy s 2019 budget last month  because it was in breach of European fiscal rules 
Italy s government has until Tuesday to submit a revised budget plan 
5   Alibaba  Sets Singles  Day Sales Record
Alibaba  NYSE BABA  smashed through last year s Singles Day sales record on Sunday  racking up more than  30 8 billion in the 24 hour shopping event  That topped the  25 3 billion record set in 2017 
In Chinese currency terms  sales totaled 213 5 billion yuan  easily beating last year s figure of 168 2 billion yuan and representing a nearly 27  year on year rise  That was  however  smaller than the 39  year on year growth recorded in 2017

162415,383931,HD,Lowe s  More Research Worthy Than Home Depot ,opinion,"Introduction
I am a firm believer and ardent supporter of conducting comprehensive research and due diligence on any company  stock  you might consider investing in  However  I have also experienced the reality that far too many investors make their decisions based on opinions  emotions or vague ideas about a company  instead of on comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the business they are considering  Consequently  far too many investors expose themselves to being prone to making significant investment mistakes because they simply do not have the knowledge to keep them from allowing their emotions to rule  In other words  volatile stock price movements can cause them to buy when they should sell   or sell when they should buy 
In contrast  those prudent investors that conduct the requisite research and due diligence are empowered to make rational and sound investing decisions  Furthermore  understanding the business behind the stock also empowers investors to make intelligent and reasoned forecasts of what the business can generate on their behalf in the future  Not the stock price  but the business  In simple terms  these more prudent investors know what their businesses are truly worth  Therefore  they are unlikely to sell when the market is pricing their business lower than it should be  and conversely  unlikely to buy when   and if   the market is pricing their desired company too richly 
Moreover  another issue that I have often come across is the idea that people really don t know how to comprehensively research a stock  Consequently  they often are deluded by simple statistical references such as P E ratios or dividend yields without a solid understanding of how those statistics apply to the actual company in question  It s important that investors recognize that valuation levels  i e  multiples of earnings  cash flows  etc  are relative  In other words  a company can be trading at  for example  a P E ratio of 20 and can mathematically be cheaper than a company trading at a P E ratio of 15  Ultimately  fair valuation is functionally related to the level of future cash flows  earnings  that each respective company can potentially generate  Earnings and or cash flow growth rates are the keys to understanding fair valuation levels 
Comprehensive Research and Due Diligence  Here s How to Do It
With all the above said  I was inspired to produce this article because of the excellent research produced by my friend Adam  at Dividend Sensei  on the big box home improvement chains Home Depot  NYSE HD  and Lowe s  NYSE LOW   People ask me all the time to explain what comprehensive research and due diligence is  The article found here recently published by Dividend Sensei is a classic example of how research and due diligence should be done  The article provides great insight into the underlying businesses  past  present and future of both Lowe s and Home Depot 
Therefore  I don t feel that I need to add any further insights into the businesses behind each of these two blue chip dividend growth stocks  However  I do feel that I can contribute an enhanced understanding of the dynamics that both these fast growing big box retailers provide  In other words  my contribution to Adam s excellent work is simply to analyze Lowe s by the numbers  To add further clarity  before I would go through the time and effort that Adam clearly engaged in  I would first run the numbers in order to determine if it justified the effort  Or as I like to say  is the company in question research worthy or not  To me personally  in the case of Lowe s  I think it is  However  Adam didn t convince me to go further with Home Depot  Although I like Home Depot the business very much  I would have to see it at a slightly better valuation before I would be interested in researching it further

Summary and Conclusions
From a valuation perspective  I consider Lowe s fully valued based on intrinsic value calculations and moderately undervalued based on historical normal valuation multiples  However  I would also add that you can pay more  a higher valuation  for a faster growing company than you can for a slower growing one  To put that into a clear perspective  there have been many times throughout Lowe s history that it traded at a significantly higher valuation than it does today  However  if you did not sell out your position  you would have still made a reasonable amount of money even if you bought it at its highest valuation 
A business capable of growing their earnings as fast as Lowe s has historically  and more importantly as fast as it is expected to continue growing  will cover up a lot of bad timing decisions  Stated differently  you almost can t pay too much for company if it grows fast enough  On the other hand  and I consider this critically important  you will make significantly more money and take on less risk if you are more prudent with valuation on the buy side  I believe the above video clearly demonstrates the veracity of those statements  Caveat emptor

162455,383971,HD,Florence to Batter U S  Data But Harm to Economy Likely Small,news," Bloomberg     The economic impact of Hurricane Florence is unlikely to be large but could muddle U S  data for months  judging from past experience 
Last year  Hurricanes Harvey and Irma constrained activity in the third quarter of 2017 and sparked rebuilding later in the year and well into 2018  making it hard to get an accurate and timely assessment of the impact on quarterly gross domestic product growth 
That will be a challenge again with Florence  forecast to be the worst storm to hit North Carolina in 64 years  and the storm season is far from over  Data on employment  consumer spending and manufacturing may also become trickier to analyze as economists gauge impacts of tax cuts and a trade war 
 The first place you ll likely see it is in initial jobless claims   Ryan Sweet  an economist at Moody s Analytics Inc  in West Chester  Pennsylvania  said in reference to Florence  At the same time  major storms  effects on the broader economy tend to be  pretty small  on aggregate  
When Harvey made landfall on Aug  25 along the Gulf Coast in Texas last year  initial filings for unemployment benefits surged in the week ended Sept  2 by the most since November 2012  Applications had similarly jumped following Superstorm Sandy s hit to the Northeast in 2012  Any spike this time would be temporary  and unlikely to cause concern  as jobless claims are at the lowest level since December 1969 
Here are some other economic indicators to watch 
Retail Sales  Consumer Spending
Based on consumer purchases that won t be made as a result of the storm    such as canceled events and missed dinners out    Florence may have a  700 million net negative impact on the U S  economy  not counting insurance losses  according to weather analytics company Planalytics  initial estimate 
 If you re a mom and pop and you happen to be in harm s way  this could be devastating   said Evan Gold  executive vice president at Planalytics  Florence is  going to be big  and it s going to be notable  but I m not sure it s going to be as big as others  such as Sandy 
Bloomberg Intelligence analysts reckon retailers  sales of food  water  home preparation items and cleanup supplies will rise both ahead of and immediately following the storm  but purchases of more discretionary items  including restaurant visits  apparel and home decor  are likely to diminish 
Automobile sales may be worth keeping an eye on  They took a hit in August 2017  then rebounded to a 12 year high in September as Americans replaced damaged vehicles 
This year  the hurricane s effects are already being felt in the stock market  with shares of home improvement retailers Lowe s Cos  and  Home Depot  Inc  NYSE HD   rising while insurance companies decline 
Jobs  Wages
Florence could affect millions of workers in the southeastern U S   with North Carolina  South Carolina and Virginia forecast to be hit the hardest  According to the Labor Department  flood zone counties in the states have more than 42 000 establishments employing 682 179 workers with a quarterly payroll of  7 4 billion 
After hurricanes Harvey and Irma last year  the initial reading on U S  payrolls showed a decline of 33 000 workers in September  the first pullback since 2010  The tally has since been revised to a gain of 14 000 jobs  and net hiring rebounded to 271 000 in October 2017 
About 1 5 million people were unable to work due to bad weather during September 2017  a 21 year high  and restaurants and bars  an industry where most workers only get paid if they show up to work  were particularly hit  Wages may show some impact too  Last year  the hurricanes boosted utility workers  overtime pay and kept people away from work in low wage industries such as leisure and hospitality 
Factories  Housing
Industrial production is another indicator to watch  It declined in September 2017 before surging in October as output at oil refineries and petrochemical plants returned to normal operations following Harvey related flooding in the Houston area 
New home construction also is sensitive to the weather  Residential starts were initially reported as a decline in September last year after Harvey and Irma ",2018-09-12,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/florence-to-batter-us-data-but-harm-to-economy-likely-small-1606833,1606833
162456,383972,HD,Might Be Time To Buy LOW,opinion,"Lowe s   NYSE LOW   fell over 11  following their Q1 earnings release this morning and continues to fall  LOW showed weaker than expected EPS results and management cut its full year earnings guidance by more than 8   The firm missed its EPS estimates by 8 3   with very little growth from the prior year  Revenues narrowly beat estimates and showed just over 2  growth from the same quarter last year 
Marvin Ellison took the helm as Lowe s president and CEO in July of last year and has committed to focus on consumer and retail fundamentals to drive growth  Ellison is concentrated on improving customer service  inventory control  and other efficiencies within the firm  The stock has been all over the place since the torch was passed last year  and with LOW s gap down this morning  the stock is performing below the S P 500 s 52 week performance  Lowe s went from being up almost 20  for the last 12 month yesterday to being up only 5 6  today 
Ellison s attempted improvements have taken a hit on Lowe s margins  Gross margins went from 33 11  for Q1 last year  down to 31 46  in this most recent quarter  This drop in gross margin is a concern for investors moving forward because it could be an indication of systemic issues with Ellison s new strategy 
I discussed how homebuilding   improvement retailers were correlated with the housing market in my article yesterday    I talked about some of the pressures that Home Depot   NYSE HD   and Lowes were facing for this past quarter and the rest of the year  Constraints include labor and land shortages for home builders as well as a wetter than expected spring  These caused an oversupply of lumber  meaning lower prices  and potentially lower demand for other construction products as well 
Take Away
Companies like Lowe s and Home Depot have betas above 1 because of their exposure to the volatile housing market  making them sensitive to economic pressures  If you are a contrarian investor and believe in both Ellison as a CEO and strong economic performance throughout the year  this may be a perfect time to buy LOW at a lower valuation  The market could be overselling LOW on this negative news

Here is a synopsis of all four stocks 
 
The Joint Corp has been posting some impressive topline growth and that has helped propel some recent earnings estimate revision to the upside   When estimates move higher so does the Zacks Rank and this stock has the highest Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and it is the Bull of the Day 
Description 
The Joint Corp  is a healthcare franchisor of chiropractic clinics  The Company s plans include  Single Visit  Premium Wellness Plan and Wellness Plan  It also provides a family wellness plan  The Company also provides removal of subluxations  It operates its clinics across  Albany  New York  Austin  Texas  Brentwood  California  Fort Mill  South Carolina  Lubbock  Texas  Lynnwood  Washington  Middletown  New Jersey  San Antonio  Texas  San Diego  California and Spartanburg  South Carolina  among others  The Joint Corp  is headquartered in Scottsdale  Arizona 
Earnings History
The earning history is pretty good for JYNT   Over the last four quarters I see two beats  one miss and one NA on the Zacks website   There was no estimate data for one quarter  but looking back at the price and consensus and EPS surprise chart    you can see of the last 6 quarters where Zacks had estimates  there were 5 beats and one miss 
Revenue growth like that is just what I love to see   Consistent revenue growth tends to help bring in new buyers to a stock 
Estimate Revisions
The Zacks Rank is an algorithm that is based on the movement of earnings estimates over the last 60 days   For JYNT  I see a positive one penny move for this quarter and nothing for next quarter 
The full year 2019 EPS consensus estimate has risen from  0 21 to  0 23   The 2020 EPS consensus estimate has moved from  0 52 to  0 54 
Those two cent moves don t seem like much but the implied growth rate is what is really attracting more and more investors to this story 
Valuation
JYNT has some lofty numbers in the valuation department   That style score grade of F is hard to swallow  as is a 124x trailing PE and 77x forward multiple   Given the franchise model  the book value is very low  so the 116x price to book multiple is going to keep that Zacks Value Style Score at an F for some time   That said  the 50  annual topline growth rate is going to draw a lot of attention  even with a 6 8x price to sales multiple 
 
Cabot Corporation is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and is the Bear of the Day today   Let s take a look at why this stock has the lowest of all Zacks Ranks 
Description
Cabot Corporation is a leading global specialty chemicals and performance materials company headquartered in Boston  Massachusetts  USA  Our businesses deliver a broad range of products and solutions to customers in every corner of the globe  serving key industries such as transportation  infrastructure  environment and consumer  Cabot Corporation provides performance solutions that solve customers  challenges today while preparing them to meet tomorrow s needs  Cabot is a leading provider of rubber and specialty carbon blacks  activated carbon  inkjet colorants  cesium formate drilling fluids  fumed silica  aerogel  and elastomer composites 
Earnings History
As I look at the detailed estimates page  I see an OK earnings history for CBT  The company has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 2 of the last four quarters and the other two quarters were misses 
The average surprise over the last four quarters is  1 92   so the beats were just a little smaller than the loss   We don t want to see that as investors 
Recent Earnings
I see the recent beat of a penny also came with guidance that was below consensus   The company now expects to see FY19 EPS of  4 05    4 30  and that is below the prior guide of  4 20    4 60   
Estimate Revisions
Following the beat and guide lower  estimates have dropped   This quarter the Zacks Consensus has dropped from  1 25 to  1 00   That is a big move lower   Next quarter has only seen a small move of 2 cents lower 
The full year estimate is at  4 13  but that is down from the  4 39 level it was at prior to earnings 
Next year has also taken a hit   The Zacks Consensus Estimate has slipped from  4 93 to  4 66 
Additional content 
Time to Buy LOW 
Lowe s fell over 11  following their Q1 earnings release this morning and continues to fall  LOW showed weaker than expected EPS results and management cut its full year earnings guidance by more than 8   The firm missed its EPS estimates by 8 3   with very little growth from the prior year  Revenues narrowly beat estimates and showed just over 2  growth from the same quarter last year 
Marvin Ellison took the helm as Lowe s president and CEO in July of last year and has committed to focus on consumer and retail fundamentals to drive growth  Ellison is concentrated on improving customer service  inventory control  and other efficiencies within the firm  The stock has been all over the place since the torch was passed last year  and with LOW s gap down this morning  the stock is performing below the S P 500 s 52 week performance  Lowe s went from being up almost 20  for the last 12 month yesterday to being up only 5 6  today 
Ellison s attempted improvements have taken a hit on Lowe s margins  Gross margins went from 33 11  for Q1 last year  down to 31 46  in this most recent quarter  This drop in gross margin is a concern for investors moving forward because it could be an indication of systemic issues with Ellison s new strategy 
I discussed how homebuilding   improvement retailers were correlated with the housing market in my article yesterday  Home Depot  Lowe s  and Housing Development  What to Expect  I talked about some of the pressures that Home Depot and Lowes were facing for this past quarter and the rest of the year  Constraints include labor and land shortages for home builders as well as a wetter than expected spring  These caused an oversupply of lumber  meaning lower prices  and potentially lower demand for other construction products as well 
Take Away
Companies like Lowe s and Home Depot have betas above 1 because of their exposure to the volatile housing market  making them sensitive to economic pressures  If you are a contrarian investor and believe in both Ellison as a CEO and strong economic performance throughout the year  this may be a perfect time to buy LOW at a lower valuation  The market could be overselling LOW on this negative news

162473,383989,HD,Home Depot Stock May Offer Entry Point If Wet Spring Hurts Q1 Earnings,opinion,"  Reports Q1 2019 results on Tuesday  May 21 before the market open  Revenue expectation   26 37 billion  EPS expectation   2 18
Home Depot  Inc   NYSE HD  isn t expected to report very promising first quarter results tomorrow  The largest U S  home improvement retailer is releasing earnings tomorrow amid signs of a housing slowdown and a spring season too wet for Americans to go out and buy their gardening supplies 
If these two factors hurt Home Depot s earnings  it will prolong the weakness that started in late 2018  The company reported comparable sales rose 3 2  in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in early February  well short of the 4 5  gain analysts had been expecting  That miss came after the company experienced one of the strongest expansions in its history  delivering year over year comparable sales growth for 30 straight quarters 
Along with a soft housing market  mother nature isn t helping Home Depot much  Across much of the Great Plains  Midwest and Northeast  the first green burst of spring was about a week to 10 days late  the USA National Phenology Network said on April 30  That means Home Depot sales related to the gardening season  its equivalent of Christmas  may not show much growth in the first quarter  Spring is the season when many shoppers buy gardening supplies and start home renovations  making it a key quarter for home improvement retailers  Home Depot s Q1 ends April 29 
Short Term Setbacks
But beyond these short term setbacks  there is little to suggest the boom period for the retailer is over  The latest developments on the economic front  particularly in the housing market  suggest that the housing weakness that started in September of last year isn t deepening 
U S  new home construction rose for a second month and topped estimates in April in a sign of positive momentum for the sector at the start of the second quarter  To counter a possible hit from the U S  China trade war  the Fed has moved to the sidelines  helping mortgage rates to stabilize 
Consumer spending  on the other hand  is still solid  as Walmart Inc   NYSE NYSE WMT  showed last week  The world s largest retailer reported its strongest Q1 comparable sales growth in nine years 
Helped by this economic strength  Home Depot stock has weathered the current market slump nicely  gaining more than 12  this year  to close Friday s session at  192 58  The other catalysts also boosting the company s upward trajectory are its attractive dividends and massive buyback plan aimed at supporting the stock if it becomes undervalued 

Bottom Line
An improving U S  housing market and strong consumer spending should continue to buoy Home Depot s share price this year  despite some setbacks early in the year  Any post earnings weakness should offer a good buying opportunity for investors who are looking for a smart entry point  The retailer is a good buy and hold candidate  even through the threat to the economy from the U S  China trade war escalation  Its quarterly dividend has expanded 500  over the past decade and  with a healthy payout ratio of 42   it has lots more room to grow ",2019-05-20,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/buy-home-depot-stock-if-wet-spring-hurts-its-q1-earnings-200422909,200422909
162474,383990,HD,Home Depot  HD  Tops Q1 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Home Depot  NYSE HD  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 27 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 16 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 08 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5 09   A quarter ago  it was expected that this home improvement retailer would post earnings of  2 16 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 25  delivering a surprise of 4 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Home Depot  which belongs to the Zacks Building Products   Retail industry  posted revenues of  26 38 billion for the quarter ended April 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 32   This compares to year ago revenues of  24 95 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Home Depot shares have added about 11 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 13 3  
What s Next for Home Depot 
While Home Depot has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Home Depot was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 13 on  31 07 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  10 08 on  111 27 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Building Products   Retail is currently in the top 40  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-05-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/home-depot-hd-tops-q1-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200423366,200423366

On Friday  Turkey remained in the spotlight as U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin s announced that the U S  is prepared to slap Turkey with more sanctions if its President Recep Tayyip Erdogan refuses the quick release of Brunson

For the last reported quarter  Home Depot came out with earnings of  2 25 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 16 per share  representing a surprise of 4 17   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 27 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 51 per share  delivering a surprise of 10 57  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Home Depot  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Home Depot currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 22   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on May 21  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-home-depot-hd-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200415944,200415944

162552,384068,HD,Dollar Weakens Following Powell Testimony,opinion,"Crude prices traded slightly higher following yesterday s slide as OPEC hinted that production cuts will go as planned  shrugging off President Trump s request for OPEC to ease efforts  U S  stocks were slightly lower  while the dollar declined after Fed Chair Powell s testimony solidified the Fed s dovish stance while providing not much new information regarding what the next policy move might be and an update on when they will stop the balance sheet unwind  Economic data from the U S  also painted a picture that consumer confidence is improving while housing continues to be soft  Momentum for the Asian trading session is likely to be limited  but the narrative of supportive central banks appears to be firmly in place 
Powell
Fed Chair Powell s first day of testimony went as planned  with financial markets learning nothing new  Powell confirmed patient  which means we will likely need to get through the first quarter of economic data before assessments of the economy will not be heavily influenced by the government shutdown and trade war concerns 
Slow inflation and lingering global growth concerns will likely outweigh the strength in the labor market  thus keeping the Fed cautious for the first half of the year  Market participants will clearly focus on the conclusion of the March 20 21st Fed meeting that will come with updated projections  The Fed will need to show their hand and either downgrade their projections for future rate hikes from 2 to either one or nil  The Fed fund futures market currently has no hikes priced in for 2019  but we should not necessarily expect the Fed follow  as we are starting to see some Fed members like Lorretta Mester display support of restarting rate hikes if the economy strengthens 
Stocks
As peak earning season winds down  headlines become sparse and the overall view of the economy is unlikely to be swayed  Both Home Depot and Macy s delivered disappointing guidance for 2019  highlighting a disappointing slowdown that likely will see first quarter remain soft and hopes for a pickup in the second half  Shares of Macy s were higher on the news of a restructuring plan  while Home Depot traded lower as their results were dampened by poor weather 

Oil
West Texas Intermediate crude finished the day higher but appears to remain vulnerable as the effects of the OPEC and friend s production cuts could be overdone  Russia appears to be falling short of holding up their end of the production cuts and if that is confirmed oil prices could continue a corrective move lower  Russian Energy Minister Novak refuted earlier reports that Russia only cut production by 114 000 barrels from December  much lower than the 150 000 promised in the OPEC and partners agreement  If compliance of the cuts are compromised and the U S  delivers more builds with their weekly crude oil inventories  oil may see the bearish correction accelerate 

Cohen Mueller Kim
The soap opera that is U S  politics will have a cluster of headlines that will likely dominate the papers but is not expected to deliver any major surprises  Michael Cohen is expected to deliver documents that he believes will implicate the President in criminal conduct and financial improprieties  Cohen has pled guilty to nine felonies including lying to Congress  While the accusations are serious  the markets will most likely pay greater focus to the Mueller report which could come out after the President returns from his trip to Vietnam 
The Mueller report will become a key story for financial markets but the base case remains that the President will not be impeached  Even if the House votes against the President  the Senate would still need to decide whether to convict President Trump 
Regarding the Trump Kim summit  the bar is very low for the second meeting  Both sides will try to agree upon what are denuclearization terms and North Korea will want to know what easing of sanctions they could expect if they complied  Talks have been deadlocked and there is probably less than a 10  we see anything constructive come out of these meetings  With satellite imagery suggesting North Korea has continued building warheads following the first summit  it will be difficult for the U S  believe in any promises from North Korea 
Gold
Gold was unable to muster up a significant rally despite a clear confirmation that the Fed will maintain their dovish pivot that was delivered in January  Lackluster moves were the theme of the day and the precious metal may need to see global growth concerns return in order for the bullish trend continue

162553,384069,HD,5 Dividend Stocks That Haven t Yet Rallied   But Will,opinion,"We contrarians stayed calm through the market s fourth quarter hissy fit  We not only held onto our shares through November and December but we also added dividend payers opportunistically to our portfolios 
Now  it s time for us to be a bit more conservative  Most US stocks have rallied so much that they are now  overbought   This means they ve gone up pretty far pretty fast and are due for a breather  or  perhaps  another correction  
Of course certain elite dividend growers are still good long term buys at current prices  aren t they always   And a select five pack of these picks also represents solid short term purchases as well 
Why should you care about the short run  Well  maybe you shouldn t  Getting the near term right isn t a requirement for a successful retirement  after all 
However  if you are speculating on short term moves   such as selling put options  or writing covered calls  or simply trading in days  weeks and months   then you should pay attention to timing 
Pick out dividend growers that fulfill the following criteria 
We have identified a  dividend magnet  ready to pull the current share price higher 
We d like to own the stock at a discount to its current price 
And my research and indicators favor these stocks in particular in the weeks and months ahead 
Let s start with the first concept because it s the most important  Dividends are magnets that pull their share prices along with them  If you re looking for the stock market s tail that wags the dog  pay attention to the payouts attached to a given share price 
Regardless of what the stock market does during any given trading session  or month  or whatever   we can stack the income odds in our favor by only selling puts on dividend growers we d be thrilled to buy at a discount anyway  For example  let s consider Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN   which has increased its payout  orange line below  by an amazing 600  over the last decade  Its stock price  blue line  was pulled higher by its payout 
TXN s Dividend Magnet
The best time to buy a stock like TXN is nearly anytime  But we can  cherry pick  our entries  and put option sales  by focusing on times when TXN s yield is higher than usual  These spikes in yield tend to be temporary and they often point out good dips to buy 
Buy the Dip  or High Relative Yield 
Thanks to the firm s recent 24  dividend hike  the stock will pay 2 9  over the next 12 months  more than its 2 6  trailing yield  
Moving on  in an overbought environment like this one  it helps to look for the laggards  Let s consider regional monopoly Exelon  NYSE EXC   which took a beating eleven years ago when natural gas prices collapsed 
Since then this rare  growth utility  has steadily gotten things together under CEO Chris Crane s leadership   And a competent manager is often all you need when you have a regional monopoly  Crane is excellent   After years of paying a steady but static dividend  EXC recently raised its payout for the fourth year in a row  Wall Street is beginning to appreciate this unfolding  dividend growth  story 
EXC s Dividend Growth Drives Share Price Growth
Shares pay 3  today  and investors will likely settle for less  meaning they ll pay a higher price  as EXC establishes itself as a growth utility 
Next  let s order up a quick growing fast food company that its parent probably wished it still owned  Twenty one years ago  PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  spun off its restaurant business into a separate company  A  10 000 investment in Yum Brands  YUM  at that time would be worth more than  230 000 today 
Yum has run circles around its old parent and  gold arches  industry standard McDonald s  NYSE MCD  too 
Mouth Watering Returns for Yum
Yum s secret  It s bet heavily on international growth and expansion for the past two decades  Its KFC brand was the first Western fast food company to open a restaurant in China  Today  Yum s overseas KFCs  Taco Bells  Pizza Huts and WingStreets account for about half of the firm s total profits 
The firm has hiked its dividend payout by 40  over the past two years  As long as it keeps deploying Colonel Sanders internationally  shareholders should continue to enjoy higher dividends and higher share prices 
Next up we have a company growing its free cash flow  FCF  by 117  over five years and its dividend by 167   Wouldn t that thrill any investor  Not so for hedge fund mega shareholder D E  Shaw   Co   which believed that Lowe s  NYSE LOW  could do better 
Two years ago  the firm posted cameras in Lowe s parking lots  compared them with images from top rival Home Depot  NYSE HD  and took Lowe s management team to task for underperforming the competition 
Not Busy Enough
Then CEO Robert Niblock made the self preserving comment that he valued the  constructive discussions   As you d expect  these productive talks eventually ended with Robert looking for a new employer 
Last July the new look board of directors installed Marvin Ellison  a respected Home Depot veteran  as the new boss  And Ellison was  well  less than impressed with what he saw  He popped by a store and asked a group of associates how they d manage a particular kitchen project for their customer 
They took him to the back of the store to show him their project management system   a dry erase board 
 Well  the customer doesn t have a dry erase board   replied Marvin   So how do they keep track of the project  
They replied   Well  Marvin  we give them a binder   How very last century 
Marvin Was Not Impressed by This Technology
Turnaround investing opportunities can be quite lucrative  When a stock s news improves from  bad  to merely  mediocre   by moving from  say  dry erase boards to computers   share prices often skyrocket    First level  investors don t realize that stocks trade off of current perceptions and hopes about the company  When these change   for better or for worse   the share price often moves in the same direction  
Let s close with a quiz of your magnet knowledge  By now you know that dividend hikes are the driving force behind higher stock prices  They are also quite predictable  So  why not  front run  the good news and buy shares ahead of a hike 
For example  Dollar General  NYSE DG  is due for a dividend raise early this spring  Since the discount retailer began paying a dividend in 2015  it s hiked its payout this time of year like clockwork 
Spring Has Sprung When Dollar General Hikes
Dollar General qualifies as  Amazon proof  thanks to its low price tag items  which don t make sense to ship   Thanks to its unique market positioning  the stock quickly shook off the stock market s  December disaster  and is again approaching all time highs 
The only problem with buying these stocks on your own  These yields 

At 2 1  this five pack will only get you  21 000 in annual income on a  1 million portfolio  If you re simply buying and hoping  you re sure banking on a big spring of price appreciation 
Fortunately  we can take chance out of the equation by using one of my favorite income strategies  Let me explain 
Just Released  How to  Force  a 7 5  Dividend From TXN  EXC   More
I ve found 4 mysterious  Dividend Conversion Machines  that let you rewind the clock  buy stocks like TXN  EXC and more  but instead of grabbing today s 4 4  dividend  you ll get the same incredible 7 5  CASH payout folks who bought in 2009 bagged instead 
But there s a vital difference  you won t have to take a stomach churning plunge to get it  like you would have back then 
Sure  handy slogans like  Buy when there s blood in the streets  are easy to say  But actually overcoming fear and hitting the buy button at a time like that is almost impossible for most people 
But with these 4 amazing  Dividend Conversion Machines   you ll grab the same massive dividend yields  7 5  to 8  or more  that the best blue chips never quite pay right now TODAY 
And these life changing payouts are safe  backed by these very same household name stocks 
Massive Upside and 7 5  to 8   Dividends in 1 Buy
What s more  you can grab these lofty payouts whenever you re ready  all at once  on an automatic yearly or monthly schedule   or simply whenever you have new money to invest 
It s all up to you 
Best of all  each of these 4 incredible investments that are about to explode and give us a massive price upside  too 
How massive 
I m talking 20   yearly price gains  on top of dividends of 8   10  and up

162566,384082,HD,As Trump talks of trade losses  China is a win for U S  East Coast ports,news,"By Howard Schneider CHARLESTON  S C   Reuters    For America s fastest growing East Coast ports  trade with China equals billions of dollars of investment and thousands of well paid jobs in the heart of Trump country and not  as the president portrays it  the death knell for America s middle class  At Atlantic ports in the southern United States  harbor channels are being deepened to handle bigger ships moving through a widened Panama Canal  cranes are being heightened to unpack the larger stacks of containers  new ship berths and expanded rail hubs are opening the door wider for the imported goods demanded by American consumers and businesses  Exports are on the rise too  and could be boosted if President Donald Trump strikes deals to export tens of billions of dollars in commodities and energy to China in an effort to cut America s  375 billion trade deficit with the world s second largest economy   China is where the growth is   said South Carolina Ports Authority chief executive Jim Newsome   I don t think the world can function without free trade     The global supply chain is based on trade and I don t think you can walk that back   Interviews with officials at key southeastern ports as well as federal employment data illustrate a piece of the U S  trade puzzle often lost in the back and forth among national policymakers amid talk of tariffs and import restrictions  Concern over a trade war flared anew this week as Washington said it still held the threat of imposing tariffs on  50 billion of imports from China unless Beijing addressed theft of American intellectual property  and China responded that it was ready to fight back  One reason for China s success in winning market share in the United States has been investment by American port operators to ensure that goods get to U S  stores with relative speed and without losing their cost advantage  Charleston  for example  touts a 29 day window for getting goods from Shanghai to Atlanta  Research published last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found that for many goods the journey from China to the United States adds as little as 3 percent to the wholesale cost  Along with other south Atlantic ports like Savannah  Georgia  and Jacksonville  Florida  officials in Charleston spent years planning for that future and along the way created thousands of the sort of blue collar middle wage jobs that Trump s election campaign pledged to expand    It is an issue that has been glossed over   the importance of these hubs   Absolutely the investments have been critical to the trade with China   said Michigan State University economist Oren Ziv  who is in the initial stages of research on how port investments affect local economies   A SURGE OF NEW JOBS China s rise as a global manufacturing center  as Trump often notes  displaced many manufacturing jobs in the United States  particularly producing lower value goods like furniture  One influential and widely cited study by economists David Autor  David Dorn and Gordon Hanson estimated that the  China shock  caused the loss of 2 4 million manufacturing jobs in the United States between 1999 and 2011  Other studies have disputed this  saying the numbers were much lower  and that trends like automation by successful manufacturers played an outsized role  But whatever the impact  the flood of imports has required more labor to move those goods around the country  Nationally  jobs in transportation and  material moving  increased by 1 2 million between 2012 and 2017  according to federal data  That included more than 190 000 additional truck drivers with a median wage of  20 an hour  roughly 13 percent above the national median  That set of occupations accounted for about 10 percent of the country s overall increase in jobs during the period  behind only generally lower paying positions in food service and personal care  The port in Savannah  the country s fourth busiest container dock  now pushes 11 000 container loads of goods a day through its gates   7 million microwave ovens worth of cargo space  about triple what was handled as of 2003  The groundwork was laid when officials offered incentives for companies like  Home Depot   N HD  and others to build distribution centers on land owned by the port authority  That has now burgeoned into 56 million square feet  5 2 million square meters  of warehouse space around the port  filled as fast as it can be built   The vacancy rate in early 2018 was 0 52 percent according to Colliers International data supplied by Savannah Port officials  A new rail hub designed to accommodate longer trains  along with  2 billion in dredging and other investments planned for the next decade will allow the port to compete for shipments of goods intended for destinations as far away as Chicago  said Georgia Ports Authority chief operating officer Ed McCarthy   FROM PUERTO RICO TO CHINA FOCUS Jacksonville is also deepening its channel  having in recent years switched its business model from north south trade with Puerto Rico as the anchor destination  to a focus on China  In Charleston  container traffic has been growing on average 8 percent a year since the end of the 2007 2009 recession as trade flows reoriented from Europe to Asia   A  560 million dredging project  split between the state and federal governments  will deepen the harbor from 45 to 52 feet  13 7 to 15 8 meters  and allow ships carrying up to 18 000 20 foot  6 meter  containers to unload  the current largest is 14 000 containers   A new  1 5 billion terminal currently under construction will add the ability to handle an additional 700 000 containers a year when it opens in 2021  with further expansion planned   To be sure  the benefits move in both directions   Charleston  for example  ships about  2 billion worth of vehicles a year to China  aiding the rise of BMW s  DE BMWG  plant in Spartanburg  South Carolina  as a source of high end vehicles for the Chinese market  The Spartanburg plant is the single largest exporter of vehicles in the United States  Likewise  if the Trump administration does manage to boost exports to China of agricultural goods and natural gas  the bigger ships and bigger harbors will have more outbound cargo   The three ports are not major grain shippers like New Orleans or the Pacific Northwest  but exports of oil seeds  meat and wood pulp have been growing  They now account for about a quarter of U S  wood pulp exports to China  and Charleston s exports of meat grew tenfold to  107 million from 2003 to 2017   But even if the boost in exports to China never happens  the dredging and expansion will continue  despite the trade debate raging in Washington   Why don t we think this is an issue  We continue to grow   said McCarthy of the Georgia Ports Authority   We have a terminal  Savannah  that can handle 5 5 million  containers   The design over the next 10 years is to handle 8 million and we are going to stay true to that

What are the bond markets trying to tell us 
Most likely the U S  bonds are still very attractive compared to global rates and the spreads for U S bonds got too wide and are now reverting to the mean 
Lower rates are good for PE multiple expansion 
S P 500  SPY 
The S P 500 is pointing to a slightly lower opening today certainly nothing horrible  There is a mild level of support around the 2 785 region  At this point  there is nothing to show a down day is the start of anything more severe  I don t expect today s sell off to last  I would not be surprised to see the markets higher by days end 

Caterpillar  CAT 
Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT  was downgraded to a Sell with a  125 price target at UBS today  The stock is trading lower this morning as a result  The downside in the stock now looks relatively limited  with a support level of around  132 

Home Depot  HD 
Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD  is trading slightly lower after it reported weaker than expected fourth quarter results  Support for the stock is now around  182  and a drop below that level opens the door to a steeper decline  Overall the trends in the stock seem healthy  and the outlook Home Depot gave for 2019 sounds strong  I d be surprised if the stock breaks support 

Exact Sciences  EXAS 
EXACT Sciences Corporation  NASDAQ EXAS  is trading higher after Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and placed a  120 price target on it 

Sage Therapeutics  SAGE 
Sage Therapeutic  NASDAQ SAGE  priced 3 3 million shares last night at  150  Resistance on the stock is around  165 

Goldman Sachs  GS 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc  NYSE GS  has struggled at the  200 level on many occasions and may be signaling a reversal on is on the way  and return to  183 

Facebook  FB 
Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB  is now facing resistance at  166  and I continue to believe this one eventually fills the gap

162595,384111,HD,Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,news,"Investing com   Top 5 things that rocked U S  markets this week
1  Rising Bond Yields Make Bold Return 
Rising U S  bond yields were the main driver of market direction on Friday as the 10 year treasury yield and 2 year treasury yield rallied sharply  prompting wild swings lower in U S  stock markets 
The 10 year treasury yield rose to a high of 3 128  as mostly positive data this week including two regional manufacturing surveys pointing to signs of inflation  reassuring investors the U S  economy remains on solid footing 
 Our forecast for the end of the year for the 10 year is 3 20   which means this week s trading action moved us roughly half the distance to our year end target   Wells Fargo said 
Mixed earnings from a slew of retailers including Walmart Inc  NYSE WMT   Macy s Inc  NYSE M  and  Home Depot  Inc  NYSE HD  did little to avert a weekly loss in US stock markets 
Macy s was the pick of the bunch after reporting earnings that topped consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines  while same store sales grew for the second straight quarter 
Escalating U S  China tensions also weighed on sentiment as President Trump said he doubted whether the second round of trade talks   which got underway on Thursday   would be successful 
The Dow Jones posted a weekly loss 
2  Crude Oil Prices Notch Third Weekly Win
Crude oil prices notched their third week of gains in row as the prospect of a shortage in global oil supplies continued to underpin demand  prompting traders to add to their bullish bets 
Investor expectations for a global oil supply shortage comes amid a U S  announcement this month that it would renew sanctions on Iran   expected in two waves   on Aug 6  And Nov  5  crippling the Islamic Republic s energy exports 
Data from the Energy Information Administration showing U S  oil stockpiles fell for the second straight week also supported sentiment on oil prices 
Crude futures settled 21 cents lower on Friday  as data showed U S  oil rigs remained at three year highs 
3  Dollar Hits 5 Month High 
The dollar bounced back strongly from a weekly loss supported by a rally in U S  bond yields and a slump in the euro 
Mostly bullish U S  economic data  sent bond yields soaring  renewing expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes  helping the greenback to a five month high against its rivals 
EUR USD posted a sharp weekly drop as Italy s 10 year bond yield sank amid concerns about proposals laid out by a future Italian coalition government 
The Five Star Movement and League reached a coalition agreement to govern Italy on Friday  but outlined proposals that may hurt public finances  raising investor concerns 
Falling European bond yields and rising U S  yields was cited by some analysts as the main driver of euro weakness  prompting traders to pile into the greenback 
 The fundamental driver of a rising US yield advantage relative to Bunds  coupled with concerns about government policy in Italy  look likely to remain in play   Action Economics said 
The dollar remained close to a five month high against a basket of major currencies on Friday 
4  Heavy Selling Pressure Hits Gold 
Gold prices ended the week  nursing one of their biggest weekly losses for the year  as they struggled to claw back some of the losses sustained earlier in the week  when the 10 year treasury yield cracked above 3  
The rise in geopolitical pressures  meanwhile    as U S  China talks on trade appeared to sour and Kim Jong Un got cold feet about a meeting with the President Trump next month   failed to support safe haven gold 
5  Bitcoin   Consensus Pump  Fails to Show
A fresh wave of selling hit bitcoin this week as traders expressed disappointment at the popular crypto s failure to stage a rally following the annual Blockchain conference  consensus  which got underway earlier this week 
Bold claims by analysts in the run to the conference had spark hopes bitcoin would be able to stage a rally  bouncing back from a slump last week following renewed regulatory concerns 
 Bottom line  We expect bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus   Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors said in the run up to the conference 
New insights into the current crypto environment from market participants attending the conference were few and far between  providing little reason for investors to pile into bitcoin 
The turn in sentiment on cryptos this week compared to recent weeks  was characterised by a sharp retreat in the total cryptocurrency market cap  suggested that traders remained wary of backing cryptocurrencies 
The total market cap of cryptocurrencies fell to about  376 billion  at the time of writing  from about  400 billion last week 
Over the past seven days  Bitcoin fell 3 30  on the Bitfinex exchange  Ethereum was flat  while Ripple XRP fell 2 02  on the Poloniex exchange ",2018-05-18,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/top-5-things-that-moved-markets-this-past-week-1454249,1454249

162621,384137,HD,Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Monday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday  May 14 
1  U S  China Trade Back In The Spotlight
Trade was back into focus after U S  President Donald Trump said in a Sunday tweet that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to give struggling Chinese telecom giant ZTE  HK 0763   a way to get back into business  fast  



The U S  government had imposed a ban on U S  companies from supplying ZTE with technology after the Chinese firm was found to have illegally shipped equipment to Iran 
With the second round of U S  China trade negotiations expected to kick off this week  the move by Trump was seen by some analysts as a concession from the U S  side 
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He  Jingping s top economic adviser  will attend the talks in Washington  which begin on Tuesday 
High level discussions in Beijing earlier this month appeared to make little progress but there have been signs recently of some easing in tensions 
Trump struck an optimistic tone ahead of the meeting  saying that  it will all work out  



2  Oil Prices Back Off Recent Highs
Oil prices edged lower  moving away from more than three year highs touched recently  as a rise in U S  drilling for new production dampened sentiment 
New York traded WTI crude futures dipped 20 cents to  70 52 a barrel  while Brent crude futures  the benchmark for oil prices outside the U S   declined 22 cents to  76 90 a barrel 
U S  drillers added 10 oil rigs last week  bringing the total count to 844  the highest number since March 2015  That was the sixth consecutive weekly increase in the rig count  underscoring worries about rising U S  output 
Losses were held in check as investors continued to assess the implications of President Donald Trump walking away from the Iran nuclear deal last week 
3  Dow Futures Up Nearly 100 Points
Dow futures rose  indicating stocks may be ready to pick up where they left off last week  as hopes of a thaw in U S  China trade tensions boosted sentiment 
The blue chip Dow futures rose 92 points  or about 0 4   the S P 500 futures tacked on 6 points  or nearly 0 2   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 21 points  or roughly 0 3  
Another win for the Dow Jones Industrial Average would mark its eighth straight advance  the longest positive streak since one that ended Sept  20  2017 
While just 10 S P 500 companies are due to report financial results this week  retailers are just getting started in what will be the last big wave of the first quarter earnings season 
 Home Depot   NYSE HD  unofficially kicks things off when it reports on Tuesday  results from Macy s  NYSE M  are on the agenda for Wednesday  while Walmart  NYSE WMT   the world s largest retailer  is due to report results on Thursday 
Elsewhere  in Europe  the continent s major bourses were slightly lower  as investors focused on Italian politics  trade relations between the U S  and China  and a dip in oil prices 
Earlier  in Asia  most markets in the region closed higher  with Malaysian stocks recovering after dropping at the open as markets reopened following an election 
4  Dollar Falls For 4th Session In A Row 
The dollar edged lower against a basket of the other major currencies  putting it on track for its fourth down session in a row 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was down around 0 2  at 92 21 
The index hit four and a half month highs of 93 26 last Wednesday before retreating to end the week almost unchanged  as tame U S  inflation data tempered expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve 
No top tier U S  economic data is on the calendar for Monday  but the rest of the week will be busy enough  with retail sales due Tuesday 
Elsewhere  the euro pushed higher even as two Italian political parties reached a deal that puts the country on course to be led by an antiestablishment and euroskeptic governing coalition 
The single currency changed hands at 1 1985  EUR USD   having recovered from last week s lows of 1 1821  a level not seen since late December 
5  Fed Speakers Eyed For Rate Hikes Hints
A busy week for Federal Reserve speakers kicked off with Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester  who has a vote on monetary policy this year  saying the central bank may need to raise interest rates above 3  if the U S  economy grew faster than expected 
She made the comments at the Global Interdependence Center s central banking series in Paris  France earlier on Monday 
Next up  St  Louis Fed President James Bullard is slated to speak about cryptocurrencies at the CoinDesk Consensus 2018 conference in New York at 9 40AMET  1340GMT  
Bullard on Friday spelled out the case against any further interest rate increases  saying rates may already have reached a  neutral  level that is no longer stimulating the economy 
Investors have fully priced in a rate rise at the Fed s next policy meeting on June 12 13  However  Wall Street is divided over how many more time the central bank will raise interest rates after that ",2018-05-14,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-monday-1445133,1445133

Coming off the strong rally of more than 2  last week when stocks saw their best weekly gain since March  investors looked set to continue the bullish momentum on Monday 
The fact that U S  President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that he planned to help Chinese telecom ZTE  HK 0763   get back to business  eased tensions ahead of a second round of trade talks that begin on Tuesday  even though Beijing has indicated that it does not plan to change its current stance in the trade dispute 
With no major economic reports scheduled for release on Monday  investors will watch for clues from Federal Reserve policy makers on the pace of future rate hikes this year 
Speaking earlier on Monday  Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester reiterated her support for  the continued gradual removal of policy accommodation  
While Mester said that she does not expect inflation to pick up sharply  she warned that the Fed may need to raise interest rates above 3  if the U S  economy grew faster than expected 
Markets have fully priced in a rate hike at the Fed s next two day meeting ending on June 13  with another increase to come at the September policy decision  However  market participants remain on the fence over whether an additional rate hike will arrive in December

162625,384141,HD,Home Depot s Sales Miss Suggests Cooling U S  Housing Market,news," Bloomberg      Home Depot  Inc  NYSE HD   s lackluster results last quarter are adding to concerns the U S  housing market is cooling off 
Revenue and comparable store sales at the world s largest home improvement retailer missed analysts  estimates  although profit beat expectations for the 16th straight quarter 
Home Depot s fortunes are so tightly intertwined with the housing market that they are often viewed as a proxy for the sector  The rationale is simple  If Americans feel like their properties are rising in value  they ll spend more fixing them up 
But prices have been sagging in some parts of the U S  and mortgage rates have risen  Labor shortages have also slowed the building of new homes  While that can maintain demand for existing ones  it often limits the number of first time homebuyers 
Home Depot shares fell as much as 2 4 percent to  186 51 in premarket trading  They had climbed 22 percent in the past year through Monday s close 
Revenue rose to  24 9 billion in the period that ended April 29  missing the average projection of  25 2 billion 
The company reiterated its annual forecast for revenue of about  107 5 billion and profit of  9 31 a share  confirming a February projection 
Earnings in the first quarter amounted to  2 08 a share  Atlanta based Home Depot said  Analysts projected  2 05 
Sales at stores open for more than a year    a key benchmark for investors    rose 4 2 percent  That missed analysts  prediction for growth of 5 6 percent  according to Consensus Metrix 
In December  Home Depot laid out long term goals of boosting annual sales to as much as  120 billion by 2020  from  100 9 billion last year  That would equate to revenue growth of 6 percent a year  It also plans to boost capital expenditures to bolster its supply chain  cut checkout times and train employees

The median sales price rose 2 9  on an annual basis to  253 600  This was the lowest increase since February 2012  Slowdown in home price growth is an indication that owners who are struggling to sell their homes are now trimming down prices  Meanwhile  the drop in price increase might infuse some momentum in the market for potential buyers who have been away from the sector owing to escalated prices and fears of a housing price bubble 
From the perspective of inventory  it would take around 3 7 months to sell all homes in the market  down from the 3 9 months last November  Realtors see less than five months of supply as an indication of a tight housing market

This home improvement retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8 98  
For the last reported quarter  Home Depot came out with earnings of  2 51 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 27 per share  representing a surprise of 10 57   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 84 per share and it actually produced earnings of  3 05 per share  delivering a surprise of 7 39  
Price and EPS Surprise

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Home Depot has an Earnings ESP of  0 36  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 19  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-home-depot-hd-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200380675,200380675

162652,384168,HD,Optimism With An Asterisk  China Talks Spur Market Hope,opinion," Tuesday Market Open  Renewed hopes for progress in trade talks with China helped set a positive tone early Tuesday after Monday s move higher  However  investors will have to wait to see if anything concrete lies behind this confidence 
Overseas markets appeared to share some of the optimism  as European and most Asian stocks marched upward overnight  In addition  crude oil is staging a rally  and would be up for seventh straight day if it can remain higher throughout the session  Crude is often seen as a canary in the coal mine for the world economy  and its 30  descent last fall contributed to concern about global growth 
The government shutdown and trade talks with China look like they could continue to be the big fundamental features  at least until earnings season begins in earnest next week  Until then  geopolitics might be in the driver s seat for a while  President Trump is scheduled to make a speech tonight about the shutdown 
Despite tension around China and Washington  markets do seem to be in a better place than they were back around the holiday  The S P 500  SPX  is now up about 200 points from where it was at the conclusion of trade on Dec  24  a day some analysts now call the  Christmas Eve Massacre   However  the SPX is still down 7  from its 200 day moving average of 2 741  and down 13  from its all time high close posted just a few months ago  So things might feel a bit better now than they did right before Christmas  but we re likely far from out of the woods 
Optimist Club
For those seeking positives  a couple of developments Monday conceivably could point to a more sunny time as the days grow longer  First  the small cap Russell 2000 Index  RUT  led the other major indices  see chart below   The RUT fell more sharply than the SPX over the last several months  sinking into bear market territory  However  some analysts see the RUT as a leading indicator of market strength  so consider keeping an eye on that index to see if it continues to be a leader on the way higher  It s already up 4 2  in just a few trading days so far this year 
On Monday  some of the top performing sectors included ones that bulls typically like to see taking leadership  including consumer discretionary and energy  Visa  NYSE V   Nike  NYSE NKE  and Home Depot  NYSE HD  all seemed to find some buying interest  while so called  defensive  sectors like utilities and consumer staples lagged  In addition  the Nasdaq  COMP  outpaced the SPX  a possible sign of investors perhaps being more willing to embrace tech and biotech stocks that tend to perform better in strong economic times 
While we re talking optimism  Tuesday s NFIB Small Business Optimism report for December looked virtually unchanged from November  down just a smidgen 
Bears Still Appear to Outnumber Bulls
Another positive  besides the RUT and consumer discretionary out performance  is that bearish expectations remain elevated  At this point  the ratio of bears to bulls is much higher than normal  according to market research firms  and historically that s sometimes preceded better times for stocks  However  history isn t necessarily guaranteed to repeat 
Meanwhile  the yield on the benchmark 10 year Treasury note continue to gain ground  climbing two points to 2 68  on Monday after falling well under 2 6  last week  With the underlying Treasury prices under pressure  it could potentially hint that some investors might be exiting more conservative Treasury positions to get back into stocks  but whether that s a trend remains to be determined 
While there could arguably be some reasons to feel optimistic  the slowdown in economic data both in the U S  and abroad continued Monday with the ISM Non Manufacturing Index falling to 57 6  in December  While a reading above 50  is still a sign of expansion  the figure was down from 60 7  in November and failed to meet the average analyst estimate  according to Briefing com  The report followed a downward reading in the ISM Manufacturing Index for December  and falling numbers in these reports could hint at a possible slow down in earnings growth 
One interesting note Monday was that despite the rally  the VIX  the market s most closely watched  fear indicator   stayed pretty elevated  That might be an indication of trader nerves about tariffs and the Fed minutes due tomorrow 
More Data Ahead  Along With Fed Minutes
Fed minutes might be the key report to watch this week  These are from the December meeting  when the Fed raised rates despite a growing chorus of voices suggesting the Fed might want to stand back  The minutes could conceivably shed light on how the Fed reached its decision  which was unanimous  and what sort of factors the Fed saw that it felt justified the hike  The other thing to potentially look for is what participants might have said about the need   if any   that they might have seen for future hikes and what factors might cause them to raise rates again 
Later this week comes monthly consumer price index  CPI  data  along with earnings from Delta  NYSE DAL   However  the bulk of earnings season doesn t really get started until the big banks announce their Q4 results late next week 

Figure 1  More Aggressive Stance  It s still really early  but this five day chart shows that so far in the new year  some investors appear to be taking a more aggressive type of trade that embraces small caps in the Russell 2000  candlestick  and biotech and tech stocks in the Nasdaq  purple line   Both of these indices are doing better over this snapshot in time than the broader S P 500 Index  blue line   Data Source  S P Dow Jones Indices  FTSE Russell  Nasdaq  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Volatility Rings in New Year  If there s been one constant over the last three months of wild market action  it s arguably elevated volatility  The VIX started shooting up back in October and hasn t made any signs of coming back toward 2018 lows since  It s still above 20 despite a pullback so far in 2019  With China trade talks this week  followed by Fed minutes due tomorrow and then a speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell  it s not as if the market won t lack potential news events that could bash the market around one way or the other  Of those three  the China talks might have the biggest impact on continued volatility  in part because the market tends to dislike uncertainty and no one is really sure what the rules are going to be on trade 
The last few weeks have seen severe ups and downs in the market  with two gains of 3  or more in the last seven sessions for the S P 500  SPX  heading into Monday  The indices plunge one day on fear  and then swing back the opposite way a day later on talk that maybe the selling was overdone  It wouldn t be surprising to see this trend continue  despite a bit of a muted session on Monday  simply because so much is up in the air on the trade situation  A lot could rest on what level the tariffs ultimately reach  The higher they end up  the potentially worse impact on the market 
Shy and Retiring Fed  After several years of steady Fed rate hikes  the futures market makes 2019 look like the start of a new trend  Rather than predicting Fed action  the market now predicts Fed policy makers to stay on the sidelines  There s almost no chance of a Fed hike in the first half  according to CME futures prices  and chances of even one hike before the end of the year currently stand at around 12   down from approximately 50  just a month ago  In fact  there s a much larger chance  the futures market indicates  of the Fed lowering rates by 25 basis points before year end  with odds for a 25 basis point drop in rates by December now seen at 15   Just for historic perspective  the Fed hasn t lowered rates since the 2008 09 recession 
Now this could certainly change depending on economic data  and it s never easy to predict rate moves that are still months away  One question that lingers is whether the current Fed funds rate of between 2 25  and 2 5  is now the  new neutral  rate for the economy  meaning it neither stimulates nor hinders consumer and business economic activity  In the past  neutral was often seen as being higher than this  above 3   However  with economies in China  Europe and Japan all struggling  the Fed might not want to push rates much higher and risk making U S  products more expensive to consumers overseas already dealing with a relatively robust dollar  Higher rates can often contribute to dollar strength 
Counting Your Cows  Though the government remains partially shut down  that shouldn t affect Friday s release of consumer price data  We ll preview expectations for that tomorrow  However  the shutdown is affecting release of agricultural data  which could have potential implications for some of the major firms in that arena like Archer Daniels Midland  NYSE ADM  and Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   If agricultural economists can t get data on things like how many acres of soybeans and corn farmers might plant and the size of the country s livestock herds  it could potentially complicate decision making for some of the firms that buy commodities to process into food  Assuming the shutdown continues  it might be interesting to listen to some of the earnings conference calls from these firms to get a sense of how the lack of data might affect them

162669,384185,HD,The Market Loved Powell s Speech ,opinion,"Without a doubt  Jerome Powell is the most popular guy on Wall Street today  The Fed Chair s speech this afternoon in New York was just what the market needed  as his dovish tone led to one of the best rallies we ve seen all year 
	The NASDAQ surged just under 3   or about 208 points  to 7291 59  while the Dow jumped 2 5   or around 617 points  to 25 366 43  The S P rose 2 3  to 2743 79 
	The major indices have now finished in the green each day so far this week  The Dow has surged over 1000 points in these past three sessions  More importantly  several of the editors believe that Powell s comments and the subsequent rally raise the odds that we have put in the lows for the year  excluding any negative surprises  
	The Chairman said that interest rates are  just below  neutral  which means that they are neither speeding up nor slowing down the economy s growth  That s quite the change from his previous statement that rates were a  long way to neutral   A December rate hike remains nearly certain  but such comments have opened the possibility that the Fed may cancel further rate hikes in 2019 if that s what the data suggests 
	And just like that  investors are feeling a whole lot better about one of the two big issues that this consequential week brings  The market wanted to hear that the Fed wasn t hellbent on at least three more hikes in 2019  Check  Now all eyes move to Argentina where President Trump and China s President Xi will be meeting at the G 20 to discuss the trade issues between the world s two largest economies 
	If the market gets its way again  the two leaders will have a fantastic meeting that culminates in a big hug and the end to all these trade conflicts  But that s not likely to happen  The market certainly isn t expecting it  However  even if there aren t any breakthroughs  it could still be a positive meeting that helps stocks begin the final month of the year on a high note  After all the tough times in this correction  we re due for a few positive surprises   Today s Portfolio Highlights Home Run Investor  The market is looking better after Powell s speech and the consumer is still strong  Brian Bolan felt that this was a good backdrop to add Logitech  LOGI  on Wednesday  as computer gear will undoubtedly be under plenty of Christmas Trees again this year   This stock was around  50 before the correction  but then slumped to a 52 week low at about  32  Today  it is bouncing off that level  The editor thinks it can continue rising as we move closer to the holidays  LOGI also has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past four quarters with an average beat of nearly 18   Read the full write up for more on this new addition Momentum Trader  Shares of US Cellular  USM  have broken out to new 52 week highs since its quarterly report  which included a positive surprise of more than 70   While its always great to see such momentum  it s all the more impressive that it has taken off  like a rocket ship  during a weak market that s in a correction  Earnings estimates for the current quarter and the current year have been on the rise recently  Dave likes the momentum he s seeing in the face of market adversity  so he added USM on Wednesday with a 12 5  allocation  Read the full write up for more Insider Trader  The portfolio is pretty close to full after Tracey bought three names on Wednesday  The new buys and their insider activity include

Staying in the U S   a report on existing home sales will be the highlight of the holiday shortened week  Markets stateside will remain closed on Monday for the President s Day holiday 
In the UK  investors will be looking ahead to a second reading on British growth data for further hints on the health of the economy and the likelihood of the Bank of England raising interest rates this year 
Meanwhile  market players will eye flash survey data on euro zone business activity to assess how fast the European Central Bank will start unwinding its asset purchase program 
Elsewhere  Japan is to publish closely watched inflation data as investors look for signs on the strength of the economy and hints on when the Bank of Japan will start withdrawing stimulus 
Recent chatter that the world s leading central banks will step back from easy policies and raise rates at a faster pace than is currently priced into the market due to a pickup in inflation has sparked a global bond market selloff this year  with yields in the U S   Europe and Asia all spiking higher 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  Fed FOMC Meeting Minutes
The Federal Reserve will release minutes of its most recent policy meeting on Wednesday at 2 00PM ET  1900GMT  
The U S  central bank left interest rates unchanged following its meeting on Jan  31  the last under the leadership of Janet Yellen  and said inflation was likely to rise this year  Those comments signaled that borrowing costs will continue to climb under new central bank chief Jerome Powell 
Besides the FOMC minutes  markets will also be paying close attention to comments from around a dozen Fed speakers this week for their views on the recent uptick in inflation and how that can affect monetary policy 
Topping the agenda will be remarks from influential New York Fed boss William Dudley as well as Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester  a known hawk  Both are scheduled to participate in panel discussions at the United States Monetary Policy Forum  taking place in New York on Friday 
The Fed is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting on March  20 21  with interest rate futures pricing in an 82  chance of a rate hike at that meeting  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
A recent batch of stronger than expected U S  inflation data has bolstered bets that the Fed could increase interest rates as many as four times this year  more than the three it currently forecasts 
2  U S  Existing Home Sales
The National Association of Realtors will publish data on January existing home sales at 10 00AM ET  15 00GMT  Wednesday 
The consensus forecast is that the report will show that transactions of second hand homes rose 0 9  to 5 62M from 5 57M in December 
Besides the housing report  this week s holiday shortened calendar also features U S  data on manufacturing and service sector activity  as well as jobless claims figures 
Meanwhile  on Wall Street  markets will remain closed Monday for President s Day  Earnings in the week ahead include results from retail heavyweights Walmart  NYSE WMT  and  Home Depot   NYSE HD   both due ahead of Tuesday s opening bell 
The Dow and S P 500 rose 4 3  each last week  posting their best weekly performances since 2016 and 2013  respectively  The Nasdaq jumped 5 3   meanwhile  notching its biggest one week gain since 2011 
Elsewhere  news out of Washington D C  is expected to keep investors on their toes  as the investigation into President Donald Trump campaign s ties to Russia continues to rumble on 
3  U K  Fourth Quarter GDP   Second Estimate
The Office for National Statistics is to produce a second estimate on U K  fourth quarter economic growth at 09 30GMT  4 30AM ET  on Thursday 
The report is forecast to confirm the economy grew 0 5  in the final three months of last year  underlining the view that the British economy remains on a solid footing  On a year over year basis  the economy is forecast to grow by 1 5   also unchanged from an initial estimate 
The second reading will include a breakdown of business investment growth 
Ahead of the GDP report  monthly unemployment data will be eyed on Wednesday for further indications on the continued effect that the Brexit decision is having on the economy 
While Britain s economy is lagging behind the global recovery  it has held up better than the gloomy forecasts made at the time of the 2016 vote to leave the European Union 
The Bank of England kept interest rates steady earlier this month  but signaled it was likely to raise rates sooner and by more than it thought a few months ago as it seeks to keep a grip on inflation 
The BoE will hold its Inflation Hearings on Wednesday  where Governor Mark Carney and his colleagues will discuss recent inflation developments before the Treasury Select Committee 
4  Flash Euro Zone PMIs
The euro zone is to publish preliminary data on manufacturing and service sector activity for February at 0900GMT  4 00AM ET  on Wednesday  amid expectations for a modest decline 
Ahead of the euro zone PMI s  France and Germany will release their own PMI reports at 0800GMT and 0830GMT respectively 
In addition to the PMI data  there are also a pair of surveys on German business sentiment from both the IFO and ZEW institutes  which if they remain strong could push the European Central Bank another step closer to ending its mass stimulus program 
Minutes from the ECB s January policy meeting will be published on Thursday  The ECB said it will keep its  2 5 trillion stimulus program in place for as long as needed at that meeting  and stated that there are  very few chances  that it will change interest rates this year 
Despite those remarks  market players remain convinced that easy monetary policy in the region is coming to an end sooner rather than later 
The central bank cut its monthly bond purchases from  60 billion to  30 billion back in October  but extended the program until the end of September 2018  citing muted price pressures 
5  Japan Inflation Data
Japan s Statistics Bureau will publish January inflation figures at 8 50AM Tokyo time on Friday  2350GMT Thursday  
Market analysts expect the headline figure to remain positive  rising 1 3  year on year  which would be the 13th straight month of annual increases 
But the modest year on year increase will be well off the Bank of Japan s 2  target and keep the central bank under pressure to maintain its massive monetary stimulus 
There have been some indications recently that the BoJ is setting the ground to begin discussions on winding back its quantitative easing program  triggering speculation it will follow the Fed and ECB and start normalizing policy sooner than expected

162721,384237,HD,Trump tax cuts trickle across America  bringing glee and skepticism,news," Reuters    President Donald Trump s  1 5 trillion tax overhaul  touted as major tax relief for individuals and corporations  is showing up in bigger paychecks and bonuses awarded to workers by companies whose tax bills are being slashed 
More than 200 companies  including  Home Depot  Inc  N HD    American Airlines Group  Inc  O AAL  and AT T Inc  N T   are giving bonuses to at least 3 million U S  workers  according to the conservative Americans for Tax Reform group 
Reuters has interviewed people around the country on the benefits they have received so far  While they welcome the additional income  the cuts have largely not changed individuals  longstanding views on Trump or the two major political parties 
Here are their views 
  TIM SMITH  Fort Lauderdale  Florida
Working two jobs to make ends meet  61 year old Tim Smith was happy to get a  400 bonus as a part time worker at Home Depot thanks to the U S  tax overhaul  but his dislike for Trump and his policies remains 
 What can I do with that  Not a lot  Buy some groceries  maybe pay a bill or two  That s it   said Smith  as he deposited materials for recycling at the Home Depot where he works  He figured that after taxes  the bonus netted him  280 
Home Depot last month announced it would give its hourly workers a bonus of up to  1 000 as a result of Trump s tax plan 
 I did benefit  yes  but  I believe  in seven years  anything we get is going to disappear   said Smith  adding he believed the tax plan was a  rip off  that would help the wealthy and add  1 trillion to the national debt 
Smith  who sports a long pony tail  lives with his wife in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Oakland Park  where he owns a home  Their two children are off to college 
He says the middle class will eventually pay for the tax breaks  in cuts to programs such as Medicaid  Medicare and Social Security 
 That money s got to come from somewhere  and it s going to wind up coming from the middle class   said Smith  who made about  55 000 in 2017 from the two jobs he works 
A graduate of the University of Rhode Island with a degree in history and political science  Smith said he moved to Florida in 1991 and took any job he could 
He has worked part time for Home Depot for 10 years  on top of working full time at an aluminum processing company  which did not pay a tax related bonus  Smith said he will probably work until he is 70 
Asked how he felt about Trump  Smith said   To be honest  I can t stand the man  
  WILL ORTEGA  San Antonio  Texas
Trump supporter Will Ortega  32  was happy to see trickle down economics in action when he got a bigger paycheck due to the tax cuts 
A supervisor at an infrastructure safety company  which controls traffic during highway renovation projects in San Antonio  Ortega s take home bimonthly paycheck went up by  50  and he knew exactly what to do with it 
 Lunch money   he said  sitting at his desk wearing his neon yellow work clothes   I was real careful with how I spent my money on food  Now it s like if I want to go out to eat an extra day or not wake up early to make lunch  I don t have to worry about it  
Ortega  who lives with his girlfriend and their 1 year old daughter  makes about  50 000 a year 
 I m a firm believer in the trickle down economics of it  he said   I m real happy that my boss got a tax break  given he s not a Fortune 500 CEO  
Ortega said his boss was investing back into the company  which benefited all the workers 
 He s making more money  and in turn  we just picked up two brand new trucks  so it s a lot more comfortable for the guys to work in  We re also able to hire more guys and take some of the workload off us   he said 
When it comes to Trump  Ortega said he would vote for him again  despite his dislike of Trump s social media presence 
 As a celebrity on social media  I think he s worthless and I can t stand him  As for the policies he s put into effect and the progress he s making  I couldn t be happier   he said 
  LIZ HAMMOND  Somerville  Massachusetts
An administrative assistant at a university outside Boston  Liz Hammond  36  was skeptical the tax cuts passed by Congress in December would mean much for her financially  And then her paycheck rose by about  5 a week 
 I ve seen a change  It s tiny though   Hammond said 
Hammond  who lives in Somerville with her boyfriend and cat  said she fears that the tax package will lead to cuts down the road in social spending programs 
 I have friends who are on food stamps and disability and things like that  and we don t have a  federal  budget sorted out and I am terrified we ll lose these programs   Hammond said  adding that she would gladly have given up the tax cut if it protected those programs 
Hammond said she did not vote for Trump and was no likelier to vote for his re election  The new law cut the federal income tax rate on her roughly  45 000 salary to 22 percent from 25 percent  a cut that is set to expire in 10 years 
 When I ve finished paying off my student loans and start to accumulate money and maybe think about saving for a house  it s not going to be there   Hammond said   I don t know anyone who is benefiting from this  
  JEFF ANDERSON  Lincoln  Nebraska
Jeff Anderson  a 33 year old account manager for a software company in Lincoln  Nebraska  said he received a  1 000 bonus because of the tax cut  about  600 after taxes 
 I was able to purchase a few things I ve been putting off   Anderson said   My computer was failing so I built a new one  I bought a few books  The remainder is in savings  just in case  
A registered Democrat who said the bonus represents less than 1 percent of his annual salary  Anderson describes himself as  socially liberal  fiscally conservative  
Anderson lives with his wife in a modest brick home  where he spends his free time brewing craft beer  cooking  gardening and doing home improvement projects 
Although Anderson did not read the tax cut legislation  he feels the benefits depend on demographics 
 I have a feeling the effects will be as varied as the people who make up this country   he said 
Anderson said he did not vote for Trump  whom he feels has no respect for people from different backgrounds 
 To put it nicely  I think he s the embodiment of everything bad about this country   he said 
  MICHAEL JEFFERSON  Bloomington  Indiana
A graduate assistant making  1 000 a month at Indiana University in Bloomington  Michael Jefferson was disappointed to see a modest  15 22 increase in his paycheck this month as a result of the tax cut bill 
 So about  15 a month for me is maybe a third of a tank of gas or maybe two trips to Chick fil A   Jefferson said   Frankly  the largest tax cut in history was a big bust  
Jefferson  27  who is originally from Indianapolis  is studying for a dual masters degree in public affairs and environmental science  He has voted Republican in the past but did not vote for Trump 
 This cut is evidence of the fact that he is more show than he is substance   Jefferson said 
When not working as a graduate assistant  Jefferson has three other jobs  substitute teacher  application reviewer for Teach for America and research assistant 
 As a graduate student who makes about  20 000 a year  I saw this as a massive giveaway for the rich   he said   This bill hasn t changed the fact that I still have to work several different jobs to make ends meet  
Although he is in the lowest tax bracket  Jefferson owns stock in DowDupont Inc  N DWDP  and said his investments did increase as a result of the bill s benefiting mostly big companies 
 People who get the largest benefit are not the people who need it   he said 
  BYRON JOHNSON  Chicago  Illinois
A Republican who is disillusioned by Trump  Byron Johnson  37  a personal banker in Chicago who grew up on the city s South Side  expects to benefit from tax breaks as a small time real estate investor 
But the self described Christian  who has a wife and four kids and lives in a four bedroom condo in Chicago s West Loop neighborhood  feels the tax policy will not help those less fortunate  like some of the struggling families he knew growing up 
 It s hard for a parent to say  Should I pay bills today or should I buy groceries   he said 
Johnson works at Fifth Third Bank in the city s Loop and also invests in real estate  buying apartment buildings and single family homes on Chicago s West and South sides  rehabilitating them and renting them out  Johnson said he made over  100 000 a year from his real estate business alone 
He expects to get an even bigger tax break under the new tax law for writing off clothes for meetings  gas  car and part of his home since it includes a small office 
Johnson said he plans to use the extra money for college tuition and weddings of his children  now ages 1 to 13  and to invest in more real estate 
Johnson had flown from London  where he lived previously  back to Chicago to vote for Trump because he felt successful corporate people paid too much in taxes  But he is disappointed by Trump because he feels Trump is prejudiced against some people 
Johnson said he would not vote for Trump again 
 Oh  heck no  This is just pure buffoonery   Johnson said 
  JULIE HERNANDEZ  San Antonio  Texas
Home Depot cashier Julie Hernandez  56  was shocked to get a  140 bonus check after working at the company for only nine months until a friend explained it was because of the tax bill 
 I don t understand it all  I didn t know it was from a tax break  We work hard and for them to be paying their employees more  that s awesome   she said as she crossed the street to go to a Dairy Queen in San Antonio after a four hour shift 
Hernandez has been working customer service jobs for the last 38 years  from fast food to retail  and earns about  10 000 a year 
Hernandez  who voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election  said she is grateful for the small financial gift but that does not erase Trump s other faults 
 He s a bully to foreigners   she said   I am grateful  don t get me wrong  but it doesn t change my opinion of him  
After purchasing dinner for herself and her elderly mother  Hernandez scrambled to the bus stop as the bus approached  She takes two buses to travel back and forth to work  a 10 15 minute ride if the drivers are on schedule  up to an hour if they are not 
Hernandez pays  38 a month for an unlimited bus pass so the bonus check will cover some of her travel expenses 
 I m going to try to stretch it out  I live on my checking account   she said 
  RACHEL KEANE  Douglas County  Colorado 
Rachel Keane  a 36 year old stay at home mother of three small children who voted for Trump  was happy to see her family s income boosted by the tax overhaul 
Her husband makes about  100 000 annually as a software engineer  and the new tax law has added  300 per month to his take home pay  she said 
 It may be crumbs to some people  but not to me   she said in a telephone interview  She said the family will use the money to pay for groceries and other household expenses 
 And my husband and I might even be able to go on a date night   she said 
Keane said she supports the reduction in the corporate tax rate and said it will benefit working Americans 
 I m very pleased with the president  he s showing real leadership   she said ",2018-02-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-tax-cuts-trickle-across-america-bringing-glee-and-skepticism-1215950,1215950

162730,384246,HD,Buy Home Depot  HD  Stock After Strong Q3 Earnings Results ,opinion,"Home Depot   NYSE HD   reported better than expected top and bottom line results Tuesday morning  Maybe more importantly  the home improvement power raised its full year earnings guidance once again  So  is now time to buy Home Depot with HD stock still down roughly 16  from its 52 week high 
Q3 Overview 
Home Depot helped kick off a busy week for traditional brick and mortar retailers with reports from Macy s   NYSE M    Walmart   NYSE WMT    and other giants due out later in the week  The firm posted adjusted quarterly earnings of  2 51 per share  This marked a 36 4  jump from the year ago period and easily topped our  2 27 Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Home Depot s Q3 revenues also beat our  26 235 billion estimate and climbed 5 1  to reach  26 302 billion  The company s operating income hit  3 87 billion  which marked a 5 2  jump from the year ago period  For the first nine months of 2018  revenues jumped 6 1  from  77 02 billion to  81 71 billion 
Comparable sales which are always a vital retail metric popped 4 8   Meanwhile  U S  comps jumped 5 4   We should note that overall comps jumped 4 8  in Q2 and 5 3  in the first quarter of 2018  The company also noted on its earnings call that big ticket sales  transactions over  1 000 that represent roughly 20  of U S  sales  surged 9 1    Once again  we saw strong performance in many Pro heavy categories as Pro sales grew faster than the company s average comp   Home Depot EVP of merchandising Ted Decker said on HD s Q3 conference call 
Full Year Outlook 
Looking ahead  Home Depot now expects its full year revenues to climb by approximately 7 2  in a 53 week year  The company had previously called for a 7  jump  but this falls in line with our current 7 25  growth estimate that would see HD post fiscal year revenues of  108 21 billion 
The retailer also called for fiscal 2018 comp sales to jump 5 5  above the comparable 52 week period  More impressively  Home Depot upped its adjusted full year earnings guidance from  9 42 per share to  9 75  This would mark a roughly 33 8  climb from fiscal 2017 
Investors should  however  note that Home Depot s updated earnings guidance includes the positive impact of roughly  8 billion in share buybacks  up from the previously guided  6 billion 
Stock Price Movement
Now that we have covered Home Depot s third quarter results  it s time to take a quick look at its recent stock performance to help us understand if HD might be worth buying right now 
Shares of HD are up roughly 7  over the past 12 months  but have slipped 5  since the start of 2018  More recently  Home Depot stock is down nearly 6  during the past month 
Home Depot stock rested at  180 30 per share through mid afternoon trading Tuesday following its quarterly earnings release  This marks a nearly 16  downturn from its 52 week and all time high of  215 43 per share  and sets up what could prove to be a solid buying opportunity for investors high on Home Depot right now 
We can also see that Home Depot stock has outpaced its industry over the last decade  which includes the likes of Lowe s   NYSE LOW    Fastenal   NASDAQ FAST    Lumber Liquidators   NYSE LL    and others  HD s climb also crushes the S P 500 s 215  expansion 
 
Valuation
Moving on  Home Depot is currently trading at 17 8X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which marks a discount compared to its industry s 24 3X average  HD is trading above the S P s 16 3X  but it has traded as high as 23 7X over the last year  with a one year median of 20X 
Home Depot is also trading not too far above its 52 week low of 17 1X  And we can see that Home Depot is trading near its five year median of 18 5X  Therefore  HD s valuation picture is hardly stretched at this time 
 
Bottom Line
Home Depot shares have performed very well over the last decade and its growth outlook appears strong after it posted solid top and bottom line Q3 beats  We also can t forget that Home Depot is a strong income stock  which helps it look more attractive amid our recent market pullback 
More specifically  Home Depot has lifted its quarterly dividend consistently over the last few years  HD has paid a quarterly cash dividend of  1 03 per share in 2018  which marked a nearly 50  jump from 2016 s  0 69 and a 16  climb from 2017 s  0 89

Home Depot shares have lost about 5 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2  
What s Next for Home Depot 
While Home Depot has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

162750,384266,HD,Body broker who sold diseased remains is convicted of fraud,news,"By John Shiffman WASHINGTON  Reuters    A Detroit businessman who sold and leased donated body parts for two decades was convicted Monday of defrauding medical customers by selling them diseased human remains  The case against Arthur Rathburn is part of a growing national investigation by federal authorities into the largely unregulated market for body parts in the United States  Federal agents found a grisly scene when they raided Rathburn s warehouse in 2013  including remains frozen together flesh on flesh  Current U S  laws only regulate body parts intended for transplant  such as hearts and livers  The buying and selling of body parts for research and education    Rathburn s line of business    is legal under U S  law  He was charged with defrauding clients by selling them body parts infected with HIV and hepatitis without their knowledge  Rathburn s ex wife and business partner  Elizabeth  testified that they bought body parts from companies that encourage people to donate their bodies to science  In an effort to boost profits  she testified  the Rathburns sometimes bought infected bodies and parts  which are sold at discount because few medical entities want them for training or education   Elizabeth Rathburn pleaded guilty to fraud  and she cooperated with the prosecution  During testimony before the federal jury in Detroit this month  she said that she expects her sentence will be between four and 10 months   Arthur Rathburn  who did not testify at trial  faces a maximum of 20 years in prison  although the U S  sentencing guidelines the judge must consider generally call for a shorter term  Both are expected to be sentenced in the spring  Rathburn was convicted on seven counts of fraud and acquitted of two counts of fraud  His lawyers had contended that the case focused on contract disputes with his customers over the quality of his products and ought to be brought in civil court  not criminal court   There are no industry regulations regarding the business Arthur Rathburn was engaged in   his defense lawyers argued in a court filing   Industry standards and what constitutes a  clean  environment are subjective matters  not a matter for criminal prosecution    Reuters reported last month that authorities found four fetuses  each in its second trimester  during the warehouse raid  It is illegal to sell fetuses  Rathburn was not charged with doing so  and it s unclear how the fetuses were acquired  Officials and defense lawyers have declined to comment on the matter  The discovery of the fetuses  however  may be raised during the sentencing phase   The government s failure to stop Rathburn sooner  despite a decade of warning signs  was one in a series of stories Reuters published last year about the industry   As part of the series  a reporter purchased two human heads and a spine from a broker in Tennessee  deals made with just a few emails at a cost of  900  plus shipping  The series also profiled two Phoenix brokers    one who earned at least  12 million from the sale or use of donated body parts and one who pleaded guilty to defrauding customers  The latter  Steve Gore  cooperated with the government and testified against Rathburn in the Detroit trial  He told the jury that he  made mistakes  while operating a business that harvested 5 000 bodies in a decade  but said that he had no state or federal regulations to guide him   A Reuters story in December described how Gore s technicians dismembered bodies with construction saws purchased from  Home Depot   NYSE HD   Under cross examination  Gore was asked if he used the construction saw instead of a proper medical instrument because it was cheaper

162755,384271,HD,Home Depot  HD  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Home Depot  NYSE HD  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 13  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This home improvement retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 27 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  23 4  
Revenues are expected to be  26 25 billion  up 4 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 16  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Home Depot 
For Home Depot  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 81  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Home Depot will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Home Depot would post earnings of  2 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 05  delivering a surprise of  7 39  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Home Depot doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/home-depot-hd-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200355511,200355511
162756,384272,HD,Should You Buy Home Depot  HD  Stock Before Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Home Depot   NYSE HD   helps kick off the retail heavy portion of Q3 earnings season next Tuesday  ahead of reports from Macy s   NYSE M    Walmart   NYSE WMT    and other giants later in the week 
The question is should investors consider buying Home Depot stock ahead of earnings  Let s see what to expect and look at some of its current fundamentals to find out 
Price Movement  
We can see in the chart below that Home Depot stock has crushed the S P 500 over the last five years  Home Depot stock has climbed over 50  in the last three years  with much of that expansion coming in the last 24 months  With that said  the last year has not been as kind to the home improvement retail powerhouse 
Shares of HD are up roughly 14  in the last 12 months  but have slipped around 1  since the start of 2018  Plus  Home Depot stock is down nearly 6  during the past three months  Home Depot stock closed at  187 23 per share on Wednesday  down 13  from its 52 week high of  215 43 per share  which sets up what could prove to be a solid buying opportunity 
 
 
Valuation
Moving on  HD is currently trading at 18 6X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which marks a significant discount compared to its industry s 25 7X  Home Depot is trading slightly above its rival Lowe s   NYSE LOW   at 17 3X and the S P 500 s 16 8X 
But HD has traded as high as 23 7X over the last year  with a one year median of 20X  The company is also trading not too far above its 52 week low of 17X  We can also see that Home Depot is trading below its five year median of 19 9X  Therefore  HD s valuation is picture hardly appears stretched at the moment 
 
Overview   Outlook
Now that we have covered Home Depot s current valuation picture and its stock price movement  it s time to take a quick look at its business and understand what we should expect from the company s third quarter financial results 
Home Depot is the world s largest home improvement retailer and boasts 2 286 locations  The firm did  100 9 billion in sales last year  up 6 7  from fiscal 2016 
Looking ahead  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Home Depot s third quarter revenues to jump by 4 9  to reach  26 25 billion  Meanwhile  HD s full year revenues are projected to surge 7 3  to touch  108 23 billion 
At the other end of the income statement  Home Depot s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop 23 4  to land at  2 27 per share  Better yet  the home improvement giant s fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to climb over 28  
It is also worth noting that Home Depot s comparable store sales are expected to climb 4 7  based on our current NFM estimates total comps jumped 5 3  last quarter  Furthermore  Home Depot s overall customer transactions are projected to climb by roughly 4   with its average ticket expected to pop from  62 84 to  64 74 
Bottom Line
Investors should note that Home Depot s earnings estimate revision activity has trended downward over the last 30 days to help HD earn a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Yet  HD sports an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system and its stock rests below where it has traded recently  Plus  Home Depot almost always tops our quarterly earnings estimates  with beats for over five straight years  
 
It is also worth remembering that Home Depot is a solid income stock  This helps it look more attractive  especially during market uncertainty  Better yet  Home Depot has significantly increased its quarterly dividend over the last few years  HD paid a cash dividend of  1 03 per share in the second quarter  which marked a nearly 50  jump from 2016 s  0 69 per share and a 16  climb from 2017 s  0 89 
Home Depot is scheduled to release its Q3 financial results before the opening bell on Tuesday  November 13  And it looks like Home Depot stock might be worth considering

162772,384288,HD,Special Report  A business where human bodies were butchered  packaged and sold,news,"By John Shiffman  Reade Levinson and Brian Grow PHOENIX  Reuters    Sam Kazemi stood over the old man s corpse  Nearby lay pliers  a scalpel and a motorized saw designed to cut drywall and pipe  On a busy day  Kazemi might harvest body parts from five or six people who had donated their bodies to science  On this day in November 2013  the corpse before Kazemi typified the donors who gave their remains to his employer  Biological Resource Center  The man was a retired factory worker with a ninth grade education  He had lived with his wife in a mobile home in Mohave Valley  Arizona  and had died six days earlier  aged 75  His name was Conrad Patrick   But after he died and his body was donated  Patrick became a commodity  known by the company s initials and a number  BRC13112103  Reuters reviewed thousands of internal BRC records and confidential law enforcement documents containing profiles of Patrick and 2 280 other donors  The documents include invoices and inventories for thousands of body parts harvested from those people  They show how their bodies were dissected  which body parts were sent where  and why buyers obtained them   Kazemi helped cut up and package Patrick into seven pieces  BRC shipped Patrick s left foot to a Chicago area orthopedic lab  His left shoulder was sent to a Las Vegas company that holds surgical seminars  His head and his spine went to a project run by the U S  Army  And Patrick s  external reproductive organs  were sent to a local university  His right foot and left knee were placed in the company s freezers  where they became part of BRC s million dollar inventory of flesh and bone  For more than a year  Reuters has examined America s body trade  a little known and virtually unregulated industry  These businesses  which call themselves non transplant tissue banks  are also known as body brokers   The operations can resemble meat packing plants  At BRC  body parts from heads to fingernails were harvested and sold  On Saturday mornings  Kazemi taught college students how to dismember cadavers in the company lab  He also starred in a grisly training video  demonstrating how to carve out a man s spine using a motorized saw  The documents obtained by Reuters   along with dozens of interviews with investigators  former BRC workers and families of donors   offer an unparalleled look at how one of America s major body brokers operated   The records  never before made public  also reveal how little the government or the donors themselves understood what was happening at the company  and show in graphic detail how a cadaver becomes a commodity   Sales invoices detail many of those transactions  For  607  BRC sold the liver of a public school janitor to a medical device company  The torso of a retired bank manager  bought by a Swiss research institute  fetched  3 191  A large Midwestern healthcare system paid  65 for two femoral arteries  one from a church minister  And the lower legs of a union activist were purchased by a Minnesota product development company for  350 each  For raw material  the industry relies in large part on people too poor to afford a funeral  offering to cremate a portion of each donated body for free   A Reuters analysis of BRC donor files from May 3  2011 through January 20  2014 confirmed how important the disadvantaged were to business  The vast majority of BRC donors came from neighborhoods where the median household income fell below the state average  Four out of five donors didn t graduate from college  about twice the ratio of the country as a whole  Before brokers accept a body  they typically present the donor or next of kin with a consent form  These agreements are often written in technical language that many donors and relatives say they find hard to understand  The documents give brokers the right to dismember the dead  then sell or rent body parts to medical researchers and educators  often for hundreds or thousands of dollars  At BRC  a whole body sold for  5 893  records show  Since 2004  when a federal health panel unsuccessfully called on the U S  government to regulate the industry  Reuters found that more than 2 357 body parts obtained by brokers from at least 1 638 people have ended up misused  abused or desecrated   Documents reviewed for this article indicate that those figures are vastly understated  The extent of BRC s operation surprised even investigators who raided the Phoenix based company in 2014  There  agents discovered 10 tons of frozen human remains   1 755 total body parts that included 281 heads  241 shoulders  337 legs and 97 spines   Applying a state forfeiture law  authorities hauled away the contents of BRC s freezers  filling 142 body bags  One bag held parts from at least 36 different people   The seizure was so large that officials struggled to properly handle the body parts  When plans to cremate the remains stalled  officials brought three walk in freezers to a military base and stacked the body bags inside  one atop another  Parts from 851 different people remained in those freezers for almost three years before they were cremated  The raid on BRC was part of a broader federal probe into the suspected practices of one of its clients  Arthur Rathburn  A Detroit body broker  Rathburn has pleaded not guilty to charges of defrauding customers  During a 2013 search of Rathburn s warehouse  federal agents found rotting body parts along with four preserved fetuses  confidential photographs reviewed by Reuters show  It is not clear how Rathburn acquired the fetuses or what he planned to do with them  He was indicted for allegedly selling diseased body parts without warning buyers  His trial is set for January  After the BRC raid  the company went out of business  Its founder and former owner  Stephen Gore  later pleaded guilty to fraud   not for selling body parts but for misleading customers by shipping them contaminated specimens  His punishment  probation  He is expected to testify at the Rathburn trial   Gore s attorney  Clark Derrick  said Gore always tried to act in the best interests of his donors   At some point the business grew exponentially  we became shorthanded  we cut some corners  and for that I apologize and make amends   Derrick said on Gore s behalf  PROFITING OFF THE POOR Gore housed his business in a 9 000 square foot building once occupied by an insurance agency   a one story facility near two interstate highways and the Phoenix airport  From 2005 until early 2014  court records show  BRC received about 5 000 human bodies and distributed more than 20 000 body parts  As Reuters reported last year  BRC also sold body parts to U S  Army contractors for military experiments  A Pentagon spokeswoman said BRC provided the body parts  under false pretenses   misleading the Army that consent had been secured for donors to be used in destructive tests  Among the parts BRC sold for the Army experiments were the heads and spines of Conrad Patrick and Leon Small  a 71 year old retiree who had once managed a furniture factory   On the consent forms Patrick and Small signed  each man checked a box stating that he did not wish to be used in military or destructive tests  records show   But just days after Patrick and Small died  a BRC employee called their widows and persuaded them to amend the forms so their husbands could be used by the military  according to recordings of the calls reviewed by Reuters  The widows said the calls came during a traumatic time    I didn t understand what they were talking about   Dona Patrick said   But I said  OK    Bodies or parts from at least 20 BRC donors were used without their consent in Army experiments  Reuters found  Parts from Small and Patrick  however  were not  The military halted testing when it learned of the raid at BRC   The shoulders of both men were sent to a for profit surgical training company in Nevada  The widows  Karen Small and Dona Patrick  are among two dozen next of kin who said they were surprised to learn that BRC profited from a relative s donated body    They prey on people that have no money  that are poor  that have no insurance   like us   Patrick said  Family members of some donors said BRC employees led them to believe body donation was regulated by federal and state authorities  and that selling body parts is illegal  Based on those pitches  the relatives said they believed the remains wouldn t be sold  In truth  there are virtually no regulations on the body trade   It s a horrible thing   Small said   Sick   In a statement to Reuters last year  Gore said his employees took  great care to ensure that donors and their families were well informed about the processes   Gore acknowledged at his sentencing that he relied on books and the Internet for instruction on how to handle the bodies he sold    HOMEMADE HORROR MOVIE  In 2012  BRC hired lab technician Kazemi  He earned  21 an hour  Before joining the company  his resume shows  he spent the previous decade working as a real estate agent  a waiter at a Morton s steakhouse and a manager for an Olive Garden restaurant   When he arrived at BRC  he was 35 and had just graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in kinesiology  the study of body movement  At ASU  he was a teaching assistant in an anatomy lab  In 2013  Kazemi starred in a BRC instructional video  It opens with a jarring title  punctuated for emphasis   Stripped Cervical Spine   The video begins with a close up of Kazemi wearing a mask  gloves  goggles and a surgical gown  Then it pulls back to reveal a body face down on a table  The man s shoulders and arms have already been sheared off  The head lolls from side to side until Kazemi holds it still   With a scalpel  he makes incisions along the neck and back  then peels away the man s skin and scalp  About seven minutes into the video  Kazemi picks up a construction saw   On this one   he says of the cadaver   we are using a sturdy  thicker 9 inch blade  You want to make sure that the blade is long enough to reach from ear to ear across the back   In his interview with Reuters  Kazemi described the video as clinical and  not disrespectful to donors  in any way  It was meant for internal use only  he said  Kazemi also said he did not know how BRC acquired donors or where body parts were shipped  In hindsight  Kazemi said using a motorized saw was wrong because it cannot be cleaned well enough to avoid spreading diseases   Would I do something like that now that I know better  No   Kazemi said   But at the time  that s what was provided to me   Two retired investigators for the Arizona attorney general said even veteran prosecutors recoiled when they viewed the 24 minute video   It was like a homemade horror movie   said Charles Loftus  the former assistant chief agent    I couldn t sleep at night after seeing that   said Matthew Parker  another former agent who says he retired with a disability   post traumatic stress disorder   related to his work on the case   It looked like a junkyard chop shop where they are just ripping things apart   INTERNING AT BRC Kazemi also spent Saturdays in BRC s lab teaching college students about dissection   On one Saturday in late 2013  ASU junior Emily Glynn said she showed up for her first day at the lab  She was majoring in nutrition   I was really surprised when I got the internship because I didn t have any experience   said Glynn  then 20   Just went in the first day and learned things on the job   That first day  under Kazemi s direction  interns used pliers to remove fingernails from donors  Glynn recalled    I don t want to say it was barbaric  but it was weird   she said   One day  I found myself holding the hand of a 70 year old woman and felt like I needed to apologize to her  to say   I m sorry    Neither Glynn nor Kazemi knew how the fingernails were used  they said  and Reuters could not locate invoices for that order  But the news agency did identify fingernails from 22 other donors that were sold by BRC  They went to a North Carolina bioengineering research company  SciKon Innovation   SciKon CEO Randy McClelland said he was unaware that BRC was raided by the FBI  He said his business helps companies study how products enter the bloodstream through fingernails   Like new cosmetics that go on your skin   he said   On another Saturday  Glynn said  Kazemi gathered the interns around the body of another elderly woman    He says   Emily  you ve never cut off a head before  and everyone else has  so do you want to try    Glynn recalled   And I m  like   OK    As she held the reciprocating saw  Glynn said  Kazemi steadied her grip    It wasn t a full on chainsaw like you would see in a horror movie  but it was a smaller version   Glynn said   And then I just went for it  I was expecting lots of blood but there wasn t much to it  It came right off   she said of the woman s head  Kazemi said he doesn t remember helping an intern cut off a head or any other body parts  The Saturday sessions  he said  were more akin to lectures during which he showed interns various organs and other body parts   In her senior thesis  Glynn described her time at BRC differently   Over the course of the internship  I stripped subcutaneous fat from the vertebrae of a cervical spine  practiced performing cricothyrotomies  incisions to the throat   sutured dismembered legs using an oversized needle and twine  and decapitated an elderly woman with what looked and sounded like a chainsaw from  Home Depot   NYSE HD    Glynn wrote in her thesis   Not once did I receive formal training or instruction   BODY PARTS TO MIDDLEMEN BRC s customers were not always directly acquiring body parts from the broker for their own medical education  research or training programs  According to invoices  some customers were middlemen   brokers who resold or leased body parts originally donated to BRC  The consent forms gave BRC the discretion to choose its customers  but the forms did not state that body parts could be resold by third parties  In 2012 and 2013  BRC sold at least 961 body parts  including at least 224 human heads  to three such middlemen  One was Innoved Institute LLC  a Chicago area medical lab provider that also supplies human body parts  Innoved was among BRC s best customers  It received at least 32 shipments with 277 body parts  Innoved executives did not respond to requests for comment   Another was Rathburn  the Detroit area broker facing trial next month  He received at least 26 heads from BRC  Rathburn s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment   A third middleman was Biological Resource Center of Illinois  another Chicago area broker  Better known as BRC IL  it received at least 658 body parts from BRC  BRC IL operated independently from BRC  But it was also raided by FBI agents as part of the federal probe into suspected fraud against donors and customers  No one has been charged with a crime in the BRC IL matter  and executives there did not respond to requests for comment  One of the shoulders shipped to BRC IL came from the body of Robert Louis DeRosier  a casino security employee  He died at age 64 after a long battle with diabetes  His widow  Tama DeRosier  lives in a mobile home park in Mohave Valley  Arizona  She said her husband donated his body hoping it might contribute to diabetes research  She did not expect anyone to make money selling his remains   That s morbid   the widow said   Greed is a terrible thing   Russell Parker Jr  who helped care for his dying brother Todd  said he was surprised to learn from a reporter that BRC sold Todd s right knee and offered to sell Todd s head  Friends had recommended BRC  he said  And when the company returned his brother s ashes  everything seemed  all on the up and up  very professional    Shame on BRC for showing such disrespect   Parker said   That s so wrong  It s like trafficking   CONFUSED CONSENT The companion of one donor cited another area of confusion  BRC s use of the term  tissue   In sales pitches and on consent forms  body brokers commonly talk about retrieving tissue from donors  To the medical community   tissue  means any part of the body   from an organ to a torso   But in interviews with Reuters  family members of some donors said they believed  tissue  meant only skin samples  Though BRC did sell skin  those sales represented just 2 percent of its business  invoices show   Maureen Krueger said her partner of 42 years  Fidel Silva  told a female hospice worker in his final days that he wished to be cremated    And that s when she brought it up   Would you be interested in donating tissues    Krueger recalled   The way she understood it  Krueger said  a few skin samples would be removed for research purposes  In return  BRC would cremate Silva for free  Silva  a 69 year old construction worker with a high school degree  peppered the hospice worker with questions    He asked   Well  are you sure  What are they going to do    Krueger said   He wanted to know  And that s when she assured him it was only body tissues  they only took samples  they didn t remove any organs or parts or anything  It was just tissues  And that s when Fidel agreed   The conversation took place at the Hospice of Havasu in Arizona  Its executive director  Dan Mathews  said he could not discuss the matter due to patient privacy laws  But he said the hospice  which offers its clients options to donate their bodies to science   removed that company BRC from our list of providers  upon hearing it was under investigation   Internal BRC records show the body broker removed Silva s head  and his right and left arms from shoulder to hand  Each was tagged with a tracking number and prepped for sale   Wow   Krueger said   I didn t really realize they could do all that  I mean  I didn t understand that s what would happen with Fidel at all   BODY PARTS IN LIMBO  After the raid of BRC by federal and state agents  the body parts seized by authorities remained in limbo for almost three years  Their fate  detailed in confidential state logs  sworn statements and photographs  has never been made public  Logistical problems began the day of the raid  said former agents Parker and Loftus  Authorities were stunned to find so much human flesh inside BRC  they said   We expected two freezers and a few hundred pounds of body parts   said Loftus  who s now running for state representative   Instead  we found 40 freezers with 10 tons of bodies and parts   Agents entered in hazmat gear and took biopsies from each body part to preserve as evidence  Records show the agents then placed the 1 755 parts into 142 body bags   The bags were sent to 10 local funeral homes so the remains could be cremated  But records and interviews show that BRC and others for whom it was storing body parts objected to their destruction  They argued that the parts had a value of more than  1 million   The cremation plans were put on hold  but authorities soon faced a pressing problem  according to former agents Loftus and Parker  Funeral homes could refrigerate but not freeze the body parts  and the mortuaries began to complain that some of the parts were starting to thaw  As a solution  authorities obtained three walk in industrial freezers and installed them at a military base used by the Arizona National Guard  Then  body bag by body bag  the mortuaries delivered the parts  and Loftus and Parker helped carry them into the freezers  In an interview  Parker recalled feeling body parts sloshing around inside the bags as he moved them  Some bags leaked blood that stained his pants and shoes  The experience led to his PTSD diagnosis  he said   It s not how you treat human beings  human remains   Parker testified in a deposition as part of his PTSD claim   You don t throw them in a bunch of body bags and then throw them into a freezer like a pile of garbage   The spokeswoman for the Arizona Attorney General s Office said the body parts were kept for federal authorities  as evidence in ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions across the country   An FBI spokesman declined to comment  In February  after almost three years in the containers  the remains were cremated and returned to families that requested them  the state spokeswoman said  In response to the Gore case  the Arizona governor signed into law a bill that requires body brokers like BRC to be licensed and regularly inspected  The new law calls for brokers to follow a set of standards and to hire a medical doctor to supervise company practices  
Although the law was adopted a year and a half ago  it has yet to be enforced  The state health department still must create specific rules for brokers  It isn t clear when it will  Health department officials  said a spokeswoman   do not have an anticipated date of completion at this time    Shiffman reported from Phoenix and Washington  Levinson reported from Phoenix and New York  Grow reported from Atlanta  Edited by Blake Morrison ",2017-12-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/special-report-a-business-where-human-bodies-were-butchered-packaged-and-sold-1032485,1032485
162781,384297,HD,Is This The Calm Before The Storm ,opinion,"Florence  now a tropical depression  made landfall in North Carolina on Friday  bringing with it destruction and calamity  the cost of which could top  170 billion  according to analytics firm CoreLogic  If so  that would make it the costliest storm ever to hit the U S  To date  2005 s Hurricane Katrina holds the top spot  costing an estimated  160 billion  followed by last year s Harvey   125 billion  and Maria   90 billion  
Not to minimize the impact Florence will have on millions of Americans  lives  but storms  even of this size  have rarely triggered major equity selloffs  According to research firm CFRA  in the last 15 years  the S P 500 Index declined an average 0 2 percent in the month after a hurricane  but was up an average 3 9 percent in the subsequent three months  Home improvement companies such as Home Depot  NYSE HD  and Lowe s could be beneficiaries  while insurance companies might take a hit 
Markets are subdued right now  with the S P 500 having gone more than 55 days without a 1 percent move in either direction  Trading volumes are also lower than average  suggesting Wall Street is in wait and see mode before making major adjustments 
Could this just be the calm before the storm 
Consumers And Small Business Owners Are Feeling Good
Appropriately enough  Florence comes to us on the 10 year anniversary of Lehman Brothers  collapse  the spark that set off the financial crisis reminding us it s never the wrong time to prepare for such a catastrophe   I ll have more to say on Lehman later   That includes now  even as a raft of positive economic data was released last week  The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index climbed to 100 8 in September  against expectations of only 96 6  This was its second highest reading since 2004 
What s more  the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index soared to 108 8 in August  its highest level ever in the series  45 year history  As the tax and regulatory landscape changed  so did small business expectations and plans   commented National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB  president and CEO Juanita Duggan 
Against this background  Nobel laureate Robert Shiller told Bloomberg last Thursday that the market  could get a lot higher before it comes down  It s highly priced  but it could get much more highly priced  It s a risky market now  
Time To Get Defensive 
Ray Dalio has a slightly different perspective  The billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates  the world s largest hedge fund  reminded investors last week that we re in the  seventh inning  right now  and as such  investors should probably get  more defensive   Recently I shared with you that the global purchasing manager s index  PMI  is steadily slowing down  falling to a 21 month low of 52 5 in August 
Again  markets have been relatively tranquil for a while now  but just as people on the East Coast were urged to prepare in anticipation of Florence  now might be the time to adjust your portfolio in advance of a possible market downturn  Last week  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  reported that its bull bear indicator  which gauges the likelihood of a bear market  climbed to its highest point since 1969 
Goldman analysts point out  however  that the indicator could be read to mean not that a bear market is right around the corner  but that a period of lower returns could be expected 
One of the ways investors could batten down the hatches  so to speak  is with gold  which historically has performed very well in September as we approach Diwali and the Indian wedding season  Last week I had the privilege to join Liz Claman on FOX Business  Countdown to the Closing Bell  and I told her that  under the circumstances  gold is doing exceptionally well  The precious metal may be under pressure from a strong U S  dollar and higher Treasury yields  but in Japan  Germany and elsewhere  government bond yields are negative  which has boosted gold demand 
What Caused The Lehman Bankruptcy  A New Accounting Rule
Before my interview  Liz spoke with the very man who was called in to conduct forensic accounting on Lehman Brothers  bankruptcy  Anton Valukas  The fourth largest U S  bank at the time of its demise  with  85 billion worth of mortgage backed securities  Lehman resulted in global market cap erosion of  10 trillion in October 2008 alone 
Among the most eye opening comments Valukas made during his interview is that  the federal government knew everything Lehman was doing its risk exceedances  and  the fact that they did not have a liquidity pool   According to Lehman s 10 K from November 2007  the bank was leveraged an incredible 30 7 times its net worth  up dramatically from 23 7 times only four years earlier 
 Why were there no prosecutions or civil suits   Valukas asked  Simply put   The government knew  
Some of the blame is also owed to an accounting rule  FAS 157 also known as  mark to market   or  fair value accounting  that was enacted in November 2007  A year later  after Lehman had sent global markets in a tailspin  FAS 157 was already being fingered by some as the culprit 
William Isaac  the former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  FDIC   said before the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  that the bankruptcy was  due to the accounting system  and I can t come up with any other explanation   Steve Forbes  chairman of Forbes Media  called mark to market accounting the  primary reason  for the meltdown 
I m in agreement  writing back in March 2009 that  a case could be made that the convergence of FAS 157  highly leveraged balance sheets and the loss of the uptick rule were the trigger that set off the financial meltdown  
The Financial Accounting Standards Board  FASB  proposed more lenient accounting guidelines in March 2009 the same month the market bottomed and began to recover  Coincidence 
So not only did the government allegedly allow the meltdown to happen  it then used taxpayer money to bail out the banks  which I believe exacerbated economic anxiety and sewed further distrust in the beltway party 
In my view  this contributed to two things  bitcoin  and the election of Donald Trump  Many people s faith in traditional banking was obliterated  opening up the opportunity for a new type of currency  a cryptocurrency  to fill 
As for Trump  I wrote last year that the  bully   as some call him  was elected to take on even larger bullies in the beltway party career bureaucrats  regulators and other entrenched officials who make it their mission to oppose any Washington outsider who threatens to shake up the status quo  They were hostile to President Jimmy Carter  a fellow outsider  and today they re just as hostile  if not more so  to Trump 
The Short End Is Your Friend
On a final note  with interest rates on the rise  it s important to stay on the short end of the yield curve when investing in fixed income  as shorter maturity yields are less sensitive to rate increases than longer term bonds  This is one of five reasons why I think it makes sense to invest in municipal bonds right now                                                           All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice  Some of these opinions may not be appropriate to every investor  By clicking the link s  above  you will be directed to a third party website s   U S  Global Investors does not endorse all information supplied by this these website s  and is not responsible for its their content ",2018-09-17,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-this-just-the-calm-before-the-storm-200344251,200344251
162782,384298,HD,2 Reasons Home Depot Is A Smart Defensive Play Even After A Massive Rally,opinion,"Finding the right defensive retail stock for your portfolio keeps getting tougher  Brick and mortar retailers are facing a tough frontal attack from online disruptors such as Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   which increasingly threatens their survival 
Indeed  over the past decade there has emerged a graveyard filled with an assortment of marquee retailers who failed to figure out a way to survive in an environment where each year shoppers were making fewer and fewer trips to malls  and millennial consumers were finding it increasingly convenient to order online  Among the growing list of retail failures and bankruptcies  however  there are still some success stories as well  The Home Depot  NYSE NYSE HD  is one of them 

The hardware and household improvement chain has proved many forecasters wrong about its management s ability to come up with a hybrid business model where e commerce strategies can help supplement brick and mortar operations 
Home Depot has delivered year over year comparable sales growth for 29 straight quarters  This consistently strong performance over such an extended period is obviously noteworthy  Quarterly sales growth has been more than 4  for the bulk of that time  It indicates that this big box retailer is pursuing an extremely successful growth strategy 
Its stock price is clearly reflecting that strength  During the past decade  Home Depot shares surged about seven fold  compared to 188  gains in the benchmark S P 500 Index  Over the past 12 months  HD stock rose 28   about double the gains delivered by the benchmark index 
Currently trading at  207 60 as of yesterday s close  the stock is barely 4  below its record high of  215 43  Does it make sense to buy Home Depot shares after such a powerful rally  The short answer is yes 
We believe it s a great defensive stock to own if you want to play the strength of the US economy and earn decent dividend income  Here are the top two reasons why we like this stock 
1  Successfully Fending Off the Amazon Threat
Home Depot is one of those retailers that are best positioned to survive an ongoing onslaught by the e commerce giant  The reason  HD management figured out early on how to thrive in this challenging environment 
With 90  of Americans already living within 10 miles of a Home Depot store  rather than opening new locations  the company instead focused on upgrading its existing store base with better technology and e commerce fulfillment capabilities 
By strengthening its relationship with its most loyal customers and improving its online delivery operations  HD has been successful in retaining customers  For example  HD is spending heavily to incentivize its customer network of contractors whom it calls  pro   According to Carol Tom   Home Depot s chief financial officer  these pros only comprise about 3  of Home Depot s customer base  but they account for about 40  of its sales  The retailer is making sure it stocks brands that these contractors like and is making it easier for them to pick up online orders quickly at stores 
Another factor favoring this home improvement retailer  this segment has been least affected by the Amazon disruption  Only 5 2  of hardware and home improvement sales occur online  while 27  of apparel and accessories sales are completed through online channels  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
2  Roaring US Economy  Housing Strength
Investing in Home Depot is also a good way to play the strength of the US economy  Rising home prices  which are near their pre housing bust peaks  are encouraging homeowners to spend on home improvements projects  such as installing new kitchens and remodeling bathrooms 
And Home Depot is reaping the benefit of these good times  In the second quarter  its comparable sales rose 8  over a year earlier  a strong jump that exceeded analyst expectations  For the full year  Home Depot raised its guidance  expecting a 5 3  increase in comparable sales and  9 42 diluted earnings per share 
The last big housing recession  which began in 2006  has prepared the company to deal with economic cycles more effectively than other retailers such as Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   During that period  Home Depot developed rapid deployment centers throughout the US that were critical to the company s plan for managing distribution and inventory more efficiently  Previously  Home Depot had simply used its stores as warehouses 
Bottom Line
Home Depot stock has had a remarkable run over the past year  But if you factor in its future growth potential  this stock still looks attractive  Plus  with its forward price to earnings multiple of 24 3  it doesn t look expensive 
As well  this retailer is a reliable dividend payer  Its quarterly dividend is currently  1 03 a share  for a yield of just under 2   with a healthy payout ratio of 45 18   Even more encouraging  Home Depot has raised its dividend more than 350  during the past decade 
This is a stock that should definitely be on your radar  even if you don t want to enter the trade at these high levels  If that s the case  keep an eye out for the next dip  It just might give you a good opening ",2018-10-02,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/home-depot-200346475,200346475

162797,384313,HD,Opening Bell  Turkish Contagion Fears Plague Global Markets  USD  Yen Jump ,opinion,"Turkey s central bank fails to boost lira after Erdogan s defiant speech


Investors sell off equities  EM FX on contagion fears  rotate into USD  yen  Treasurys


WTI prices fluctuate between contrasting themes


Key Events
Global stocks sold off alongside futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 on Monday  as investors fret over contagion risks from Turkey s economic crisis and sought refuge in the dollar  the yen and US Treasurys 

The Turkish central bank s intervention to boost liquidity  which comes after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan s defiant speech on Friday  fell short of sparing the lira from hitting a fresh record low its seventh within the last eleven sessions as fears over the country s fiscal and current accounts deficit deepened  Erdogan had recently pressured policymakers to keep interest rates low  even the inflation hit a staggering 16 percent growth rate in July 
The STOXX 600 dropped 0 4 percent to a three week low in early European trade and the Dow Jones EURO STOXX Banks lost 1 41 percent to a six week low  both dragged lower by European banks  exposure to Turkish risk  Spain s bank BBVA  Italy s UniCredit and France s BNP Paribas were down 3 49  3 37 and 1 07 percent respectively at 10 33am GMT

Global Financial Affairs

US majors sold off Friday  giving up their chance to seal a sixth consecutive weekly advance  The S P 500 slid 0 71 percent  led by Materials   1 44 percent   the sector most directly impacted by tariffs headwinds  The only bright spot was Energy   0 61 percent   which tracked the price of crude higher 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0 77 percent and the NASDAQ Composite retreated 0 67 percent  Domestic stocks listed on the Russell 2000 outperformed their larger cap counterparts  with the index limiting losses to 0 24 percent 
In FX markets  contagion worries sent emerging markets currencies lower  The South African rand hit its lowest intraday level since 2008  when investors rushed to the US dollar  Interestingly  investors have shunned gold as a safe haven for some time now  due to rising interest rates in the US 

The Dollar index reached 96 50  a yearly high  extending an upside breakout to a bullish ascending triangle  where demand has been outpacing supply 

The price of oil has been swinging between gains and losses amid ongoing fears of Iranian supply glitches on one side and signs of a potential increase in American output on the spreading Turkish crisis  WTI crude jumped about 1 25 percent on Friday after it reached an uptrend line since mid February

Last seen slightly higher at  196 56  HD has been moving higher on the charts since bottoming out near  170 and the 200 day moving average in early April  More  recently  the stock has been moving sideways  stuck between  204 and a floor of support near  194  right above the year to date breakeven point

162799,384315,HD,Opening Bell  U S  Futures Bounce Back  USD Jumps  Bitcoin Stumbles,opinion,"Europe  US futures rebound on Turkish lira s 7 5 percent jump


Dollar bounces back to 14 month high  then eases


Bitcoin tumbles  hovers near  6000 mark

Key Events
Stocks in Europe and US futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 crawled higher on Tuesday  shaking off the broad selloffs that continued to dampen Asian trade  This apparent positive reversal suggests bears are now hesitant  while bulls are buying the dips 
The pan European STOXX 600 halted a two day two day selloff  helped by bank shares  These benefited from dip buyers  appetite for Monday s selloff  which was sparked by fears of lenders  exposure to Turkey 
Investors  newfound confidence tracks the whopping 7 5 percent intraday rebound in the lira  However  the Turkish currency is still more than 30 percent lower in the last two weeks alone 
In the global opening session  Japan s TOPIX outperformed its regional peers  surging 1 65 percent  boosted by a weakening yen  Any help Japan s export dependent economy can get during a trade war is sure to boost its corporates  whether on fundamental merit or sentiment 
Meanwhile  a triple economic disappointment in China  with retail sales  industrial output and fixed asset investment all growing by less than forecast in July  underpinned the need for more policy stimulus in the country  even amid intensifying trade risks 
This could have a dual negative impact on financial markets  First  a slowdown in the world s second largest economy could curb global growth too  Second  there s a risk that any Chinese setback could encourage US President Donald Trump to ramp up his tariffs strategy  heightening global trade headwinds 
Mainland Chinese shares still managed to perform relatively well  as the Shanghai Composite limited losses to 0 18 percent  Hong Kong s Hang Seng slipped 0 66 percent  South Korea s KOSPI climbed 0 47 percent  Australia s S P ASX 200 gained 0 76 percent  outperforming once again 
Global Financial Affairs
In the US session  the S P 500 slid 0 4 percent  with Materials losing roughly a percentage point  for a two day slide of 2 43 percent  in a sign that sectors sensitive to trade tariff jitters are still leading the selloffs 

Technically  while Material SPDR XLB dropped below its rising channel since July  it closed above the support of an exceptionally bullish hammer posted August 2  the bounce demonstrates that demand is still there 
Energy shares underperformed  falling 1 30 percent after WTI crude slipped as much as 2 percent lower  However  the commodity later trimmed losses to 0 36 percent  forming a solid hammer  It was seen 0 82 percent higher at 10 06 GMT today  confirming yesterday s exceptionally bullish hammer 
The third worst performing sector was Financials   0 95 percent  amid mounting Turkish contagion worries  Investors feared the crisis could spread to US banks  while these haven t got any direct exposure to Turkey  they re still indirectly exposed via Europe  Still  some analysts think that the selloffs are entirely sentiment based 
Meanwhile  the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0 50 percent and the NASDAQ Composite retreated 0 25 percent 
The Russell 2000 underperformed  editing 0 68 percent lower  While weakness in the Materials sector and the Dow Jones suggests that trade headwinds are still playing on investor mind  the underperformance of small cap stocks  which are less exposed to those same headwinds  is surprising 
Moreover  domestic companies are not exposed to emerging markets  which are taking a beating from the spillover of the Turkish crisis  Our educated guess is that smaller investors  who count for a large share of smaller cap stock demand  were put off by the general risk off mood yesterday and shied away from the market 

Yesterday s risk off mode prompted a dollar selloff  in contrast with the USD s recent success as both a safe haven and a growth asset  However  today s more stable market conditions allowed it to jump back to a 14 month high  recouping most of yesterday s setback  as yields on 10 year Treasurys crossed above the 2 9 percent threshold 
While the rebound helped confirm the greenback s status as the quintessential growth currency  as well as the integrity of its ascending channel  it was seen back below neutral levels at 10 37am GMT 

Bitcoin dropped below  6 000 to the bottom of a descending triangle since February  a little over 2 percent above its June 24   5 762 9 trough the lowest since the near  20 000 December peak

162800,384316,HD,Options Traders Set A Ceiling For Cisco Systems Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ CSCO  stock is up 0 4  at  43 92 in afternoon trading  as traders prepare for the second of three blue chip earnings reports this week  Cisco Systems is set to follow Home Depot  NYSE HD  into the earnings confessional  with the tech company scheduled to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings after the market closes tomorrow  Aug  15  Below  we will take look at how CSCO has been faring on the charts  and what the options market is pricing in for the stock s post earnings moves 
Cisco Systems stock notched a 17 year high of  46 37 on May 10  However  the shares gapped lower after the company s mid May earnings release  and subsequently embarked on a journey of lower lows  CSCO found support in the  41 region  which contained an April pullback and is home to the equity s 200 day moving average  The Dow name is up 14 7  year to date 

Looking at Cisco Systems  earnings history  the stock has closed lower the day after the company reported in five of the last eight quarters  including the aforementioned 3 8  drop in May  Looking back eight quarters  the shares have moved 4 1  the day after earnings  on average  regardless of direction  This time around  however  the options market is pricing in a larger than usual 6 8  move for Thursday s trading 
In the options pits  CSCO s Schaeffer s put call open interest ratio  SOIR  of 0 74 ranks in the 37th annual percentile  This relatively low SOIR reveals that calls outnumber puts by a slightly wider than usual margin among options set to expire within three months 
Looking closer  the overhead August 45 call is home to peak open interest in the front month series  with more than 20 000 contracts outstanding  However  it appears a healthy portion of the August 45 calls were actually sold to open  This indicates options traders expect the  45 level    which coincides with where CSCO was trading prior to the May bear gap    will hold as a short term ceiling for the shares 
Analyst sentiment is extremely bullish toward Cisco Systems stock  Of the 18 brokerage firms following the blue chip concern  16 sport  buy  or  strong buy  ratings  Plus  CSCO s average 12 month price target of  49 56 represents 12 7  upside to current levels  and is in territory not charted since 2000 ",2018-08-15,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/options-traders-set-a-ceiling-for-cisco-systems-ahead-of-earnings-200338704,200338704
162807,384323,HD,Home Depot Remains A Better Value Than Lowe s,opinion,"After Lowe s Companies Inc  NYSE LOW  and Home Depot  NYSE HD  reported their Q1 results  there was no shortage of analysts who came out stating Lowe s was a better value with more upside than Home Depot  They argued that the softness that the company experienced in Q1 was entirely weather related  and Lowe s has way more runway to capture market share  From the investments the company continues to make in its logistics and supply chain to the growth with their Pro Customer base  the Lowe s bulls saw the dominance by Home Depot as coming quickly to a close 
However  putting Lowe s value  efficiency  and growth into context  it becomes clear that unless Lowe s starts growing its revenues at a double digit pace  they will continue to be second choices stock 
The Lowe s Value Trap IllusionIf an investor quickly looked at a comparison of some basic valuation and profitability measurements for Lowe s vs  Home Depot  they might be inclined to think Lowe s is a bit of value  They trade at a lower multiple on P E  Price Sales  Price to Cash Flow  Price to Earnings Growth  even Price to Forecasted earnings  Further  Lowe s delivers a gross margin that s nearly identical to Home Depot s 

Going a bit deeper  the company offers  5 42 Tangible book per share  or effectively 5 5  of the current share price  Cash flow is  6 48 per share or approximately 6 5  of the current share price compared to Home Depot who offers  3 02 per share or 1 5  of the current share price  To most value investors  the protection that Lowe s seems to provide for a growing retailer would be extremely appealing  Yet  looking into the numbers a bit closer  we find that there are significant reasons why Lowe s shares are priced as they are  namely productivity and growth 
Home Depot s Value Lies In ProductivityWhat Lowe s bulls often miss is not the room that Lowe s has to grow  but the way in which it grows  Consider that on average Home Depot puts out  42M per store  while Lowe s sits at  30M per store  That measurement effectively says that for every store Home Depot runs they get nearly 1 3rd better revenues than an average Lowe s store  This is further backed up by the fact that not only does Home Depot put out 1 3rd better revenues per square foot than Lowe s  but also that if you go back to 2013  you realize the company still had higher revenues per store than Lowe s does today  This may have something to do with why Home Depot boasts a current Return on Assets of 19 70 vs  Lowe s at 10 08 

Looking back at the Net Margin  part of the reason the companies differ substantially from Gross Margin to Net Margin is the SMG A costs  As a percentage of revenues Home Depot runs around 17  18   while Lowe s runs 22    Again  the evidence points to Home Depot being the more efficient company in how they grow their sales 
Lowe s Falls Behind In The Online WorldAlthough Lowe s doesn t see their business being eroded by the likes of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   they should be worried about Home Depot s role in the online marketplace  Lowe s boasted some pretty solid numbers in online sales growth  with TTM at 30 8   which tops Home Depot s increase of 21 8   In fact  Lowe s has beaten Home Depot every year since 2014  But let s put this into some context 

Currently  Home Depot s online sales represent 7 3  of their total sales  Lowe s is just over half of that at 4 3   The growth numbers that Lowe s put up every year haven t been enough to eclipse Home Depot  On the whole  they ve barely kept up  What makes this extremely critical is both retailers have begun to focus heavily on their Pro Customers  with Lowe s having a dedicated website solely for those customers  However  despite all their efforts to date  they still haven t matched Home Depot  The large portion of online sales is  in part  why at the moment Home Depot generates more revenue per store than Lowe s 

Corporate Guidance ComparisonLook at the side by side of the EPS vs  the consensus and see if you can figure out which is Home Depot and which is Lowes  If you guessed that the one who consistently beats the earnings estimates was Home Depot  you re right 

Over the years Lowe s consistently overpromises and underdelivers  Recently  this has led to Marvin Ellison being appointed the CEO of Lowe s  You might remember him from JC Penny where he attempted to turn around a company that was destined for bankruptcy  Ellison isn t wasting much time to get the company on the right side of the market  With all the analysis provided  Ellison is the X factor for Lowes  If he can really turn the company  then on a relative basis  Lowes stands poised to make some solid gains on Home Depot 
Final ThoughtsAny analysis that digs past the cursory details of Lowe s value metrics would show that the company performs exceptionally poorly compared to Home Depot  although by no means is Lowe s a bad company  However  the stock price relative to Home Depot is entirely justified given what Home Depot delivers  even in its Q2 results  Lowe s can continue to exist as it currently is  Yet  without any fundamental shift in strategy and investment  they ll continue to be the little sibling to Home Depot ",2018-08-22,Sayat Kartabayev,https://www.investing.com/analysis/home-depot-remains-a-better-value-than-lowes-200339994,200339994

 Bloomberg  Time is the enemy of the volatility seller  according to Morgan Stanley 
The level of implied volatility is too low and the time it takes to generate sufficient income from volatility selling strategies too long for investors to profit from taking a negative position on price swings  strategists at the bank  including Phanikiran Naraparaju  wrote in a note to clients this week 
 We find that equity  credit  G10 FX and rates need two quarters of current carry levels to be protected from mean reversion in implied volatilities   the strategists said   The cycle is far too advanced to give volatility sellers enough time to be able to withstand this

162836,384352,HD,Home Depot Says Slashing Tax Deductions Won t Hurt Housing Boom,news," Bloomberg      Home Depot  Inc  NYSE HD   isn t buying the real estate industry s claims that a provision in the House Republicans  tax plan to reduce the mortgage interest deduction would cause U S  home prices to plummet 
 We don t see much of an impact   Home Depot Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said in an interview Tuesday after the retailer reported third quarter results   There is no real empirical evidence that suggests mortgage interest deductibility is at all correlated to home ownership  
The world s largest home improvement chain scours economic and housing data to come up with its forecasts  Home prices are especially a focus  because when they increase people spend more on their properties  And the retailer sees no signs that price increases will slow down for the next three years    even with a cut to mortgage interest deductions  This is due to millennials buying more homes  a growing economy and a housing shortage in many regions  Tome said 
Home Depot s outlook contrasts with that of the National Association of Realtors  which has said the House tax bill would cause prices to fall more than 10 percent  In a letter to members of Congress on Friday  the group said the plan    which would lower the tax exempt cap on mortgage interest to  500 000 from  1 million    would reverse more than a century of pro home ownership tax policy

Digging into its earnings history  LOW stock has posted a negative return the day after the last four reports  Overall  the stock has averaged a one day post earnings swing of 4 5  over the past two years  regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a slightly larger than usual 6 8  next day move  per data from

162844,384360,HD,Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights  Macy   s  Wal Mart  Amazon And Home Depot,opinion,For Immediate Release Chicago  IL   May 29  2018   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  Macy s   NYSE M    Wal Mart   NYSE WMT    Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Home Depot   NYSE HD   Can the Sunshine for Retail Stocks Continue Macy s shrinking footprint notwithstanding  it represents the department store space in this comparison chart  with Wal Mart and Home Depot standing in for the big box discount and home improvement spaces  respectively Macy s long standing troubles are far from over  but the company appears to be executing well in an otherwise tough environment  The stock s strong year to date performance  almost the same as Amazon s performance  is more a function of how low expectations had fallen for this department store leader rather than the discovery of a new formula that can help it compete better  That said  market participants appear to be moving away from the overly pessimistic narrative that didn t see any role for Macy s and its peers in Retail s future   Wal Mart shares have been struggling since late January 2018  with the market appearing unwilling to give it the flexibility and space that it routinely allows Amazon  Wal Mart is investing in its business  both in the brick and mortar assets as well as the digital side  and these investments tend to come at the expense of margins and profitability  The company s Q1 results were decent  but the positive same store sales growth and impressive ecommerce sales failed to impress skeptical investors focused on more evidence of margin pressures  The market likely also believes that the company overpaid for its India venture through the Flipkart purchase  All in all  the company has a good strategy in place to effectively compete with Amazon in the long run  But no one should be under any illusion about how long and expensive the struggle will be    Home Depot s mixed quarterly report can be legitimately chalked up to the weather  But the stock s year to date underperformance likely has more to do with the market s skepticism about the outlook for the housing space as a whole which has been dealing with low housing inventory and rising mortgage rates     Retail Sector ScorecardWe now have Q1 results from 89 5  of the retailers in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these Retail sector companies that have reported results are up  21 1  from the same period last year on  9 3  higher revenues  with 73 5  beating EPS estimates and 67 7  beating revenue estimates A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes  which was obviously a one off development  Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes  we would have seen only EPS estimates go up  with no changes to revenue estimates  But that wasn t the case  as revenue estimates had gone up as well  which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction Disappointingly  we are not seeing that with estimates for Q2 to the same extent  as the above chart shows  In other words  while the growth picture coming out of this earnings season is very impressive  there is not much improvement in expectations for the current and coming quarters  The recent uptrend in the exchange value of the U S  dollar and questions about global growth will likely serve as incremental negatives for folks like us monitoring the aggregate revisions trend This flat aggregate revisions trend notwithstanding  June quarter estimates have actually modestly ticked down for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors and gone up for 7 sectors  The

162854,384370,HD,Deadly Halloween attack in New York branded  terrorism  by authorities,news,"By Gina Cherelus and Daniel Trotta NEW YORK  Reuters    An Uzbek immigrant accused of killing eight people in New York City by driving a rental truck down a riverfront bike path on Tuesday appeared to have acted alone  but the Halloween Day attack had all the hallmarks of terrorism  authorities said  The suspect  who was shot by police and arrested moments after Tuesday s rampage on the Lower West Side of Manhattan  left a note saying he carried out the attack in the name of the militant Islamic State group  the New York Times and CNN said   The death toll paled in comparison to dozens killed in similar assaults last year in France and Germany  However  it was still the bloodiest single attack on New Yorkers since Sept  11  2001  when suicide hijackers crashed two jetliners into the World Trade Center  killing more than 2 600 people  The Twin Towers site was just a few blocks from the scene of the carnage left when the suspect swerved the pickup onto a path filled with pedestrians and bicyclists on a sunny  crisp autumn afternoon  Driving at speeds estimated at more than 60 mph  100 km h   the vehicle mowed down everyone in its path before slamming into the side of a school bus  The man then climbed out of the vehicle brandishing what appeared to be a pair of handguns before he was confronted by a city police officer  who shot him in the abdomen  Police said they recovered a paint ball gun and a pellet gun from the scene  The attack was over in a matter of seconds  Video footage taken by a bystander that circulated online showed crumpled bicycles scattered long the path  and at least two people lying on the ground  In addition to the eight fatalities  at least 11 people were hospitalized for injuries described by fire officials as serious but not life threatening  That excluded the suspect  who underwent surgery for gunshot wounds  Police declined to publicly identify the man  but a source familiar with the investigation said his name was Sayfullo Saipov  29  He reportedly lived in Paterson  New Jersey  a one time industrial hub about 25 miles  40 km  northwest of lower Manhattan  He had rented the pick up from a  Home Depot   NYSE HD  hardware store which  according to media accounts  was located in Passaic  just south of Paterson   To view a graphic on the location of the New York truck attack  click    FOREIGN CITIZENS AMONG DEAD Six victims were pronounced dead at the scene and two more at a nearby hospital  Police Commissioner James O Neill said  Five of the dead were Argentine citizens  visiting New York as part of a group of friends celebrating the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation  the Argentina Foreign Ministry said in a statement  Belgium s foreign minister said a Belgian citizen was also among those killed  A U S  law enforcement official described the suspect as a U S  immigrant born in Uzbekistan  a landlocked  predominantly Muslim country in central Asia that was once part of the former Soviet Union  CNN and NBC News reported that he entered the United States in 2010  Authorities late on Tuesday surrounded a house in Paterson where  according to the New York Times  Saipov was believed to have lived  Paterson  known for its large immigrant population  is home to about 150 000 people  including 25 000 to 30 000 Muslims  ABC News reported that Saipov had lived in Tampa  Florida  A check of court records related to a traffic citation that Saipov received in eastern Pennsylvania in 2015 showed he listed addresses then in Paterson and Cuyahoga Falls  Ohio  Although authorities from the mayor s office to the U S  Department of Homeland Security all swiftly branded the attack an act of terrorism  Governor Andrew Cuomo stressed that the suspect was believed to have acted alone   There s no evidence to suggest a wider plot or a wider scheme  These are the actions of one individual meant to cause pain and harm and probably death   Cuomo told a news conference two hours after the rampage  Asked later in a CNN interview whether the suspect had been known to authorities before the attack  Cuomo replied   It s too early to give you a definitive answer   The New York Times said investigators quickly recognized that Saipov had come to the attention of law enforcement in the past  It cited three officials as saying federal authorities knew of Saipov from an unrelated probe  although it was unclear whether that was because he had ties to someone who was under scrutiny or because he was the target of an investigation  CNN and other media outlets  citing police officials  reported that the suspect shouted  Allahu Akbar    Arabic for  God is greatest    when he jumped out of his truck  O Neill said only that an unspecified comment by the suspect when he exited his truck  and the general circumstances of the assault  led investigators to label the incident a  terrorist event   The Federal Bureau of Investigation joined the New York City Police Department and other agencies in a Joint Terrorism Task Force to conduct a probe of the attack  the FBI said in a statement  Despite the attack  thousands of costumed Halloween revelers turned out hours later for New York City s main Halloween parade  which went on as scheduled on Tuesday night with a heightened police presence just a few blocks away

162855,384371,HD,Strong Retail Sector Earnings Growth ,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points      The Retail sector s Q1 results show all the positives that have been seeing from most of the other sectors this earnings season        With results from 84 2  of the Retail sector s market cap in the S P 500 out  earnings and revenue growth is on track to be notably above other historical periods  though positive revenue surprises are not as numerous as had been the trend in other recent periods      For the 461 S P 500 members that have reported Q1 results already  total earnings are up  24 2  from the same period last year on  8 7  higher revenues  with 77 7  beating EPS estimates and 74 6  beating revenue estimates  The earnings season has ended for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors       Except for the proportion of these 461 index members beating EPS and revenue estimates  which are tracking roughly in line with the preceding quarter s level  growth in Q1 is notably tracking above historical periods      Looking at Q1 as a whole  total earnings are expected to be up  23 9  from the same period last year on  8 5  higher revenues  the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in 7 years  Net Income margins for the quarter are on track to expand by 1 5 percentage points  with the strongest gains at the Finance  Technology and Energy sectors       Q1 Earnings growth is in double digit territory from the year earlier level for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors  including the Technology and Finance sectors  The Auto sector has the weakest growth of all 16 sectors  with  0 3  earnings growth on  1 4  higher revenues      Energy sector earnings increased  75 7  from the same period last year on  14 2  higher revenues  Excluding the Energy sector  total S P 500 earnings growth drops from  23 9  to  22 2       For the small cap S P 600 index  we now have Q1 results 88 5  of the index s total membership  Total earnings for these companies are up  21 4  on  9 7  higher revenues  with 60 5  beating EPS estimates and 72 2  beating revenue estimates  In addition to earnings and revenue growth  revenue surprises are notably tracking above historical periods for the small caps      For the quarter as whole  total S P 600 earnings are expected to be up  18 2  on  9 8  higher revenues  We have more details about small cap data on page 28 of the full report      For full year 2018  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  19 4  on  5 8  higher revenues  For full year 2019  earnings are expected to be up  9 4  on  4 4  higher revenues      The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2018 P E of 17 5X and index close  as of May 17th   is  156 01  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  170 70 for 2019  P E of 15 9X  and  187 21 for 2020  P E of 14 5X   The multiples for 2018 and 2019 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year    Retail Sector ScorecardWith results from Wal Mart  NYSE WMT      Macy s     and Home Depot  NYSE HD     out now  we have Q1 results from the equivalent of 84 2  of the sector s market capitalization in the in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these Retail sector companies that have reported results are up  22 1  from the same period last year on  10 1  higher revenues  with 72 7  beating EPS estimates and 63 6  beating revenue estimates The comparison charts below put the sector s Q1 results in a historical context 

Please note that the Zacks Retail sector includes the online vendors and restaurant players in addition to  traditional  brick and mortar players The comparison charts above show that while growth  both earnings as well as revenues  is tracking notably above historical periods  the proportion of positive EPS surprises is in line with historical periods and revenue surprises are tracking below the 4 quarter average  but above the 12 quarter average  With respect to growth  Amazon s blockbuster numbers  particularly on the revenues front  has a big role in the very strong growth picture at this stage  Amazon s Q1 earnings increased  125  on  42 9  higher revenues  with the net dollar increase in the online retailer s revenues an impressive  15 3 billion The comparison charts below try to look at the sector s growth picture with and without the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  contribution 

The right hand chart that compares the sector s Q1 earnings and revenue growth on an ex Amazon basis shows that growth still compares favorably with other periods even without the online giant s considerable contribution Weak Revisions TrendWhile growth in Q1 has been very strong  analysts have been hesitant to raise their estimates for Q2  The fact is that aggregate expectations for the quarter have barely budged since the quarter got underway  as the chart below shows 

This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive revisions trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season  A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts  But the estimated trend had been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2  This didn t happen  as the above chart shows There is not much change to estimates for the second half of the year either  as the chart below shows 

Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the Q1 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods 

As you can see  the growth picture remains very strong  even though it is expected to decelerate in the coming quarters from Q1 s lofty level  The worrying part isn t the seeming deceleration  but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond  This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U S  dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market s less than enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results

162856,384372,HD,Greensky IPO  Will Fintech finally return ,opinion,"Investors finally have valuation details about Greensky s upcoming IPO  The Wall Street Journal reported that Greensky plans to offer about 34 1 million shares at a price range of  21 to  23  Greensky would be expected to raise about  700 million at the midpoint value  and would have a valuation of  4 2 billion 
Fintech IPOs in the past such as LendingClub  NYSE LC  and On Deck Capital  NYSE ONDK  have struggled since going public  and so Greensky will be facing a wave of skepticism  Greensky has some unique advantages which can help it buck the trend  but the company is richly valued at  22 and the share price will likely go up given the booming IPO market  While Greensky is not strictly speaking a bad investment  investors should wait before they consider jumping in on this company 
Examining The Company
Many fintech companies in the past have declared that their technology could help make banks obsolete  but Greensky s goal is to connect customers with banks  As the company details in its   it has created an ecosystem of merchants such as retailers and home improvement contractors  customers with good credit scores looking for a loan to finance projects such as home improvement  and banks willing to loan to customers  Greensky connects the three groups who mutually benefit  and notes that  from our inception through March 31  2018  merchants used our platform to enable approximately 1 7 million consumers to finance over  12 billion of transactions with our Bank Partners   A key here is that while Greensky connects the three groups  Greensky itself does not make any loans as it is a technology company  This means that the company is not directly impacted if customers default  and that Greensky would not be heavily impacted if the government consider more heavily regulating the fintech sector 
Furthermore  Greensky has plenty of growth opportunities  As Compli points out  customers in general and young customers in particular are increasingly relying on point of sale loans instead of credit cards to finance major purchases like home improvement  This is exactly the sort of transaction Greensky facilitates  and the company can move into other sectors beyond home improvement and healthcare to get additional customers  Greensky itself points out online retail as  an attractive and low cost acquisition channel ripe for penetration that fits synergistically with our existing point of sale mobile platform  
In addition to the potential for future growth  Greensky can point to solid growth right now  Revenue rose from  173 million in 2015 to  263 million and  325 million in 2016 and 2017 respectively  representing a growth rate of 52 and 23 percent  While the slowing growth rate is disappointing  that is overshadowed by the fact that Greensky is the rare tech IPO which is already profitable  Net income was  138 million in 2017 compared to  93 million in 2015 
Worth The Valuation  
Greensky is a profitable  rising fintech company which has a clear path towards future growth  but even all those good news does not necessarily justify a  4 2 billion valuation  Greensky had a little over  350 million in cash and  488 million in total liabilities as of the end of 2017  which means that we are looking at an enterprise value of about  4 4 billion and an EV sales ratio of 13 5 
Bloomberg points out that most large fintech IPOs have a ratio from 8 to 16  but that is still far richer than most established companies  And this assumes a share price of  22  If the share price and by extension valuation jump up immediately as has happened in most IPOs  then that ratio looks even worse 
Furthermore  Greensky does have some concerning issues such as competition  Traditional  larger credit card companies or banks could easily muscle in on Greensky s turf by connecting or offering point to sale loans  which limits just how much this company can grow  Greensky may talk of expanding into new markets  but it is overly dependent on a few merchants such as Home Depot  NYSE HD  for the majority of its business  And while Greensky may be more insulated from the threat of regulation compared to other fintech companies  it is by no means immune

Most tech IPOs in 2018 have started well  and Greensky will likely be no different  The company has a solid record of growth  can continue to grow  and is profitable  Those investors who can get in at a share price of  22 should feel good about themselves  But for everyone else  caution is advised  Greensky s valuation is at the upper bounds of where I would feel comfortable at  22  and would break those bounds if its share prices rise significantly higher  If the IPO hype is not strong or fades to the point that Greensky s price approaches the initial IPO price  then investors should consider giving Greensky an opportunity  But with so many other good companies going public  the prudent course of action is to wait ",2018-05-17,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/greensky-ipo-will-fintech-finally-return-200317044,200317044

The U S  stock market has seen volatility rear up in 2018  with major indexes experiencing wild swings on a nearly daily basis  There have been a number of causes often cited for the recent bout of turbulence  including concerns over inflation  geopolitical uncertainty  and the first quarter earnings season  but one of Wall Street s most prominent investment banks fingers one key culprit  Main Street

162876,384392,HD,Chart Of The Day  Here s How To Trade Home Depot After They Report,opinion,"Home Depot  NYSE HD  is expected to report earnings this morning  before the bell  with a  2 06 EPS forecast on a  25 23 billion revenue  However  the unofficial  whisper  on Wall Street is that we should be expecting an EPS of  2 11 
The US has seen an especially wet winter   among the ten wettest in the past 124 years  This is likely to dampen the company s report for the first quarter  However  the silver lining is that this means there is the likelihood of a big uptick in home improvement projects in the near future 
This view is supported by the Joint Center of Housing Studies at Harvard University   that home remodeling is expected to remain strong and steady into 2019  The estimate is that home improvements and repairs will reach about  337 billion in 2018  up 7 1  from estimated 2017 spending  A surge in remodeling permits suggests homeowners are increasing the number and the size of their home projects 
Today  global stocks including US futures took a decisive downturn  flipping off the risk on switch with a bang  This comes as a number of events add fuel to the geopolitical fire  The first is the eruption of violence in the Middle East  Additionally  trade worries still weigh on investors after Trump s attempt to help China s side of the trade spat was retorted with a backlash by   Lastly  the synchronized global growth narrative is being challenged again by a slowdown in China and Europe 
Should the downturn of US futures follow through into their underlying gauges  they may weigh on shares of Home Depot as well  irrespective of its earnings  A miss due to the harsh winter  spurring a short term selloff  would only exacerbate a broader risk off sentiment  This may provide a buying dip 

The late January broader selloff dragged shares of Home Depot down from  207 60 record high to a low of  170 42  posted both on April 2nd and 4th  The rebound from that low was on top of the 200 DMA  red   expressing the fact that investors might have considered it a bargain  Since then  the prices decisively crossed over the 50 DMA  green  on April 26  after encountering its resistance for five straight sessions 
The climb above it was the biggest one day jump this year  with a near 5 percent advance  That really solidified the flag pole of a pennant  a continuation pattern  or a bullish pattern after a sharp rally  The upside breakout included a crossover of the 100 DMA  blue  
Should prices fall  they may find a support for the  185 00 pennant area 
The pennant s flag pole ranges from  174 55 till  187 80  implying a  13 25 target 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders would wait for a full return move to retest the pattern s integrity with at least one green candle engulfing the preceding red candle  This would occur after the 3 percent penetration since the upside breakout satisfied a conservative filter to avoid a bull trap 
Moderate traders would wait for a return move for a better entry but not necessarily to retest the pennant s support 
Aggressive traders may enter a long position immediately  providing their account can withstand a whipsaw back to the  185 area or absorb a loss 
Equity Management
Stop Loss   184

162945,384461,HD,Tile Shop Insiders Scoop Up Shares,opinion,"New form 4 filings with the SEC have revealed that Tile Shop Holdings Inc  NASDAQ TTS  insiders have been selling large quantities of stock since last Thursday  With shares down  42 8  in the last 30 days  it s worth taking a closer look at the company Insider Buying  Tile Shop
A number of insiders have been buying shares of Tile Shop according to  with the SEC  Notable insiders include Peter Kamin  Chairman of the Board   Todd Kransnow  Director  and Peter Jacullo  Director   as shown in the table below  Total insider buying has totaled  3 7 million since last Thursday which is approximately 1 3  of Tile Shop s total market capitalization 
Peter Jacullo  Chairman  most recently bought  830k worth of shares on Monday  February 26th  This is what propelled me to take a closer look at the company s insider activity Potential Reasons For Insider Activity
Tile Shop operates as a specialty retailer of manufactured and natural stone tiles  setting and maintenance materials  and related accessories in the United States  Analysts covering the stock often compare the company to a peer group that includes Lowe s Companies  NYSE LOW   Lumber Liquidators Holdings  NYSE LL   Home Depot  NYSE HD  and Restoration Hardware Holdings  NYSE RH   Analyzing Tile Shop s valuation metrics and ratios relative to its peer group offers insight into why insiders may be buying their shares 
Projected 5 year EBITDA CAGR is the average annual growth rate of EBITDA over a five year period  It s calculated as follows 
5yr CAGR     EBITDA FY 5   EBITDA FY      1 5 years    1
The chart below plots the five year EBITDA compounded annual growth rate for Tile Shop vs  its peers  The company s projected 5 year EBITDA CAGR of 8 4  is above LOW  7 3    HD  6 5   and only below RH  27 6    Note that LL is not meaningful 
EBITDA margin measures the portion of revenue a company converts to earnings  It is a strong measure of a company s pricing power and capital efficiency  All else equal  companies with higher EBITDA margins command higher valuation multiples  Tile Shop s EBITDA margin of 16 7  is above all of its selected comparable public companies  LOW  12 1    LL   2 9    HD  16 6   and RH  7 9   
A company s EBITDA multiple is calculated by dividing its Enterprise Value by EBITDA and is often used to benchmark the fair market value of a company  Its key benefit over the P E multiple is that it s capital structure neutral  and  therefore  better at comparing companies with different levels of debt As illustrated in the chart above  Tile Shop s forward EBITDA multiple of 4 5x is well below all of its selected comparable public companies  LOW  11 7x   LL  26 8x   HD  14 5x  and RH  13 1x   Shares look highly attractive relative to its peers 
The company s shares last traded at  5 20 as of Monday  down  67 9  over the last year  While the stock has lost significant value  the recent insider transactions could signal a promising road ahead for shareholders 
In addition  finbox io s average fair value estimate of  6 73 implies 29 4  upside and is calculated from 8 valuation models as shown in the table below  Each analysis uses consensus Wall Street estimates for the projections when available 
How Should You Interpret this 
While executives are always happy to tell you all the reasons why their stock is a buy  their actions can tell a different story about the company s future prospects  A trend of buying activity may indicate that insiders think the stock is going up over the upcoming time period  and are trying to buy before the price rises 
Keep in mind that insider activity is only one aspect of stock research and that there are other important items to consider  I recommend you continue to research Tile Shop to get a more comprehensive view of the company s fundamentals by looking at 
Risk Metrics  what is Tile Shop s asset efficiency  This ratio measures the amount of cash flow that a company generates from its assets   
Efficiency Metrics  inventory turnover is a ratio that measures the number of times a company s inventory is sold and replaced over the year   
Forecast  what is Tile Shop s projected EBITDA margin  Is the company expected to improve its profitability going forward

1        Walmart Inc     NYSE WMT   
Discount supermarket behemoth Walmart is scheduled to release its latest quarterly report before the market opens on Feb  20  This stock tends to serve as a bellwether for the consumer economy  so investors will definitely want to pay close attention to its results  Shares of WMT have gained about 7  over the past 12 weeks 
WMT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Based on our latest consensus estimates  we expect the company to report earnings of  1 36 per share and revenues of  135 04 billion  which would represent growth of 4 6  and 3 1   respectively  The key to any potential surprise will be Walmart s continued e commerce growth  with an emphasis on margin expansion in this segment 
 
2        The Home Depot  Inc     NYSE HD   
Home improvement retailer Home Depot is slated to report its latest quarterly results before the opening bell on Feb  20  With a strong economy and housing market throughout the country  logic would imply that Home Depot could be ready to post an impressive report  but the exact details will be revelatory regardless  Share of HD have gained 8  within the past 12 weeks 
HD is holding a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  heading into its report date  According to our latest consensus estimates  the company is projected to post earnings of  1 62 per share and revenues of  23 67 billion  These results would represent year over year growth of 12 5  and 6 6   respectively

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is slated to release its latest earnings report after the bell on Feb  22  Things have been relatively up and down for HPE since its split from the former Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ  in late 2015  Still  the company is coming off two straight earnings beats  and a recent spin off could help improve margins 
Nevertheless  HPE is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   According to our latest consensus estimates  HPE is poised to post earnings of 23 cents per share and revenues of  7 03 billion  During the third quarter of fiscal 2017  the company sold its Software business to British firm Micro Focus  so the most important year over year comparison for investors to keep an eye on will be in the net margin category

162967,384483,HD,RY Vs  HSBC  Which Foreign Bank Is Better Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Key foreign bank earnings that are scheduled for release next week will likely to provide a better understanding of the sector s near term prospects  At present  the central short term concern for foreign banks will be one time U S  tax charges  which may adversely affect their full year profits  However  a lower U S  corporate tax rate is expected to favor profitability in the long run 
Barring this short term concern  an uptick in this year s global economic growth  projected by the World Bank  should infuse further momentum in the foreign banking space  which ended 2017 with a solid recovery after being a laggard for a long time  Particularly  the recovery witnessed by banks in advanced nations  fueled by an accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus of the central banks  could be self reinforcing in the quarters ahead    
In this context  HSBC Holdings  LON HSBA  plc   NYSE HSBC   and Royal Bank of Canada   NYSE RY   which are scheduled to report earnings results on Feb 20 and Feb 23  respectively  assume greater significance Both the foreign banks a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Other major stocks reporting earnings from Feb 19 to Feb 23 include Walmart Inc    NYSE WMT   and The Home Depot  Inc    NYSE HD   
Price Performance
Royal Bank of Canada has gained 10 1  in the last six months  but underperformed the broader  that has moved up 10 3  over the same period  In comparison  HSBC has not only outperformed the broader industry but is also ahead of Royal Bank of Canada  gaining 12 2  over the same time frame 

Valuation
Compared with the S P 500  the industry is clearly undervalued  This implies that the industry has upside potential for the near future The industry has an average trailing 12 month P B ratio   the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next   of 1 6  which is below the S P 500 s average of 3 73  Hence  it might be a good idea not to abstain from stocks belonging to this industry 

Coming to the two stocks under consideration  with a P B ratio of 1 08 HSBC is undervalued than the S P 500 and the industry  However  though Royal Bank of Canadais also undervalued compared to the S P 500  with a P B ratio of 2 25  it is pricier than both the industry and HSBC 

Dividend Yield
HSBC s dividend yield over the last year is 3 81   higher than the broader industry s figure of 2 6   With a dividend yield of 3 52   Royal Bank of Canada shareholders earn a slightly lower dividend yield than HSBC 

Return on Assets  ROA 
Return on assets  ROA  is one of the key financial ratios for banks as they rely heavily on their assets to create revenues  A positive ROA indicates that the company has reported gains from its assets for the period in question  Coming to Royal Bank of Canada and HSBC  ROA for the trailing 12 months  TTM  is 0 95  and 0 32   respectively  Royal Bank of Canada has a higher ROA than not only HSBC  but also the industry  which has ROA of 0 52  

Earnings History  ESP and Estimate Revisions
Considering a more comprehensive earnings history  Royal Bank of Canada has delivered positive surprises in three of the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 3 7   On the contrary  with a negative average earnings surprise of 21 1   HSBC loses this round to its rival
When considering   both foreign banks have an ESP value of 0 00   At the same time  Royal Bank of Canada s earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 2 7  over the last 60 days  while the same metric for HSBC has remained unchanged  
Conclusion
Our comparative analysis shows that HSBC holds an edge over Royal Bank of Canada when considering price performance  dividend yield and valuation ratios  However  when considering return on assets  Royal Bank of Canada holds an edge over HSBC 
Additionally  when we take a more comprehensive look at the companies  previous earnings performance and estimate revisions  Royal Bank of Canada is clearly the better stock  In this respect  it is evident that Royal Bank of Canada holds a slight edge over HSBC ahead of their earnings releases next week

162970,384486,HD,U S  Dollar Bounces Off 3 Year Low  Business And Consumer Surveys Are Next,opinion,"Here are the latest developments in global markets 
  FOREX  The dollar index traded 0 4  higher on Tuesday  drawing some support from an uptick in the yields of longer dated US Treasuries  The index rebounded on Friday after touching a fresh 3 year low  and has continued recovering since 
  STOCKS  US markets remained closed yesterday in celebration of President s day  Earlier on Friday  the S P 500 and the Dow Jones closed marginally higher  though the NASDAQ Composite fell 0 2   Moreover  futures tracking the S P  Dow  and NASDAQ 100 are currently in negative territory  suggesting that the turbulence in equity markets may still have some room to run  In Asia  most indices were flashing red today  Japan s Nikkei 225 and TOPIX closed 1 0  and 0 7  lower respectively  while in Hong Kong  the Hang Seng fell by 0 8  on its first day back from holidays  Chinese markets remain closed for the Lunar New Year festivities  In Europe  futures tracking the Euro STOXX 50 were little changed 
  COMMODITIES  Oil prices were mixed today  as the two major benchmarks moved in different directions  While WTI gained almost 0 2   Brent crude declined by roughly 0 4   While oil prices have recouped some of their losses in recent days  the outlook surrounding the oil market continues to be clouded by the continued surge in US production  On Friday  the US Baker Hughes oil rig count showed a further increase in the number of active oil rigs  providing a fresh signal that US output likely increased further from its record high 10 27 million bpd  In precious metals  gold was 0 5  lower on Tuesday  as the recovery in the greenback made the dollar denominated metal appear less attractive  
Major movers  De Guindos nominated for ECB Vice President  SPD votes on coalition government
Monday was relatively quiet in terms of price action  with most FX pairs seeing range bound trading as US and Canadian traders were away on holiday  There were a few interesting news developments though  most notably the nomination of Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos to succeed Vitor Constancio as the ECB s Vice President 
While De Guindos is not anticipated to rock the boat in terms of policy  the nomination of a Southern European as ECB vice chief has stoked speculation that the next ECB President after Mario Draghi may be from central Europe  perhaps German or French  This is significant  since nations like Germany and France have traditionally favored a tighter policy stance  Thus  if somebody like Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann is nominated to replace Draghi  then the ECB could well sail in a more hawkish direction over time 
Staying in Europe  today in Germany  the members of the SPD will begin voting in a postal ballot on whether their party should proceed with forming a coalition government with Merkel s CDU  The results are not expected until March 4  the day that Italy will also head to the polls to elect its next government 
GBP USD is nearly 0 3  lower today  extending the hefty losses it posted on Monday and Friday  A cocktail of soft UK retail sales  a recovering dollar  and some comments from the EU s top Brexit negotiator are the culprits behind the pair s recent underperformance  On Friday  EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK s red lines close the door to a Swiss or Norwegian model for Brexit  enhancing the narrative that these talks are still far from bearing fruit 
Elsewhere  the minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia s  RBA  latest policy gathering released overnight packed few surprises  Policymakers reiterated the key risks they see as clouding the economy s outlook  such as the high levels of household debt and the subdued growth in wages  Aussie dollar stumbled after the release  but recouped its losses to trade even higher in the following hours 
In trade news  the US Commerce Department recommended on Friday that the US imposes heavy tariffs on steel and aluminium imports  If enacted  such measures would probably escalate further the trade tensions between the US and China  not least because China has already warned it may retaliate to such an action  
Day ahead  Business   consumer confidence surveys and bi weekly milk auction on the horizon
The ZEW institute s surveys gauging economic sentiment and current conditions in Germany  eurozone s largest economy  will be made public at 1000 GMT  Both releases are expected to reflect a decline in February after January s surge  A related survey from the European Commission s Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs covering the whole of the euro area   February s flash consumer confidence   is scheduled for release at 1500 GMT  It also projects a dip in consumer confidence after rising to its highest since 2000 in January 
Out of the UK  the Confederation of British Industry s monthly order book balance  gauging factory activity  will be released at 1100 GMT  The measure is anticipated to further ease in February  in December it touched a near 30 year high as British manufacturers were supported by strong export demand 
New Zealand s bi weekly milk auction is due around 1400 GMT  the release is tentative  lacking a specific time of release  Dairy products are the country s largest goods export earner  thus kiwi pairs will be eyed as the reading goes public 
Canadian wholesale trade data for the month of December are scheduled for release at 1330 GMT 
Swedish central bank Governor Stefan Ingves will be talking about the economy and monetary policy at 1730 GMT 
As the earnings season continues  Walmart  NYSE WMT  and Home Depot  NYSE HD  will be among companies releasing results in the US  
Technical Analysis  NZD USD hits 6 day low  looks bearish to neutral in short term
NZD USD recorded a six day low of 0 7347 earlier on Tuesday  This compares to last week s  February 16  six and a half month high of 0 7436  The RSI has been declining following last week s high  though it seems to be consolidating around the 50 neutral perceived level at the moment  painting a bearish to neutral picture in the short term 
Stronger than expected dairy prices out of today s auction could lend some support to the pair  with price advancing potentially meeting resistance around 0 7385  this being the middle Bollinger line  a 20 period moving average line 
A weaker than anticipated release on the other hand  could see the pair extending its declines  The lower Bollinger band could be providing support at the moment  with a downside violation shifting the focus to the area around the 100 period MA at 0 7319 ",2018-02-20,XM Group,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-bounces-from-3year-lows-business-surveys-and-dairy-auction-due-200291934,200291934
162971,384487,HD,Opening Bell  Oil Surges  Bitcoin Wavers  Equity Rally Halts,opinion,"US markets reopen after Presidents  Day holiday


Yields and currencies drive markets


Focus on Treasury Auction 11 30 EST


Oil climbs above  62 as OPEC  Russia promise to support prices


Bitcoin caught between mixed news reports

Key Events
US markets were closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents  Day holiday  On Friday  US stocks listed on the S P 500  the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Russell 2000 extended a rebound to a sixth day  capping their best five day performance in five years 

New indictments related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections led to stocks paring back the stronger advance seen in the previous days  with the NASDAQ Composite which tends to react most strongly when investors flip the risk switch to either on or off the only major US index that ended the day lower  thus breaking a five day winning streak  Growth stocks were sold off  including Technology stocks  in favor of defensive stocks and safe havens 
The Russian government   as one would expect  Either way  the potential impact on US and  indeed  global stocks going forward will hinge on any further reaction or measure adopted by US officials  rather than from anything released by Russia 
As well  since 2016 s Brexit vote  equity traders have proven to be resilient to political risk  Then again  it s easy to consider it resilient when stock prices keep climbing  defying the laws of gravity  nevertheless  it s considered foolhardy when equities crash and market observers start wondering how they could have let things go this far  For a fuller analysis of US See Sunday s Week Ahead for a fuller analysis of last week s US stock activity 

Yesterday  Asian equities posted gains across the board  led mainly by Japan s TOPIX and Nikkei 225  Australia s S P ASX 200 and South Korea s KOSPI  also saw their best week since September 2016 
Japanese stocks helped propelling the gains  as they benefited from the weakening yen  A weaker currency cheapens a country s exports through the exchange rate  This has an even bigger impact on a country like Japan  whose economic growth is heavily dependent on exports  As well  stocks become cheaper to foreign investors  whose home currency can now buy more yen and therefore more shares  Markets in Hong Kong and China remained closed for the Lunar New Year 
While investors have been speculating about a potential balance sheet reduction by the Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda avoided discussing monetary policy in a parliamentary appearance  leaving traders guessing  Based on the central bank governor s track record  he is likely to stall as much as he can get away with  as such a statement would further strengthen a yen that is already excessively strong for a country so reliant on exports 
Ironically  despite Japanese exports posting 12 2 percent growth YoY  beating the 9 4 percent forecast quite handsomely  the yen retreated from a 15 month high on Monday as imports also climbed 7 9 percent  beating the 7 7 percent forecast  tallying Japan s first trade deficit in 8 months 

Since advances in Asian markets were mostly explained via the weaker yen  they were not indicative of a continued global rally from last week  led by US indices  That s why the STOXX Europe 600 index didn t participate in the gains but instead fell for the first time in four days  dragged down by auto and consumer stocks 
As opposed to what happened with Japanese stocks  which benefited from a yen hovering at pre Trump levels near a 15 month low  European shares suffered from the euro at its highest level since December 2014 

Already weighed down by a strong euro  it didn t help that the pause in US trading left European markets in the spotlight  leading investors to sell or even short European stocks 

This may be an appropriate time to appreciate the role of the downtrend in the dollar  which is at is weakest level since December 2014  in a mirror image of the euro and amid the strongest US equity rally since 2013  A weaker currency lowers the current account deficit  leading to increased demand by foreign investors  whose local currency enjoys a added buying power  The greenback is consolidating beneath a support line since May 2015  whose downside breakout may suggest a continuation of the decline  Notice how the 100DMA  blue  realigned itself with the downtrend line since November and the 50DMA  green  is catching up with the steeper downtrend line since December 
Global Financial Affairs
This morning  stocks are painting a different picture  suggesting last week s rally may have come to an end  The main Asian benchmarks declined alongside S P 500 Futures  while European shares are advancing 
Japan s TOPIX fell overnight  halting its recent rally its second strongest this year  Shares listed on Australia s S P ASX 200  South Korea s KOSPI and Hong Kong s Hang Seng also lost some ground  while the Shanghai stock exchange will remain closed until Thursday in observance of China s Spring Festival 
Stocks in Europe are in the green but posting paltry 0 25 percent gains  and stalling 

Focus will surely return to US Treasurys today  after yields rose to a four year high  setting off the worst two weeks in US equity markets in two years  A Treasury auction is scheduled for today at 11 30 EST with 3 month bills  4 week bills  6 month bills and  2 year notes on offer  Absent any other economic data  the auction is likely to be scrutinized for signs of how steeply US bond yields can continue their uptrend  as  at 2 9 for the 10 year  they are already set for their highest close since January 9 2014  while global bonds resumed a selloff 

The Reserve Bank of Australia  in the minutes of this month s policy meeting that inflation is expected to  only gradually  accelerate as the economy strengthens and wage pressures increase  The lukewarm announcement left traders guessing as to the trajectory of the Australian dollar  extending a range 

The price of WTI crossed over the  62 threshold for the first time in over a week  after investors learned yesterday that the OPEC Russia alliance may be extended beyond 2018  as the world s largest producers vowed to continue to support market prices  However  crude oil prices declined this morning  albeit remaining above  62  supported by the 50 dma  green   after the 100 dma bounced at the  58 level  The RSI is curving back down  demonstrating weakness in momentum 

Bitcoin climbed above the  11 500 mark for the first time since late January  as  revealed that new code  finally featuring full SegWit  Segregated Witness   will be unveiled in the next few days  The SegWit upgrade will allow administrators to separate signature data from transactions  unlocking more space to add additional transactions to the blockchain  
Bitcoin has since fallen  to  11 200  on newer cryptocurrency developments  BoE Governor Mark Carney told students at London Regent s University that Bitcoin failed two tests toward becoming an actual currency it s neither a medium of exchange nor a store of value 
This follows similar arguments made by analysts at UBS and S P Global Ratings as well as ECB executive board member Yves Mersch  who  for increasing regulations on cryptocurrencies  Augustin Carstens  general manager at the Bank of International Settlements  where central banks hold their accounts  slammed the alt currency earlier in the month as  a combination of a bubble  a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster  
Technically  the price of Bitcoin reached the top of a falling channel  where supply has been overcoming demand since December

162993,384509,HD,Didn t pay your Macy s bill  Expect a text from Citigroup,news,"By David Henry NEW YORK  Reuters    When consumers have trouble making ends meet  bills from retailers that have gone bankrupt or closed tend to go toward the bottom of the pile   The trouble for lenders like  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C  is that the debt is actually owed to them  Citigroup  the fourth largest U S  bank by assets  said on Friday that it is having trouble collecting on store branded cards  which is leading to higher losses  To reverse that trend  the bank has been stepping up its outreach to shoppers who finance purchases from chains like Macy s and Sears with Citigroup store brand credit cards which the bank has stood behind for more than a decade  The bank recently doubled the number of text messages it sends to borrowers   We ve begun to see some evidence of progress  but it s slower than what we had originally targeted   said Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach  He expects to charge off 4 6 percent of the store branded credit card portfolio this year  up from an earlier forecast of 4 35 percent  Credit cards is the only major consumer business in the United States that Citigroup has been trying to grow since refashioning itself after the 2008 financial crisis  It is an important lever for Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat to hit financial targets he has not yet met  Store branded cards are a special focus for Citigroup because they have generated strong profits lately  Last year  that slice of the card business contributed  1 26 billion worth of profits for Citigroup  some 8 4 percent of income from continuing operations across the entire bank  Investors and analysts have started to worry that Citigroup will experience ripple effects from growing problems in the brick and mortar retail sector  where bankruptcies  store closures  emergency financing and distressed acquisitions have become the norm  Citigroup appears to be most at risk from relationships with Macy s Inc  Sears Holdings Corp  Office Depot Inc and  Staples Inc   NASDAQ SPLS   Moody s Investors Service said in a recent report  Moody s expects such chains to be closing stores in coming years  The cards Citigroup issues for those chains often cannot be used elsewhere  so when stores close  customers are likely to spend and borrow less  analysts said  Another problem  Retailers generally expect banks to lend to less creditworthy customers than they do with general purpose cards  While retailers share in losses  they are ready to take more chances on loans in order to sell more merchandise  especially when they are struggling to generate revenue  People with FICO credit ratings of less than 660  which some consider the bottom for prime borrowers  accounted for 25 percent of money owned to Citigroup on store branded cards as of the end of March  That was twice the proportion inside the rest of the card portfolio  which carries the Citi brand  Citigroup has been trying to transition some store brand cards to the type that can be used at other merchants  The broader purpose store cards now represent one third of the bank s retail services business  Gerspach said  And while collections have gotten more difficult  Gerspach was optimistic that customers are still shopping  with spending up 2 percent on store branded cards during the second quarter compared with the year ago period  Gerspach said the spending increase shows store closings are not affecting the business  Charles Peabody of Compass Point Research   Trading predicts Gerspach will have to raise loss estimates again before year end  Citigroup s biggest competitor in private label store cards  Synchrony Financial  now expects losses in the 5 to low 5 percent range  up from earlier guidance of between 4 75 percent and 5 percent  he noted  Synchrony and Citigroup together have two thirds of the market as measured by outstanding balances  according to The Nilson Report     Citigroup s big bank rivals in general purpose credit cards do not compete in private label store cards  JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  exited the business after headaches from issuing cards for Circuit City  an electronics retailer that went belly up  Citigroup also considered jettisoning its store branded business as its loss rates hit 12 percent during the Great Recession  But it could not find a buyer at the right price  and within a few years it had started to produce attractive returns again  By 2013  Corbat was bolstering the business by acquiring a loan portfolio pegged to cards used at electronics retailer Best Buy  which is generally seen as coping well with the shift to internet sales  Competition for deals with the more promising retailers has heated up since then  When Citigroup renewed its deal with  Home Depot  Inc  NYSE HD  last year  it had to make concessions to the retailer  Income from the business dropped 17 percent in 2016  Picking the right retailer

163009,384525,HD,Nasdaq posts best first half since 2009 while Dow and S P close higher,news,"Investing com   U S  stocks made a subdued end to the first half of the year  as a trio of mostly upbeat economic updates suggesting that the economy would continue to strengthen failed to inspire a broad based rally 
Investors mulled over several economic updates  showing a slowdown in inflation which was mostly offset by U S  manufacturing and consumer sentiment data that topped expectations 
Core PCE  a key measure of inflation the Federal Reserve considers in its interest rate decisions  dipped to 1 4  year over year in May  from 1 5  in the previous month 
It was the third month in a row that inflation has dipped  leaving it well below the Fed s target of around 2  
Meanwhile  manufacturing activity showed no signs of a slowdown  after The Chicago Purchasing Management Index  climbed to 65 7  its highest since May 2014  from 59 4 in May 
Analysts had forecast a figure of 58 0 for June 
The upbeat manufacturing report came ahead of a report showing U S  consumer sentiment fell less than expected to 95 1 in June  from 97 1 in May

163019,384535,HD,Why WATT  LFIN  And 3 Other Trendy Stocks Are Soaring ,opinion,"Shares of several of the investing social media world s favorite stocks including Energous   NASDAQ WATT   and Longfin   NASDAQ LFIN   moved higher on Wednesday morning  Check out why these companies  along with three others  had investors excited today 
Energous
Shares of Energous opened more than 80  higher today after the company said federal regulator approved its  WattUp  wireless charging device  The Mid Field transmitter is capable of sending power to electronic devices at a distance of up to three feet  Its approval marks the FCC s first certification of power at a distance technology 
 Untethered  wire free charging    such as charging a fitness band even while wearing it    is exactly what consumers have been waiting for  We are now in a position to move our consumer electronics  IoT and smart home customers forward at an accelerated pace   Energous CEO Stephen R  Rizzone said in a press release 
Longfin
Longfin shares were up more than 8  through morning trading hours Wednesday  Last week  Longfin emerged as a cryptocurrency proxy stock after acquiring Ziddu com  a blockchain company focused on micro lending and warehouse financing 
Over the last several trading periods  we have seen stocks like LFIN respond to price movements in the major cryptocurrencies  However  Bitcoin has slipped more than 4  over the past 24 hours  while Ethereum has slumped about 1  and Litcoin has moved about 3 5  lower 
Still  these cryptos have recovered from Friday s massive sell off  and Longfin s subsequent rally could be a sign of renewed interest in crypto proxy plays 
Blue Apron
Shares of struggling meal kit delivery company Blue Apron   NYSE APRN   gained about 3 6  in morning trading  While there is no clear news inspiring today s trading  investors should note that the company s post IPO lockup period ended yesterday 
Lockup expirations tend to send young stocks lower  as employees cash out of their personal holdings and flood the market with new shares  However  with APRN at such a low price level right now  it is possible that the lockup expiration did not inspire mass selling  causing a slight rebound 
Advanced Micro Devices 
Advanced Micro Devices   NASDAQ AMD   shares popped over 2  in morning hours Wednesday  continuing their trend of unpredictability  Prior to today s gains  AMD had lost nearly 6  over the previous four trading periods  The stock appears to be testing a new support line near  10 per share  having dipped below this level briefly over the last month  Today s bounce appears to be a rebound from just below  10 50 
XPO Logistics
Shares of logistics services giant XPO Logistics   NYSE XPO   moved more than 4 5  higher on Wednesday morning  The moves comes on the back of reports that Home Depot   NYSE HD   has held internal discussions about an acquisition bid for the company over the past several months 
XPO has reportedly been targeted by Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   as a potential partner for its furniture delivery push  so Home Depot s interest could be centered on keeping the logistics company away from the e commerce king

163020,384536,HD,And Now The S P Crosses 2 700,opinion,"The first two trading days of 2018 have seen two milestones taken out  On Tuesday  the NASDAQ surpassed 7 000 for the first time ever  And now on Wednesday  the S P made history by closing above 2 700  With the Dow now less than 100 points from its own milestone of 25 000  could we go 3 for 3 tomorrow 
	Well  let s not get ahead of ourselves  There s plenty of good news to talk about today  especially each of the major indices finishing at all time highs  The S P advanced 0 64  to 2 713 1  the NASDAQ increased 0 84  to 7 065 5 and the Dow rose 0 40  to 24 922 7 
	Much of this strong start is a continuation of 2017  though it doesn t hurt to see some encouraging economic data as well  The ISM Manufacturing Index rose to 59 7  in December  compared to 58 2  the month earlier  Meanwhile  Construction Spending rose 0 8  in November to a new record of  1 257 trillion  The ADP Employment Report will be released tomorrow  followed on Friday by the ISM Non Manufacturing and the Employment Situation Report Large Cap Trader made the biggest splash in the portfolios on Wednesday  as John sold one stock for a triple digit profit and then bought three new ones  Meanwhile  Dave made moves in both of his services  cashing in two double digit winners ahead of earnings season in Surprise Trader and adding a stock from the hot energy space in Momentum Trader  Read about all this in the highlights section below Today s Portfolio Highlights 

Large Cap Trader  Sometimes you just take profits because you can  John doesn t see anything that says YY Inc   YY  is at a top  but what he does see is a big momentum winner with a triple digit return  The editor decided this was as good a time as any to cash in this  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  of Mainland China  for an impressive 107 4  profit 
	The move frees up 12  of the portfolio  and John immediately put half of that allocation back to work in the following three stocks  the remaining 6  will stay in cash   Each of these names have strong Zacks Ranks and are high up on the Zacks Industry Rank 
	  MKS Instruments  MKSI  makes instruments  subsystems and process control solutions for the semiconductor industry  among many other spaces   so it s a good play in the wake of the latest chip stock pullback 
	  Jones Lang LaSalle  JLL  is a full service real estate firm that should be a big beneficiary of the corporate tax cut 
	  Huntsman Chemical  HUN  is one of the largest global manufacturers of differentiated and commodity chemical products  and John considers it a no brainer from a quantitative perspective 
	Learn a lot more about each of these new buys in the complete commentary Surprise Trader  Earnings season is right around the corner  and Dave is getting ready to add a bunch of new names  In fact  he ll be adding at least two stocks later this week  With all this activity on deck  the editor decided to clear the slate  He sold Home Depot  NYSE HD  and American Eagle Outfitters  AEO  for gains of 15 6  and 11 6   respectively  Both of these positions were added in November last year  The portfolio is now empty and all set for the new season  Stay tuned   Momentum Trader  The energy sector is red hot right now in part because so much of the country is ice cold  Dave found a company that s uniquely positioned to benefit from this  The editor added Statoil  OL STL   STO  on Wednesday  which is an integrated oil and gas company  The stock has finally broken out of its  21 handle and Dave is  hoping to catch the elevator up a few floors ahead of its earnings report in early February   Read the full write up for more on this new addition Options Trader   Another great day in the markets to kick off what looks to be another great year  And all of the major indexes notched new all time highs in the process 
	 A few months ago  I forecast the S P closing at 2 717 by last year s end  With the market closing at 2 713 06  we were pretty close  In fact  we were only off by two trading days and less than 4 points 
	 But I believe 2 717 will be a distant memory by the time December 2018 rolls around  In fact  I expect 2 717 to be a distant memory in just a few months from now      Kevin Matras
	All the Best

163059,384575,HD,Dow Soars Past 24K  Finishes 8th Month In The Green ,opinion,"It s crunch time for the Senate tax bill  and the market was feeling pretty good about its chances on Thursday  How good  Each of the major indices jumped higher in the session  making new all time highs and crossing fresh milestones along the way 
	The Dow made the biggest news by closing well above 24 000 for the first time ever  The index soared 1 39  today  or more than 331 points  to end at 24 272 4  It was only about a month and a half ago that it first hit 23 000  Needless to say  it s at a new all time high  The S P also reached a new record with today s gain of 0 82  to 2647 6  The NASDAQ regained more than half of yesterday s  tech wreck  with an advance of 0 73  to 6874  it had lost 1 27  on Wednesday  
	This strong session also finished off another impressive month for the indices  The Dow gained 3 8  in November and the S P increased 2 8   marking eight month winning streaks for each  The NASDAQ capped off its fifth straight positive month with a gain of 2 2  
	In the portfolios  Large Cap Trader made several tactical changes by selling one name for a positive return and adding more to three existing positions  ETF Investor proved that it s not afraid of the retail sector by adding an ETF that invests in the top 25 U S  retailers  Finally  Options Trader added a straddle to a company that could move in either direction in the coming weeks  Read more in the highlights section below Today s Portfolio Highlights Large Cap Trader  With the market in rally mode  John decided to make a few tactical changes to the portfolio on Thursday  First of all  he sold the idling Deutsch Bank  DB  position for a return of approximately 10   Afterward  the editor added 2  to the portfolio weights of GlaxoSmithKline  GSK   Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb   NVO  and Lion s Gate Entertainment  LGF A  each  You may remember that these stocks were all bought together on October 19th  and John now wants to add equally to these  newish  positions  The additions also serve to lessen the portfolio s exposure a bit to chip stocks  which John has never been comfortable in chasing even before yesterday s selloff  The portfolio now has a small 1 2  in cash  Get more details on these moves in the full write up ETF Investor  Retail stocks have been rebounding nicely of late  and the strong start to this holiday season suggests that the momentum could continue  Neena plans to capitalize on this improvement by adding VanEck Vectors Retail ETF  RTH   which holds 25 of the largest U S  retailers  The fund has exposure to Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   of course  and brick and mortar giants like Home Depot  NYSE HD  and Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   which have weathered the  Amazon effect  better than most  This fund should benefit from the industry s increased investments in e commerce operations  The full write up has more on this addition Options Trader  Kevin likes Broadridge Financial  BR  and its industry  which is in the top 14  of the Zacks Industry Rank  Earnings estimates for this tech based outsourcing solutions company are mostly on the rise and its chart is showing a  beautiful  uptrend  Yet  the editor decided to add a straddle to the company because  despite its many positives  earnings estimates for next quarter are a bit lackluster and the RSI is showing some bearish divergence  In other words  there are reasons for this stock to go higher OR lower  Therefore  the editor bought to open a Jan 90 00 Call AND bought to open a Jan 90 00 Put  Read more in the complete commentary Momentum Trader   What can you say about the Dow s run other than   Holy cow   It s not even the range of the run that s been the most impressive thing for me rather the relentlessness  The worst pullback of this run has been from 21 169 down to 20 379  That s less than 4  to the downside  Even then  the index dipped below the 50 day but nearly hit the moving average during each day it traded below it  The last time the Dow was even within sight of the 50 day was September 8th 
	 With the moves higher this week the Dow seems to be accelerating  as if a giant magnet on 25 000 is pulling it higher  The 50 day and 200 day are beginning to separate from each other as both have a decidedly positive slope  This is beginning to go parabolic  The market is en fuego right now  After the rush of earnings season has subsided  the event risks are gone  This market only has one way right now  and that s up      Dave Bartosiak

163060,384576,HD,Zacks com Highlights  Home Depot  Primerica  Broadridge Financial Solutions And Chemours,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Dec 5  2017   Stocks in this week s article include  Home Depot  Inc    NYSE HD    Primerica Inc    NYSE PRI    Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc    NYSE BR   and The Chemours Company   NYSE CC   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Top 5 GARP Stocks to Scoop Up Right NowInvestors following the growth or value strategy are always on the lookout for stocks that are poised to see strong growth and are available at a discount  Growth at a reasonable price or GARP investing is a strategy that takes care of these criteria The GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on However  one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy  While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks  GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the

Research 4 GARP Stocks to Buy for Maximum ReturnsIf you are looking for maximum returns from a portfolio of stocks that offers the best of value and growth investing  try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy  It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive prospects The GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please

163135,384651,HD,Factors Likely To Decide L Brands   LB  Fate In Q3 Earnings,opinion,"L Brands  Inc    NYSE LB    a specialty retailer of women s intimate and other apparel  beauty and personal care products  is slated to report third quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 15 
In the trailing four quarters  the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8 7  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
Endeavors Undertaken
L Brands continues to revamp business by improving store experience  localizing assortments and enhancing direct business  These measures will facilitate it to generate incremental sales and increase store transactions through higher conversion rate  Further  the company s foray into international markets is likely to provide long term growth opportunities and generate increased sales volumes 
We believe that L Brands  sustained focus on cost containment  inventory management  merchandise  and speed to market initiatives has kept it afloat in a competitive environment  This is evident from its positive earnings surprise history  In the trailing eight quarters  it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8 4  
Comps Seem Back on Track
L Brands finally broke its streak of declining comparable sales  comps  in October  reporting 2  gain  As a result  management now expects third quarter earnings to be at the high end of its previously estimated guidance range of 25 30 cents  However  this is still down from the prior year quarter earnings of 42 cents  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has increased by a penny in the past 30 days  and is presently pegged at 30 cents 
Additionally  comps have declined 2   4   7   9   7   5   10   13  and 4  in September  August  July  June  May  April  March  February and January  respectively  Meanwhile  the company continues to face short term challenges due to its decision to exit the swimwear category that failed to generate desired results 
Will Earnings   Revenues Continue to Decline 
L Brands dwindling earnings and revenues remain the primary concern for investors  A look at the company s performance in fiscal 2017 unveils that net sales declined 7  and 5   while earnings per share fell 44  and 31  in the first and second quarter  respectively  Moreover  the second quarter marked the fourth straight quarter when the company s top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Per analysts surveyed by Zacks  third quarter earnings are likely to decline more than 28  year over year  However  revenues are anticipated to come in at  2 607 million  reflecting an increase of roughly 1  from the year ago quarter L Brands  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   What Does the Zacks Model Suggest 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that L Brands is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
L Brands carries a Zacks Rank  3 but an Earnings ESP of  0 47   Thus making surprise prediction difficult 
Stocks with Favorable Combination
Here are three companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
Burlington Stores  Inc    NYSE BURL   has an Earnings ESP of  1 27  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
The Home Depot  Inc    NYSE HD   has an Earnings ESP of  0 57  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT   has an Earnings ESP of  0 96  and a Zacks Rank  3

163136,384652,HD,The Top Retail Earnings Charts You Must See This Week ,opinion,"Third quarter earnings season is winding down  but this week there are still over 250 companies expected to report earnings  with many of them being the big retailers 
The retail sector has been one of the gloomiest groups on Wall Street  Many investors believe that they will ALL be Amazoned  But the department stores have already reported and it wasn t too bad  Will the others follow suit 
Tracey looked through the retail earnings charts to find those with the best track records this week  Some of these are trading near new highs  but some are not 
Keep an eye on comparable store sales guidance as well as the earnings miss or beat  It s just as important as beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
All 5 of these companies have had great comparable store sales results in the last few quarters  Can they do it again in a challenging retail environment 
5 Top Retail Earnings Charts
1     Home Depot   NYSE HD   is a beast  Not only has it beat every quarter for 5 years it is also crushing the comparables  In the second quarter  it did a 6 3  sales comp  Almost no one in the industry is doing it as well as Home Depot 
2     TJX Companies   NYSE TJX   is cashing in on the popular Home Goods chain  which did a 7  sales comparable last quarter  Consumers are willing to spend on their homes  But TJ Maxx s shares have been a bit weak  Will another good quarter boost the stock out of its narrow trading range 
3     Children s Place   NASDAQ PLCE   is a mall based retailer who hasn t missed in 5 years  This type of specialty retailer was supposed to be Amazoned  and its competitor  Gymboree  was  as it declared bankruptcy and closed 330 stores  But this gave a boost to Children s Place  It had a 3 1  comparable last quarter 
4     L Brands   NYSE LB   used to be the darling of the Street with its popular Pink brand but Pink isn t as popular as it once was and it has also exited swimwear  It pre announced sales comps of 2  and shares are off the lows 
5     Best Buy   NYSE BBY   was supposed to be Amazoned years ago but instead of caving in to the competition  it upped its game and came roaring back  Its last earnings miss was nearly 5 years ago and it did a 5 4  comp last quarter  among the best in the industry  Can it keep the momentum heading into the holiday season

163189,384705,HD,Ohio State attacker may have self radicalized  officials say,news,"By Mark Hosenball and Kim Palmer WASHINGTON COLUMBUS  Ohio  Reuters    A Somali immigrant who injured 11 people at Ohio State University in a vehicle and stabbing attack before he was shot dead may have followed the same path to self radicalization as militants in a number of  lone wolf  attacks  U S  officials said on Tuesday  Abdul Razak Ali Artan  20  was shot dead by a police officer on Monday moments after he plowed his car into a crowd of pedestrians and then leapt out and began stabbing people with a butcher knife  Investigators were probing the background of Artan  a Muslim who was a lawful permanent resident of the United States and a student at Ohio State  Authorities have given no direct motive for the attack on the Columbus campus  U S  Representative Adam Schiff  the ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence  said Artan appeared to have been influenced by material on the internet   It appears that the attacker was radicalized online by jihadist propaganda   he said in a statement  Schiff said no evidence has been uncovered showing that Artan communicated with or was directed by overseas militant groups  It was unclear what prompted Artan s family to immigrate to the United States or if his time outside the United States played a part in his decision to launch the attack  Schiff said  The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility on Tuesday for the attack  But a federal official who asked not to be identified said investigators have seen no evidence so far that the militant group s role was anything more than inspirational  Artan s actions fit the pattern of lone wolf militants who carried out other attacks  such as the gunman who shot to death 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando  Florida  in June  and the man who killed four U S  Marines and a Navy sailor in a shooting in Chattanooga  Tennessee  last year  the officials said  Those gunmen were also killed by police  ARTAN SPOKE OF  BOILING POINT  Investigators were looking into a message posted on Facebook  NASDAQ FB  by Artan with inflammatory statements about being  sick and tired  of seeing Muslims killed  a law enforcement source said    Stop the killing of the Muslims in Burma   Artan said in the Facebook post  Violence in Myanmar  which is also known as Burma  has sent Rohingya Muslims fleeing across the border to Bangladesh amid allegations of abuses by security forces  All of Artan s Facebook postings have been removed from the social media website  Artan s post did not mention Islamic State  but it praised Anwar al Awlaki  a U S  born radical cleric linked to al Qaeda who was killed by a U S  drone strike in 2011  Artan  who was born in Somalia  arrived in the United States in 2014  said a federal official  who asked not to be identified because of the ongoing investigation   Members of Columbus  Somali community have denounced the attack by Artan  Investigators believe Artan may have lived as long as seven years in Pakistan  said the federal official  Somali refugees often spend some time in Pakistan before coming to the United States   More recently  Artan worked at a  Home Depot   NYSE HD  store in Columbus  a U S  law enforcement official said  The attack rattled students at the state s flagship public university  One victim remained hospitalized on Tuesday at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center  Dr  Andrew Thomas  chief medical officer at the facility  said at a news conference  Two others were at Riverside Methodist Hospital  No victims have life threatening injuries   William Clark  a professor emeritus who was struck by Artan s car  told reporters after his release from the hospital that he would withhold judgment about Artan until he learns more about what motivated him  
 I m sore  but I m going home this afternoon and he s dead   Clark said   My sense is  out of respect for just the living and the dead  that we should wait until we know exactly what the truth is  ",2016-11-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/four-still-hospitalized-in-ohio-state-attack;-terror-link-probed-444335,444335
163202,384718,HD,Home Builders Buckle Under Tax Reform,opinion,"In   I ran out of time to comment on  from the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  regarding its failure to influence the Republican plan for tax reform  The tax plan coming out of the GOP side of the House of Representatives includes  to cut in half the cap on mortgages eligible for the interest rate deduction and also caps the deduction for state and local property taxes at  10 000  At the same time  the standard deduction is doubled so the number of people who will itemize should significantly drop  The NAHB has serious concerns about the potential negative impact on home ownership  and it delivered a clear warning that turned into a precursor of the steep sell off in housing related stocks  From NAHB Chairman Granger MacDonald on the GOP tax plan 

 This plan is particularly disappointing  given that the nation s home builders warned that the proposal would severely diminish the effectiveness of the mortgage interest deduction and presented alternative policies that would retain an effective housing tax incentive in the tax code 
By sharply reducing the number of taxpayers who would itemize  what s left is a tax bill that essentially eviscerates the mortgage interest deduction and strips the tax code of its most vital homeownership tax benefit  This tax blueprint will harm home values  act as a tax on existing home owners and force many younger  aspiring home buyers out of the market  

While the responses in the stock market varied roughly according to the concentration of high end and expensive housing for a given home builder  the net impact on iShares US Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB  and SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF  NYSE XHB   which includes Home Depot  NYSE HD  and Lowe s  NYSE LOW   was immediate and steep  ITB lost 2 4  and XHB lost 2 8   LOW dropped 4 1   and HD dropped 1 6  
I cannot explain why the two home improvement stores had such different impacts  I believe they have similar national coverage    but the selling is likely from the theory that home sales will drop as richer home owners will be more reluctant to move in the face of dramatically worse tax situations  current homeowners are grandfathered into the existing tax scheme  I provide select charts at the end of this post along with brief commentary 
While I complained in my last Housing Market Review that I was likely to miss the coming cycle of seasonal strength in home builders  I resisted the temptation to buy into the selling  Indeed  some of the charts below look like the beginnings of falling knives  I stopped out of my last position in a home builder as TRI Pointe Homes Inc  NYSE TPH  sold off most of the day  Luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL  was particularly tempting given a loss that was as high as 7  at one point  KeyBanc even stepped up as one of the first analysts to suggest buying into the sell off by recommending TOL  Yet  seeing TOL s CEO warn about the negative impact of this tax plan was the final stay for my hand  He specifically claimed that reducing the cap on the mortgage interest deduction would be very bad policy  and he toed the industry line 
There was at least ONE positive in all the chaos  Invitation Homes Inc  NYSE INVH  gained on the day  Presumably  fewer new home buyers means more renters and thus more business for companies like INVH which manages homes for rent 

Invitation Homes  INVH  came back to life with a 2 5  gain that looks like a fresh breakout 
Here are the rest of my select charts showing the carnage on the day 

The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  tumbled off its 10 year high for a 2 4  loss on the day 


Home Depot  HD  bounced neatly off its uptrending 50DMA 


Lowe s  LOW  experienced a bearish breakdown from converged 50 and 200DMA support 


Toll Brothers  TOL  ended a relentless uptrend through its upper Bollinger Band  BB  with a 6 1  loss 



California heavy Tri Pointe Group  TPH  plunged 4 4  but managed to stay within its upper Bollinger Band uptrend 
So much for considering buying California focused Five Point Holdings LLC  NYSE FPH  as a  cheap  housing play for the coming season  The severe reaction to the tax plan suggests I can afford to continue being patient 

Five Point Homes  FPH  took a while to get moving  When it did  the stock delivered a 4 4  loss on the day 
I do not regularly follow William Lyon Hms  NYSE WLH   but I have added it to my list based on the near parabolic reaction to earnings just three days ago 
Even with a 5 3  sell off  William Lyon Homes  WLH  managed to close on TOP of its upper Bollinger Band  BB  
MDC Holdings Inc  NYSE MDC  had the misfortune of reporting poorly received earnings on the same day as the announcement of the tax plan  The result was the most disastrous loss of the day  12 0  

M D C Holdings  MDC  broke down below its 50DMA support  If the 200DMA uptrend holds  MDC could become an attractive buy the dip play 


Meritage Corporation  NYSE MTH  suddenly looks very toppy with its 4 9  loss on the day 


LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH  lost 2 2  but stayed within its impressive uptrending channel 


Lennar  NYSE LEN   already licking its wounds from its announced deal for CalAtlantic  lost 3 3  to close at a new post earnings low 
While Lennar  LEN  lost a substantial amount on the day  diversification should ultimately lower the impact on business for the largest home builders  DR Horton Inc  NYSE DHI  looks like the winner on this score as the stock nearly escaped the day s sector selling unscathed  

D R  Horton  Inc   DHI  rallied off its low of the day to close near flat
PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM  bounced back as well but still ended the day with a 1 1  loss 

PulteHome  PHM  held onto its primary uptrend 
As long as the turmoil in the sector remains active  I am likely to increase the frequency of my postings on the housing market  Stay tuned and 
 Be careful out there

163209,384725,HD,U S  stock futures higher as attention returns to data and Fed,news,"Investing com   Wall Street futures pointed to a slightly higher open with the Dow on track for a seventh consecutive session of gains as most investors seemed to take a pause on recent market moves based on expectations for U S  President elect Donald Trump s future policies and turned their attention back to economic data and its implications for Federal Reserve  Fed  rate decisions 
The blue chip Dow futures inched up 13 points  or 0 07   by 6 56AM ET  11 56GMT   the S P 500 futures edged forward 4 point  or 0 17   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures gained 9 points  or 0 18  
Evidence of the pause in investor sentiment could be found in the dollar as it weakened against a basket of major currencies  Investors were locking in profits after a recent rally that drove the greenback to the strongest level since December 2015 spawned by speculation that future Trump policies would accelerate inflation and lead the Fed to tighten monetary policy 
Heightened inflation expectations had also been responsible for driving the 41 basis point jump in the yield on the U S  10 year Treasury in its steepest climb in more than seven years 
As investors in sovereign debt took a break on Tuesday  global bond prices were higher for the first time in almost a week  Bond prices move inversely to yields 
With Trump policy speculation apparently having run its course  investors will focus Tuesday on the next set of U S  data to see whether it supports expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates before the end of the year 
The most important piece of data Tuesday will be October retail sales at 8 30AM ET  13 30 GMT   The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0 6  last month  Core sales are forecast to inch up 0 5  
Besides the retail sales report  the U S  will also release data on import prices and the Empire State manufacturing survey at 8 30AM ET  13 30GMT   while business inventories are out at 10 00AM ET  15 00GMT  
There will also be a flurry of Fed speakers Tuesday  ahead of Fed chair Janet Yellen s congressional testimony Thursday 
Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren is due to speak at 8 00AM ET  13 00GMT   Fed governor Daniel Tarullo at 9 05AM ET  14 05GMT   Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer at 1 30PM ET and Dallas Fed president Rob Kaplan also at 1 30PM ET  18 30GMT  
On Monday  Kaplan indicated that it was far too early to interpret what the impact of Trump policies would be and said he was sticking to his previous outlook that it would appropriate to raise rates soon 
 I think you ll see us in the near future remove some accommodation   Kaplan said 
Aside from Kaplan  Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker said late Monday that more fiscal stimulus would bolster the case for raising rates  but it would be necessary to see how fiscal policies played out

163246,384762,HD,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Universal Forest  UFPI  Now,opinion,We issued an updated research report on Universal Forest Products Inc    NASDAQ UFPI   on Sep 19  A large customer base  impressive near term growth opportunities and synergistic benefits from acquisitions will prove advantageous for the company  However  headwinds related to international operations  rising costs and expenses as well as industry competition might restrict its growth momentum in the near term It currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Below we discuss why investors should hold Universal Forest s stock for now Growth DriversDiversification Benefits  We believe Universal Forest is poised to benefit from its vast customer base   including retailers  distributors  builders of single and multifamily homes  and others   in the retail building material  construction and industrial end markets  Also  international diversity has played a major role in building the company s profitability over time  It operates through its subsidiaries in North America  Europe  Asia and Australia  The company is working hard to strengthen its foothold internationally Inorganic Strategies and Shareholder Friendly Policies  Universal Forest remains keen on making meaningful acquisitions to expand its foothold in unexplored markets and enhance its product offerings  Notably  acquisition of certain assets of Quality Hardwood Sales  LLC and completion of Robbins Manufacturing Co  buyout in March 2017 are noteworthy  These two acquisitions are likely to fortify the company s position in the hardwood products market  improve its customer base and bolster sales  going ahead  Also  the company acquired Go Boy Pallets  LLC in May  This buyout has expanded its industrial packaging business Share buybacks and dividend payments are the prime means of returning value to shareholders for Universal Forest  In first half 2017  the company repurchased shares worth  9 9 million and paid dividend of  9 2 million Promising Near Term and Long Term Targets  We believe that initiatives to rebuild homes  offices and infrastructure damaged by Hurricane Harvey will spur growth for products offered by Universal Forest Products In the last month  shares of Universal Forest have yielded a return of 13 3   outperforming roughly 9 1  gain of the  Also  for 2017  the company expects an improvement in the top line  backed by the addition of new customers and products to its portfolio  Also  strengthening demand in the U S  construction market will support the company s top line growth Over the long term  the company aims to grow sales roughly 4 6  above GDP growth  New product sales are anticipated to constitute at least 10  of total sales while earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization growth will exceed unit sales growth  Also  the company anticipates offering high quality products to its customers  having started new development and testing facilities Headwinds Restricting Universal Forest s Growth ProspectsRising Costs  Universal Forest has been suffering from adverse impact of higher costs and expenses over time  In second quarter 2017  its bottom line was adversely impacted by 24 8  increase in costs of goods sold and 21 2  rise in operating expenses  Also  volatility in the lumber market was a concern  One of the major cost components of goods sold is cost of lumber products  We believe that unwarranted rise in cost of sales and operating expenses might dent the company s profitability going forward Diversification Woes  We believe Universal Forest s geographical expansion has exposed it to risks arising from foreign currency movements and geopolitical issues  Also  global uncertainties might hinder economic growth in developed and emerging nations  This  in turn  will adversely impact the housing markets and hence  demand for related products and services Stiff Competition   Others  Universal Forest is exposed to headwinds arising from stiff industry rivalry and customer concentration risks  For instance  the company derives a major portion of its sales from The Home Depot  NYSE HD   Any reduction in orders from this source may hurt its financial growth Stocks to ConsiderUniversal Forest currently has  1 8 billion market capitalization  We believe that the above mentioned positives and negatives clearly justify the stock s current Zacks Rank  3 Some better ranked stocks in the industry are Potlatch Corporation   NASDAQ PCH    Trex Company  Inc    NYSE TREX   and Rayonier Inc    NYSE RYN    While

Can Insurance Industry Survive the Storm 
With huge destruction in Texas and Florida  insured losses could be sky high  Property and casualty insurance companies may be hit hard as these are likely to shell out handsomely on claims in such catastrophic storms 
Florida was smashed in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew  a   slammed insurers with  15 billion and led to the failure of more than a dozen insurers  So  one can expect how heavy the impact on insurance companies would be this time around  iShares US Insurance ETF  will likely feel the brunt 
However  if rates rise in the coming days  insurance companies may get some cushion  Plus  the global reinsurance industry is oversupplied with capital  As of March  it had about a  605 billion capital  thanks to fewer enormous natural disasters in the United States since 2005  as per   see  here  
Already  shares of property and casualty homeowners insurance companies like Universal Insurance Holdings Inc    NYSE UVE   and HCI Group Inc    NYSE HCI   added about 8 9  and 2 7  on Sep 8  Reinsurers XL Group Ltd   NYSE XL   and Everest Re Group Ltd    NYSE RE   too added about 5 8  and 5   respectively  This means that most of the sell offs are overdone and priced in at the current level  Insurance companies  shares are recouping losses

Home Improvement Stocks to Buy Post Harvey MayhemHarvey  the first major hurricane to hit the U S  mainland in almost 12 years  has put vast areas under water  The onslaught of the torrential rainfall followed the storm  which originated in the Gulf of Mexico  While it is too early to gauge the financial impact of the hurricane  some experts are calling for losses in the double digit billions  Meanwhile  many are gearing up to rebuild homes  which drove demand for home improvement equipment  In fact  the tropical storm is set to dump more rain in areas such as Houston  TX  which propelled shares of home improvement retailers  This calls for investing in such stocks for solid gains Harvey Wreaks HavocHurricane Harvey claimed almost 10 lives and injured many more  Houston  the fourth largest city in the United States  has been flooded  The city received more than 30 inches of rain  as per National Weather Service  Starting Saturday  the city plunged into the torrential waters and the rain is not likely to subside before Aug 30 Numerous residents are trapped in the floods  while many fled to higher shelters  Many residents sought help on social media and even made efforts to save their pets  Dramatic rescue operations took place  with the Coast Guard saving dozens of lives Houston s health care infrastructure  in the meantime  took great efforts to heal the affected  In fact  many nursing home residents were stuck in waist high waters before they were rescued  Governor Greg Abbott of Texas said the region won t recover soon and called the storm  one of the largest disasters America has ever faced  Why It Was the Worst So FarThe rainstorm originated from a tropical depression which rapidly ballooned from a Category 1 hurricane to Category 4  It worsened due to a lethal confluence of meteorological events   Scientists say that warm water in the Gulf of Mexico intensified the downpour and lack of winds in the upper atmosphere that could have steered the hurricane away led to the intense damage Hal Needham  a storm surge expert and founder of the private firm Marine Weather   Climate in Galveston  TX  said that a  two  or three foot storm surge alone would not have been catastrophic   He added that  it was all these ingredients coming together  that made the hurricane so destructive  Dennis Feltgen  a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s National Hurricane Center in Miami added a note of caution and said that additional rains of 15 to 25 inches are expected to pour over parts of Southeast Texas  Some areas might even witness as much as 50 inches of rain Why Wasn t America Prepared As the storm isn t over yet  people are keen on finding out about failures in policy  planning and execution  Politicians are expected to come with the usual answer that Harvey was just too devastating and not much could have been done to minimize the losses But clearly  there are Meta problems that have turned this natural hazard into a full blown mega catastrophe  In such a case  looking into the condition of green space and wetlands could have reduced the impact of the storm  Proper runaway development plans and existence of large scale mitigation projects like seawalls and levees would have helped as well Home Improvement Companies Rally on Harvey Deluge  4 PicksNevertheless  Harvey continues to wreak havoc  while Houston s flood prone metropolitan area may have to bear several days of rainfall  adding to property damage  As home owners face damaged properties  likelihood of rebuilding efforts will

163312,384828,HD,Here s Why Lowe s  LOW  Stock Fell Today,opinion,"Shares of Lowe s   NYSE LOW   fell 6  in morning trading on Wednesday after the company reported worse than expected second quarter fiscal 2017 results 
Lowe s reported adjusted earnings of  1 57 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 62  The company also reported revenue of  19 495 billion  missing our estimate of  19 523 billion  although the company still grew 6 76  year over year   
Lowe s poor earnings contrast sharply with their rival The Home Depot  Inc    NYSE HD    Home Depot has been one of the  that had a great earnings report this fiscal quarter  The company beat our earnings estimates while its comparable store sales were up about 6 3  year over year  In comparison  Lowe s said their comparable sales rose only 4 5  
In order to improve sales  Lowe s plans to increase the number of hours their employees work in order to provide additional customer service face to face   We believe this is the right strategy to more fully capitalize on strong traffic trends in what we believe is a supportive macroeconomic backdrop for home improvement   said Robert Niblock  Lowe s CEO 
However  because workers will need to be paid more  the company s bottom line will take a hit  Lowe s has lowered its guidance for the full fiscal year to  4 20 to  4 30 a share  well below our estimate of  4 62 per share 
This strategy could pay off in the long run  though  Customer service remains a large incentive for customers to choose Lowe s over online retailers  like Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN    in order to get assistance on home improvements   This is one category in retail where service really matters   Brian Nagel  an analyst for Oppenheimer   Co   told CNBC this morning

163339,384855,HD,Why Is Home Depot Stock Slumping After Earnings Beat ,opinion,"Home Depot  NYSE HD  beat on EPS  Revenues  and Same Store Sales when it reported on Tuesday prior to the market open  However  after initially popping 2 5  to 158 11 from Monday s 154 26 close  HD reversed sharply into negative territory at 153 00 10 in pre market action and closed the day at 150 17  down 2 6  
I am not sure what the selling is all about  except for a  sell the news  reaction  but one look at my 4 hour chart of HD  we can see that HD actually peaked back in mid May  and since has established a series of lower highs  including Tuesday morning s spike to another lower high  
From a near term perspective  HD needed to hold support in the 152 40 60 area to avert triggering a potentially significant sell signal from one of a handful of powerful  still relevant and profitable  brick and mortar retailers 
Of course  that level didn t hold  and HD broke that along with its 20 day moving average  now at 150 47  in what increasingly appears to be a developing multi month top formation on Home Depot that is putting immense price pressure on critical support lodged between 146 30  the Nov 2016 to Aug 2017 support line  and the most recent meaningful pullback low at 144 25  July 24  2017  
Purely from a technical perspective  any forthcoming weakness must be contained above 144 25 to avert triggering downside potential that projects to 134 132  and possibly to 130 125 thereafter 
See our big picture comparison chart of the SPY  NYSE SPY  vs  HD  which illuminates the glaring price divergence between the two names  The glaring under performance of HD certainly is a drag on the underlying indices like SPY  but also could be a reflection of the health of the consumer  notwithstanding Tuesday morning s strong Retail Sales Report for July   or perhaps some fatigue in the home improvement sector 
All I know is that the pictures of HD and its post EPS price action are a warning signal about something either macro in scope or indigenous to the company s future growth prospects ",2017-08-16,Mike Paulenoff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-home-depot-stock-slumping-after-earnings-beat-200207468,200207468

163341,384857,HD,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Nutrisystem  Malibu Boats  SodaStream International  Royal Caribbean Cruises And Bright Horizons Family Solutions,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 17  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Nutrisystem  Inc   NASDAQ   NASDAQ NTRI       Malibu Boats  Inc   NASDAQ   NASDAQ MBUU       SodaStream International Ltd   NASDAQ   NASDAQ SODA       Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd   NYSE   NYSE RCL      and Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc   NYSE   NYSE BFAM       Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Ignore Retail  5 Stocks Gaining from a Bolder ConsumerThe largest increase in retail sales in seven months failed to lift consumer sentiment substantially on Tuesday  Moreover  a selloff in traditional retail stocks followed  raising concerns over the sector s long term prospects  Industry watchers may hold differing views on this issue  but it is becoming increasingly difficult to profit from the country s rising purchasing power using traditional retail stocks At the same time  it is difficult to ignore that a resilient labor market  accompanied by a slow and steady rise in wages  has made U S  consumers increasingly confident  Traditional retail stocks may have lost their luster  but there are still several other avenues to profit from rising discretionary spending  Investing in consumer discretionary stocks from domains other than retail makes for a smart move at this point  Amazonification  EffectThe lion s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event  Amazon Prime Day  The annual event  during which consumers flock to Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  for the year s best shopping deals  contributed to gains for every product category  The Department of Commerce s report reflects this as a 1 3  monthly increase in what is categorized as non store retail spending But for the sudden spurt in auto sales  other notable movements in the consumer spending report also have crucial linkages with Amazon  For instance  the decline in sales at electronics stores is likely a result of most consumers opting to buy this category of products from online alternatives  possibly Amazon Home Depot  NYSE HD  Leads Retail SlideWhile Amazon did end the day around 0 1  lower  investor attention was largely fixed on the fall in traditional retail stocks  Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that companies are not immune to  Amazonification   But Home Depot s move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker Our ChoicesConsumer s growing tendency to switch from offline to online alternatives has been apparent even in the recent past  But this is possible the first spurt in retail trade which is being partially attributed to sales derived only from Amazon com  Clearly  the days of retail are increasingly numbered However  this doesn t mean that you should ignore the higher discretionary spending power of the American consumer  Several profitable alternatives from domains other than retail continue to exist  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score Nutrisystem  Inc   NASDAQ      is a leading provider of weight management products and services Nutrisystem has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a VGM Score of A  The

growth of 33 6  for the current year  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 6 6  over the last 30 days  The stock has a Zacks Rank  1  You can see Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd

Launched in 1893  Sears  beginnings were humble  The company began as a catalog for watches and jewelry under the name Sears  Roebuck    Co   but quickly grew into a retail empire that became consumers  go to store 
Its retail locations  constructed in the 1920s  began outselling its famous catalog by 1931  and Sears exploded  growing and expanding into numerous markets 
From constructing the famous Sears Tower  now the Willis Tower  in Chicago to buying a securities and real estate firms in the 1980s  Sears began to stray from its core retail business  allowing its top competitors like Macy s   NYSE M    Walmart   NYSE WMT    and Home Depot   NYSE HD   to invade to invade its market 
But Sears kept on going  creating a popular online store and merging with Kmart in 2005  During this time  though  Walmart had dethroned Sears to become the biggest retailer in the company  while Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   was just beginning to branch out from selling books  and we know now Amazon s true retail goal  
Sears was losing ground  and losing ground fast  Hit hard by the financial crisis something the company was never able to recover from Sears then split itself into several different business units  a decision that caused internal tension  anger  and bitterness 
It s easy to say that Walmart and Amazon killed Sears  but the retailer itself did a nice job of contributed to its own slow demise  And when you look at its history  a not so shocking one

Investor expectations grew that the European Central Bank is moving closer to cutting down its bond buying program  after Draghi said the central bank saw signs of  unquestionable improvement  in the euro zone growth and gave signs that policymakers would discuss changes to the bank s monetary policy in September 
The euro reached near two year highs at  1 1658 against the dollar  following Draghi s comments and remained on track to post gains for a fifth consecutive month 
The single currency also made significant gains against sterling  with EUR GBP rising to a seventh month high of  0 8961

GBP USD
Sterling  fell to  1 2931 against the dollar  giving back some of its recent gains  despite UK retail sales data exceeding expectations 
Retail sales rose by 1 5  in the three months to the end of June  recovering from the 1 4  drop in sales sustained over the first three months of the year 
The UK currency also reached seven month lows against the euro after ECB President Mario Draghi said the bank s Governing Council put off any discussion of the options for a possible shift in monetary policy until the fall 
The focus for today is shifted towards the UK report on public sector net borrowing

163444,384960,HD,Senate approves major cybersecurity bill,news,"By Dustin Volz WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Senate easily passed legislation on Tuesday aimed at bolstering the country s cyber defenses  advancing the first serious attempt in Congress to combat computer hacks that have hit a growing number of businesses and government agencies in recent years  The bill  which would expand liability protections to companies that choose to voluntarily share cyber threat data with the government  must be reconciled with two similar information sharing measures that passed the House of Representatives earlier this year  It cleared the Senate by a vote of 74 21 with strong bipartisan support  The White House announced support last week for the Senate bill  although it stated a desire for some revisions before it lands on President Barack Obama s desk  The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act  or CISA  is a proposal that languished in the Senate for several years partly because of privacy groups  concerns it would shuttle more personal information into the hands of the National Security Agency and other government spies  But business interests  including the Chamber of Commerce  have argued an information sharing law is necessary to allow the private sector to cooperate more closely with the government on detecting and minimizing cyber threats without fear of lawsuits  A round of amendments intended to strengthen some of the bill s privacy protections failed on Tuesday as the bill s bipartisan sponsors warned last minute changes could upset the balanced language that was the culmination of years of negotiations  Skeptics of CISA have said it would do little to prevent malicious breaches like the kind that crippled Sony Pictures last year  which the Obama administration publicly blamed on North Korea  or recent thefts of data from companies like Target   Home Depot   N HD  or Anthem Insurance   Even some of the bill s supporters have conceded the bill is a small first step to shore up U S  cyber defenses  which are constantly under assault by hacking groups and foreign nation states like China and Russia  according to government officials  Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday that CISA was  far too weak   The bill s passage through the Senate was a defeat for digital privacy activists who celebrated the passage in June of a law effectively ending the NSA s bulk collection of U S  call metadata  
The curtailment of that program  which had been exposed in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden  represented the first significant restriction of the U S  government s intelligence gathering capabilities since the Sept  11  2001  attacks ",2015-10-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/senate-approves-major-cybersecurity-bill-368330,368330

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

Buck the Retail Slump with These 5 Solid Picks

	Last month  U S  retail sales suffered their largest decline since Jan 2016  A report from the U S  Census Bureau shows that the drop was primarily attributable to a concurrent fall in gasoline prices  Additionally  a relatively smaller number of cars and trucks were purchased last month 

	However  retail sales registered a moderate level of year over year growth  This suggests that the sector s fortunes are in keeping with that of the wider economy  Though May s decline was reflected across most categories  some still fared relatively  better remaining unchanged or even posting small increases  Investing in stocks from these areas can make for a prudent option at this time 

Largest Decline in 16 Months

	In May  retail sales declined by 0 3   belying expectations of a small  but significant 0 1  increase  The figure also compares poorly with the unrevised 0 4  increase reported in April  An unusually late Easter holiday and the payout of tax refunds had ensured that sales in April experienced an improvement 

	In contrast  sales weakened in May  primarily due to the 2 4  decline in sales at gasoline stations  This is  of course  a major positive for consumers since it increases their purchasing power substantially going forward  Meanwhile  sales at auto and other motor vehicles dealers also declined  by 0 2   last month  This fall also had a major impact on the composite reading since they account for nearly 20  of all retail sales 

	Declines were also witnessed across most other categories  but this may have had only a limited impact  Sales at electronics and appliance stores declined by 2 8   marking the sharpest fall since Mar 2010  Additionally  food services and drinking places sales experienced a 0 1  decline while sporting goods  hobby  book and music stores witnessed their receipts falling by 0 6   The steady rise of online retail led to sales at department stores falling by 1  

Moderate Growth Trend Intact

	Looking past the gloom  a year over year increase of 3 8  proves that a moderate growth trend for the retail sector remains firmly in place  Moreover  sales for the first five months of 2017 have registered an increase of 3 9  compared to the same period last year  A strong jobs market  soft interest rate regime and increasing home sales will continue to push consumer expenditure higher  The CPI declined by 0 1  in May to underline the fact that levels of inflation continue to remain low 

	More importantly  not every category experienced a downturn last month  Sales for building material  garden equipment and supplies remained flat while registering a year over year increase of 10 8   This development was sufficient to boost Home Depot  NYSE HD  by 1 8  on Wednesday  which in turn helped the Dow end with gains 

	Among the notable gainers for May were clothing and clothing accessories stores which experienced monthly and yearly increases of 0 3  and 1   respectively  Furniture and home furnishing stores experienced a 0 4  increase in May and posted a 4 4  year over year increase  But the largest gainer for the month was non store retailers  This category added 0 8  to sales and clocked up a 10 2  yearly increase  clearly benefiting from the furious pace of growth in the online sales space 

Our Choices

	Despite the slowdown experienced in May  retail sales continue to be supported by the factors which have fueled gains for most of the year  The job market remains in good health and inflation remains low  Though the slump in receipts at gasoline stations impacted the overall figure last month  lower fuel prices have also boosted consumers  purchasing power 

	Picking stocks from retail categories which registered gains even during a difficult month makes for a smart choice at this point  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics 

PetMed Express  Inc    NASDAQ         is a leading nationwide pet pharmacy  PetMed Express  product line contains approximately 750 SKUs catering to dogs  cats and horses

163462,384978,HD,Calavo Growers  Andersons  AptarGroup  UFP Technologies And Mobile Mini Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 30  2017   Calavo Growers  Inc   NASDAQ        as the Bull of the Day  Andersons  Inc   NASDAQ        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AptarGroup  Inc   NYSE         UFP Technologies  Inc   NASDAQ        and Mobile Mini  Inc   NASDAQ        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

Calavo Growers  Inc    NASDAQ       is cashing in on record avocado and fresh food demand  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  just reported a record second quarter across all of its segments 
	Calavo Growers is a Santa Paula  California avocado and fresh produce grower of a variety of products including tomatoes and tropical produce  Its food business makes and manufactures guacamole  guacamole hummus and salsa under the Calavo brand name 

	Its Renaissance Food Group also makes lifestyle products through fast growing brands such as Garden Highway and Chef Essentials A Big Beat in the Fiscal Second Quarter of 2017
	On June 6  Calavo reported its fiscal second quarter results and easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15   The company earned  0 74 versus the Zacks Consensus of  0 64 
	It was a record second quarter with virtually all key metrics reaching new all time  single period highs 
	Revenue rose 23  to  270 2 million while gross margin jumped 35  to a record  36 3 million  or 13 4  of total revenue  That was up from 12 2  of total revenue in the year ago quarter 
	Each of its segments saw double digit growth 
	In the Fresh segment  which includes avocados  revenue jumped due to focus and execution of the Calavo team combined with record consumer demand which is exceeding available industry supply 
	The avocado crop  industry wide  has been smaller this year than last year  Calavo  for instance  packed just 4 8 million total units in the quarter compared to 6 4 million total units in the year ago quarter due to the smaller avocado crop 

	But that supply demand imbalance has also meant higher avocado prices which is why revenue remained so robust 
	In the Renaissance Food Group segment  revenue rose by 24  due to the addition of new retail customers  added divisions of existing customers  penetration into newer geographic markets and the broadening of product capabilities 
	It continues to expand its plants and add capacity which impacted gross margin in this segment in the quarter The Future s Bright
	Avocado toast has been all the rage for the past year and while this food item gets mocked  it represents the growing demand for avocado in a host of foods and settings 
	Avocado isn t just limited to guacamole in the local Mexican restaurant anymore 
	Globally  more consumers are eating avocado than ever before which is also putting pressure on prices 
	Calavo re affirmed its full year outlook  stating that it was on track to achieve double digit growth in revenue and gross margin dollars  It still expects to post record earnings per share for the fiscal year 
	The analysts are bullish too  One estimate has been raised for the full fiscal year in the last week which has pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate up to  2 53 from  2 46  That is earnings growth of 16   Calavo made just  2 18 last year 
	Fiscal 2018 is also looking good with another 15 4  earnings growth Shares Leap to 3 Year High
	The shares have been on quite a tear with all the good news this year 

	They ran up to 3 year highs before giving back a little bit of the recent gains 

	They re not cheap  Calavo trades with a forward P E of 27 but you re buying the growth  not the value 
	As an added bonus  Calavo does reward shareholders with a dividend  It s currently yielding 1 3  
	For investors looking for a way to play the hot avocado and fresh food trend  Calavo should be on your short list Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies 
	It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively 
	And this out performance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation 

  

The Andersons  Inc   NASDAQ       is struggling to find the right mix in the agribusiness sector  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  has closed its retail stores as part of its turnaround strategy 
	The Andersons was founded in 1947 by Harold Anderson in Maumee  Ohio with a single grain elevator  It has grown into an agribusiness company with numerous business segments across North America  including in grain  ethanol  plant nutrient and rail End of an Era as Andersons General Stores Close
	On June 3  The Andersons closed its 4 remaining Andersons General Stores  which were located in Columbus and Toledo  Ohio 
	It was a bittersweet moment for many in Ohio as the first store opened in 1952 and employed 1050  although 75  of those were part time workers 
	The retail stores were a legacy of the original founder but the stores could not compete with Home Depot  NYSE HD   Lowe s  Tractor Supply and others in the same space as retail became more competitive 
	The retail segment had lost  20 million over the past 8 years  It never recovered from the Great Recession as it hadn t made annual profit since 2008 
	But this means it can focus on areas it does well  including its grain and rails businesses Met the Estimate in the First Quarter
	On May 3  The Andersons reported first quarter results and met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 07 
	Three of its 4 business segments saw better year over year results 
	In addition to getting rid of its retail operations  it sold some underperforming Nutrient Group assets in Florida in the quarter 
	In good news  it acquired a small specialty grain handling and milling business that will boost its food ingredient capabilities 
	The Plant Nutrient and Rail segments had weak quarters but it looks like market conditions might be bottoming 
	In nutrients  low prices due to oversupply are expected to persist but should start to improve in 2018  Demand remains strong 
	In the rails  North American rail traffic improved year over year but volumes remained historically low  However  the company believes that the rails are in the later stages of a cyclical market downturn Estimates Cut
	The analysts are still pessimistic on the changes being made  at least for 2017 
	The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate fell to  1 75 from  2 22 just 90 days ago  However  2018 looks a little better with the consensus at  2 35 Shares Fall From 1 Year Highs
	Shares of The Andersons have fallen since the company announced in early January 2017 that it was closing its retail operations 

	However  they re still not that cheap  It trades with a forward P E of 19 7 
	Shareholders do get a dividend  currently yielding 1 9  for their patience 
	If you re looking for an agribusiness company with a better Rank  you might want to consider Syngenta  It s a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies 
	It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

These 5 Retailers Crushed Q1 Earnings  What s Going On  

	Between yesterday after the bell and this morning before market open  there were a slew of retailers that reported their first quarter results  And surprisingly  the results were strong  with some posting better earnings and comparable store sales numbers than expected 

	Let s take a look at five retailers making Wall Street very happy today 

Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE        

	Abercrombie   Fitch reported a loss of 72 cents per share  this number excludes 19 cents from non recurring items  that matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenues declined 4  year over year to  661 1 million  but beat our consensus estimate of  653 million  total comparable store sales were down 3   Abercrombie s flagship net sales decreased 11  to  286 4 million  but sales at the Hollister brand increased 3  to  374 7 million 

	The company is currently on the market to sell itself  Yesterday  the Wall Street Journal  that American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO   together with private equity firm Cerberus Capital  are teaming up to buy the struggling company  This has yet to be confirmed  however 

	Thanks to this decent but not terrible report  shares of ANF are up about almost 9  in mid morning trading 

Best Buy  NYSE        

	Best Buy  a popular electronics retailer  posted adjusted earnings of 60 cents per share  comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents per share and increasing 40  year over year  Revenues came in at  8 528 billion  also topping our consensus estimate and growing 1  from the prior year quarter 

	Total comparable store sales were up 1 6  thanks to growth in both domestic and international sales  as well as robust performance in gaming and mobile  Best Buy said that digital sales increased over 22  in Q1  a sign that the company is continuing to improve its e commerce business and grow its audience online 

	Shares of BBY were up over 17  in mid morning trading  For Zacks  analysis on Best Buy s earnings report    

Guess  Inc   NYSE         

	Even though mall staple Guess  reported a loss per share of 24 cents  it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 31 cents  as well as management s guided loss in the range of 33 30 cents  Net revenues came in at  458 6 million  also outpacing the Zacks estimate and improving 2 2  year over year  This upside was due to strong sales in Guess  Europe  Asia  and Wholesale segments 

	Overseas segments did very well for Guess in Q1  Breaking them down  Europe revenues were up 23 3   29 1  on a constant currency basis  to  165 4 million  while Asia increased 16 9   up 15 5  on a constant currency basis  to  63 4 million 

	GES stock has gained about 15 5  so far today   for Zacks  analysis on Guess  Q1 earnings 

Sears 

	For the first time in nearly two years  struggling department store Sears reported its first quarterly profit thanks to the sale of its Craftsman tool business  Net income attributable to shareholders was  244 million  or  2 28 per share  compared with a loss of  471 million  or  4 41 per share in the year ago quarter  Excluding adjustments  Sears reported a net loss of  2 15 per share 

	Revenues came in at  4 3 billion  decreasing 20 3  year over year mostly due to lower demand for groceries  household items  pharmacy  and apparel at Kmart  as well as fewer sales of home appliances at Sears  Sales at U S  stores open more than a year declined by 12 4   while sales at Kmart fell by 11 2  in Q1 

	Sears also announced that it s boosting its cost cutting efforts to  1 25 billion  up from a prior target of  1 billion  and plans to review its store fleet 

	SHLD stock is soaring today  up about 25  in mid morning trading 

Williams Sonoma  NYSE        

	Home and kitchen retailer Williams Sonoma reported an earnings beat of 51 cents per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents  Net revenues of  1 112 billion came in slightly above the Zacks estimate and increased 1 2  year over year thanks to strong growth at West Elm and Williams Sonoma brands  in addition to international and newer businesses like Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham 

	Total comparable brand revenues increased just 0 1  in the quarter  significantly lower than the 4 5  increase reported in the previous quarter  Comparable brand revenues for all the brands declined  except West Elm and William Sonoma  These businesses saw increases of 6  and 3 2   respectively  E commerce revenues were  581 million  up 0 7  year over year 

	Shares of WSM rallied over 9  immediately after the retailer s report was released after the bell yesterday  though the stock is now down about 0 26  today in mid morning trading   for Zacks  analysis on Williams Sonoma s Q1 earnings 

Bottom Line

	Even though these recent earnings reports may seem like the retail industry has potentially found its footing again  that notion is pretty unlikely  Realistically  it s a lot of retailers reporting results that were not as bad as anticipated  and investor relief is strikingly apparent 

	But while many companies like Macy s disappointed this season  there were some retailers  like Best Buy  that made concentrated efforts to turn their businesses around  with some brands  instead of closing old locations  And  bright spots like Home Depot  NYSE HD  and Walmart  NYSE WMT  are showing investors that there is still hope against a giant like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  

Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside 

	Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana 

	Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look  

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

	Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015  Its average gain has been a stellar  26  per year

The British pound rose modestly versus the greenback  while bond yields in the region were narrowly mixed 
Stocks in Asia finished higher with markets in Japan and India gaining ground on optimism about earnings growth and yesterday s rally in oil prices after Russia and Saudi Arabia said they would back a longer than expected production cut extension  Markets shrugged off global political and trade uncertainty  as well as the recent string of softer than expected Chinese economic data and flared up geopolitical concerns toward North Korea 
Japanese equities rose  though gains were pared as the yen showed some late day strength  while markets in India also advanced  Stocks in mainland China increased  as lingering concerns about regulatory crackdowns and economic activity were overshadowed by reports that the government was intervening to stabilize the markets  per Bloomberg  but those traded in Hong Kong dipped slightly  Finally  Australian securities rose  with commodity related issues advancing to more than offset some sluggishness in the financial sector  while listings in South Korea were also higher

163551,385067,HD,After Solid Earnings  Here Are 5 Fun Facts About Home Depot,opinion,"Home Depot   NYSE HD   reported strong first quarter earnings on Tuesday  with sales up 4 9  year over year to  23 9 billion  The home improvement giant posted net earnings of  2 billion and reaffirmed its fiscal 2017 guidance  which calls for sales growth of 4 6  
While many other big retail chains have struggled over the past few years as e commerce sites push further and further into the market  Home Depot has remained resilient  In fact  the company has been on a meteoric rise throughout the decade and in the last seven years in particular  On Aug  1  2010 the company s stock was trading at  27 per share  Today  shares of Home Depot hover at nearly  160 
One of the biggest reasons for the massive growth is the home improvement company s continued focus and commitment to its do it yourself model 
With all of this in mind  let s take a look at 5 facts you might not know about Home Depot and its history 
1  Its  Founders Were Laid Off From a Hardware Store Before Starting the Company  
Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank founded Home Depot in 1978 in Atlanta  Georgia after the two were fired from a local hardware store  The company opened its first two locations on June 22  1979  At the time  the big box store s 60 000 square foot spaces were too big for the company s actual inventory  so Marcus and Blank packed the stores  upper shelves with empty boxes and even purposely nicked up the floors and shelves to give their new company a warehouse appeal  Home Depot began trading on the NYSE on April 19  1984 
2  Current Retail Success 
Today  Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer in the world  operating more than 2 200 stores in the U S   Puerto Rico  U S  Virgin Islands  Guam  10 Canadian provinces  and Mexico  In 2004  Home Depot bought Home Mart Mexico  which helped it almost double its locations south of the border 
The company s current market cap rests at  190 71 billion  far above rival Lowe s   NYSE LOW   at  73 55 billion 
3  Failed Expansions 
In the mid 2000s  Home Depot tried to expand its business in multiple ways  First  the company announced in 2005 its plans to open convenience stores located in the parking lots of its big box locations in order to attract more customers  The original plan was to open 300 Home Depot Fuel convenience stores by 2010  Home Depot opened a few locations in Tennessee and Georgia  but the original plan for mass expansion never materialized and the company moved on relatively quickly from the convenience store push to focus on its core business 
In December 2006  Home Depot announced it had purchased Chinese home improvement retailer The Home Way  The move provided the company 12 stores in six cities  right off the bat  But the move into China didn t last long  and by 2012 the company had closed nearly all of its Chinese locations  conceding that it misread the market s appetite for its DIY mantra 
4  Strong Connection to Sports  
From 1992 to 2009  Home Depot employed hundreds of Olympic athletes and hopefuls  The idea was simple  give athletes a steady paycheck and flexible hours while they work towards their expensive and time consuming Olympic dreams  Home Depot was also a long time sponsor one of NASCAR s most popular drivers  Tony Stewart 
Home Depot s co founder Arthur Blank has owned the NFL s Atlanta Falcons since 2002 after he stepped away from a more formal role at the company  Blank recently purchased one of Major League Soccer s newest franchises  Atlanta United FC  which made its league debut in 2017 
The home improvement company will soon debut its new Home Depot Backyard park and tailgate center  According to the company s website  the space will  feature unique arts  entertainment and cultural experiences that will bring together local residents  located directly next to Atlanta s Mercedes Benz Stadium United FC and the Falcons  brand new state of the art home 
5  Commitment to Sustainability    
According to Home Depot itself  the company got a huge environmental wake up call in 1998 when protesters converged on the company s Atlanta support center with signs reading   stop selling old growth wood   The complaints were levied at Home Depot for its use of lumber from environmentally fragile forests Since then  the company has strived to become a better environmental actor  By 2007  Home Depot had pushed to label a decent amount of its products to note what goods were manufactured with energy conservation  sustainable forestry  and clean water practices in mind  In a four year span from 2010 to 2014  Home Depot reduced its in stores energy use by 30  
Today the company sources less than 0 15  of wood from the Brazilian Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   It now gets 94  of its lumber from North America  Home Depot earned the U S  Environmental Protection Agency s  ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award  in 2013  2014  and 2015  The company also recently won the EPA s  WaterSense Partner  and  SmartWay Excellence  awards for its sustainable practices 
Home Depot sold more Forest Stewardship Council certified wood than any other North American company in 2014 
The company sold 161 million ENERGY STAR certified products in 2016 amounting to over  903 million in energy savings  also reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 4 9 million metric tons  The  WaterSense  products the company sells helped saved almost 76 billion gallons of water in 2016 
As you can see  sustainability is just one of the many defining characteristics of Home Depot a brand that has etched its name into the fabric of American retail history

163552,385068,HD,Opening Bell  SPX  NASDAQ Close At Record Highs  Oil Up  USD Falls,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
Yesterday s equity rally which took the S P 500 and NASDAQ to new record high closes for each is showing signs of fading  even as oil continues to extend its gains  While Japanese stocks opened with a rising gap  there was not enough demand to support the up trend  they fell back toward yesterday s closing prices  However  after a lull they once again pushed through and as of this writing are continuing the rally 

Currently  Asian  US and UK markets continue to rally as EU markets sit this one out 

Crude oil crossed over  49 as well as its 200dma yesterday and reached the better part of  50 a barrel  However  despite the sudden global enthusiasm for the volatile commodity on the prospects of extended production cuts led by Saudi Arabia and Russia  oil pared some of its gains to close below  49  and the 200dma 
Today  crude extended gains  advancing for the fifth straight day on the hope that other oil producers might join in the extended cuts  Oil is back above  49  but as of 3 00 EDT  still beneath the 200dma  A weakening dollar should boost both oil and equities 

The Dollar Index is free falling for a fourth consecutive day  heading toward its May low  its lowest point since November  Concurrently  gold is rising for a fourth straight day 
Today s downward driver for the USD is the news that President Donald Trump shared classified information with the Russians  This political scandal comes on top of Trump s firing of FBI director Comey late last week  All of which is putting into question his ability to deliver on his economic agenda 

In response to the dollar s decline  the euro leaped  breaking through its trading pattern since April 24 and blowing out what may have proved to be a H S reversal 

The Mexican peso aka the anti Trump trade is gaining  moving higher for its sixth straight day 
The yen pared yesterday s losses but remains beneath the broken uptrend line and the 50dma  It s poised for another decline 
On May 7  South Korea s KOSPI recorded a new record high  This was also the final trading day prior to the country s presidential elections on May 9  After liberal candidate Moon Jae in won  the KOSPI pared half its gains 
Possibly  this occurred because Moon  the first liberal voted into office in a decade  prefers to improve relations with North Korea over the existing relationship with the US  On the other hand  he was open about this throughout the campaign and nevertheless had a 20 percent lead over his opponents  The sell off may therefore have been a knee jerk reaction by traders about the uncertainty in light of North Korea s recent missile testing  Nevertheless  yesterday the KOSPI closed at the pre sell off level 
At the same time  the South Korean won plunged over 0 35  percent with a breakaway gap from the trading pattern it s been in since April  extending its decline to  66  of a percent  A weakening won should boost South Korean equities 
Global exchanges made records this week  once more finding their animal spirits despite Trump  most likely receiving a lift from China s massive plan to boost global infrastructure spending  The surge in oil helped ignite further the animal spirits  despite recent concerns regarding the strength of the global economy  after Chinese industrial production and retail data disappointed on Monday  on the heels of US retail sales and inflation which came in weaker  as well 
Here s what investors will be keeping an eye on today 

Gross domestic product figures for the eurozone came in at 1 3   while the prior read was 3 0 
U K  inflation data  grew almost across the board 
Germany s ZEW confidence gauge surprised to the downside 
U S  Housing Starts  8 30  growth is expected to have risen 3 7  after the previous drop of 6 8   but the most important U S  data point will be industrial production  which will provide useful insight into how the manufacturing sector is performing  particularly now that auto sales appear to have peaked for the cycle  Output is expected to have declined from 0 5  to 0 4  growth 
The IEA comes out with estimates of April OPEC production  As opposed to Goldman Sachs  the IEA says extending production cuts isn t likely to reduce global oil inventories

163581,385097,HD,U S  targets overseas cyber attackers with sanctions program,news,"By Jeff Mason and Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Barack Obama launched a sanctions program on Wednesday to target individuals and groups outside the United States that use cyber attacks to threaten U S  foreign policy  national security or economic stability   In an executive order  Obama declared such activities a  national emergency  and allowed the U S  Treasury Department to freeze assets and bar other financial transactions of entities engaged in destructive cyber attacks  The executive order gave the administration the same sanctions tools it deploys to address other threats  including crises in the Middle East and Russia s aggression in Ukraine  Those tools are now available for a growing epidemic of cyber threats aimed at U S  computer networks   The Obama administration is really getting serious now  This order brings to bear the economic might of the United States against people who are robbing us blind and putting us in danger   said Joel Brenner  who headed U S  counterintelligence during President George W  Bush s second term   The effort to toughen the response to hacking follows indictments of five Chinese military officers and the decision to  name and shame  North Korea for a high profile attack on Sony  Officials said they hoped U S  allies would follow suit  China  which routinely denies accusations by U S  investigators that hackers backed by the Chinese government have been behind attacks on U S  companies  said cyber attacks were generally cross border incidents with origins hard to track   China consistently does not approve of any one country using its domestic law to implement sanctions at every turn against the people or entities in another country   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing  Senior U S  administration officials said the new program was focused on activities rather than countries or regions   U S  lawmakers and security and legal experts welcomed the move as an encouraging step after a steady stream of cyber attacks aimed at Target   Home Depot   NYSE HD  and other retailers  as well as military networks  But they said the executive order was surprisingly broad  which could result in a compliance nightmare for companies  and warned that it remained difficult to definitively  attribute  hacking attacks and identify those responsible  Obama said in a statement that harming critical infrastructure  misappropriating funds  using trade secrets for competitive advantage and disrupting computer networks would trigger the penalties  Companies that knowingly use stolen trade secrets to undermine the U S  economy would also be targeted   From now on  we have the power to freeze their assets  make it harder for them to do business with U S  companies  and limit their ability to profit from their misdeeds   Obama said  The program was designed as a deterrent and punishment  filling a gap in U S  cybersecurity efforts where diplomatic or law enforcement means were insufficient  Michael Daniel  Obama s cybersecurity adviser  told reporters  He said there was no timeline for determining an initial round of targets  BIG BANG Under the program  cyber attackers or those who conduct commercial espionage in cyberspace can be listed on the official sanctions list of specially designated nationals  a deterrent long sought by the cyber community   This sends a signal that the days of free range hacking are over   said James Lewis  a cyber expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies  But Lewis said it would take time for the system of penalties to take hold   People keep looking for a  Big Bang  moment  but this will take years   he said  John Reed Stark  a former head of Internet enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission  expressed skepticism  citing the high number of state sponsored cyber attacks and the difficulty of identifying hackers  Mark Rasch  a former Justice Department trial attorney and former executive with defense contractor SAIC  said the breadth of the order gave the executive branch vast new powers to respond to even routine criminal hacking  Even denial of service attacks that knock websites offline with meaningless traffic  which can be orchestrated over the Internet for a few hundred dollars  could officially qualify for sanctions  he said  If used widely  he said  the order could spell  a compliance nightmare for companies   Representative Michael McCaul  chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee  said many questions remained about the administration s overall strategy  and what underlying definitions would be used to govern implementation of sanctions  Dmitri Alperovitch  chief technology officer of Crowdstrike  a cybersecurity firm  said the order could have a  momentous  effect by preventing cyber criminals from spending the proceeds of their attacks  and closing off companies based in China and elsewhere from the U S  financial market   If ABC Corp has had intellectual property stolen and then it s showing up in products of So and So Co of Shenzhen  you can tell them that it s been misappropriated and that their property in the U S  is now subject to seizure   Brenner said

163644,385160,HD,Costly shift to new credit cards won t fix security issues,news,"By Nandita Bose CHICAGO  Reuters    New technology about to be deployed by credit card companies will require U S  consumers to carry a new kind of card and retailers across the nation to upgrade payment terminals  But despite a price tag of  8 65 billion  the shift will address only a narrow range of security issues  Credit card companies have set an October deadline for the switch to chip enabled cards  which come with embedded computer chips that make them far more difficult to clone  Counterfeit cards  however  account for only about 37 percent of credit card fraud  and the new technology will be nearly as vulnerable to other kinds of hacking and cyber attacks as current swipe card systems  security experts say  Moreover  U S  banks and card companies will not issue personal identification numbers  PINs  with the new credit cards  an additional security measure that would render stolen or lost cards virtually useless when making in person purchases at a retail outlet  Instead  they will stick with the present system of requiring signatures  Anre Williams  president of global merchants services at American Express  cited cost and complexity as reasons for not issuing PIN numbers  which would require a much larger investment by card issuers   It is the PIN management system that takes the effort   Williams said  in part because of the additional customer support it requires  Chip technology has been widely used in Europe for nearly two decades  but banks there typically require PINs  Even so  the technology leaves data unprotected at three key points  security experts say  When it enters a payment terminal  when it is transmitted through a processor  and when it is stored in a retailer s information systems  It also does not protect online transactions   The simplest way to circumvent chip and PIN is to use a stolen card number to make an online purchase   said Paul Kleinschnitz  a senior vice president for cyber security solutions at card processor First Data Corp  Analysts predict that credit card fraud at brick and mortar retailers will fall after the introduction of chip enabled cards  but that online fraud will rise  as has happened in other countries using the technology  Research and consulting firm Aite Group estimates U S  online card fraud will more than double to  6 6 billion from  3 3 billion between 2015 and 2018  Retailers and security experts say it would make more sense for the United States to jump instead to a more secure system  such as point to point encryption  This technology is superior to chip and PIN  which first was deployed about 20 years ago  because it scrambles data to make it unreadable from the moment a transaction starts  But the newer technology would cost as much as twice what the chip card transition will cost  and does not have the older technology s long track record  Moreover  some security experts say that mobile payment services such as Apple Pay  a service from Apple that stores data on the cloud  have the potential in coming years to secure payments without the need to swipe or tap a card at all  LIABILITY FOR BREACHES The dispute over the effectiveness of dueling payment security systems offers insight into a broader battle over who bears liability for breaches  retailers or the financial firms that extend the credit   Currently  card issuers are generally liable for fraudulent charges  After the October deadline  if a retailer is not using a terminal that can read the new cards and a security breach occurs involving a chip card  the retailer will be liable  though consumers will still deal with their banks in the event of a fraudulent charge  If the retailer is chip and PIN enabled  the card issuer will be liable   The liability issue has engendered anger on the part of some retailers  but it has also provided an incentive for compliance with the new standards   When banks and card companies are only concerned about shifting the liability to the retailer  you have to comply first   Brooks Brothers Chief Executive Officer Claudio Del Vecchio said   And then think of solutions that will fix your problems   The clothing retailer expects to meet the October deadline  but Del Vecchio declined to give details on the cost involved  Banks and card companies argue that chip enabled cards are a needed first step toward defending against the use of lost  stolen  or counterfeit cards   The first thing we need to do as a country is secure face to face transactions   said Carolyn Balfany  senior vice president of product delivery for MasterCard  one of the companies involved in setting the new standards known as EMV  which stands for Europay  MasterCard and Visa  And there are reasons that banks and card companies haven t yet embraced newer  more secure systems    A payment standard that is accepted globally will substantially reduce transaction costs for them   Rick Dakin  chief executive officer of cybersecurity risk and compliance firm Coalfire   Also they have already done the heavy lifting for EMV so they are ready and pushing for it   he said  Dakin  who is advising a group of banks on payment security  said no industry standard exists for the newer point to point encryption systems  and banks and card companies are hesitant to make large scale investments before the standards are set   Banks and card companies said a chip card alone can make stolen data less useful for hackers and the technology has worked in reducing counterfeit card fraud in Europe and elsewhere   Security experts said the shift cannot prevent massive consumer data breaches of the sort that recently hit Target and  Home Depot   NYSE HD   But the technology will make it more difficult to use stolen data   BIG SPEND With the October deadline approaching and the upgrade costs hitting retailers  income statements  some merchants remain unaware of the required changes  while others have renewed their focus on the shortcomings of chip technology   As the deadline approaches  retailers realize they are stuck with this massive investment they have to make for a technology that does not solve the problem   Dakin said  The installation of 15 million payment terminals that can read chip cards in the U S  will cost approximately  6 75 billion  Banks are expected to spend some  1 4 billion to issue new cards and another   5 billion to upgrade their Automated Teller Machines according to Javelin Strategy   Research  The upgrade of a single payment terminal to chip and PIN capability costs between  500 and  3000  depending on features  It would cost between  1000 and  4000 to install a point to point encryption terminal  security experts said    The problem now is how do we allocate our capital in a way that addresses EMV first and then immediately find the funds to upgrade again and install a better solution   said Grant Shih  vice president for IT development at kids clothing retailer Carter s Inc  For some small merchants  however  the problem is even more basic  Knowing what will be expected of them in October  Six of 10 small retailers in Chicago interviewed by Reuters said they had no idea about the deadline later this year and have no plans to upgrade their payment terminals  Three others said they had heard about the shift  but that their businesses were small and hadn t had problems with fraud that would justify the expense of installing new equipment  Only one business owner said she would like to upgrade terminals  though she says cost is an impediment  Anne Manion  owner of the women s clothing and accessories boutique Girl Hour said she doesn t think small businesses are as exposed to data breaches as large retailers are  but she is still thinking about reaching out to her bank about upgrading terminals at two of her stores   The cost implications are important and I m going to wait and see if by the end of the year there is a way to rent these terminals instead of buying them   she said  Manion already pays a  500 fee every month for the two card terminals she now has  The Retail Merchants Association said it believes a majority of small retailers are aware of the risks from card fraud but haven t started making the required investments yet  The group is developing a plan to explain the shift in liability and will start reaching out to smaller merchants soon  
 Many small retailers have a tendency to wait until the very last minute until they realize they absolutely have to spend that money because for them cash is king   said Sarah Paxton Vice Chairman of the Retail Merchants Association  in Richmond VA ",2015-03-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/costly-shift-to-new-credit-cards-won't-fix-security-issues-330559,330559

163650,385166,HD,Is Fossil  FOSL  Set To Disappoint This Earnings Season ,opinion,Fossil Group  Inc    NASDAQ FOSL   is slated to report first quarter 2017 results on May 9  after the closing bell  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this designer and manufacturer of clothing and accessories will be able to post a positive earnings surprise again in the to be reported quarter  The company s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight straight quarters now  with a trailing four quarter average of 32 2  Let s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement What Does the Zacks Model Unveil Our proven model does not show that Fossil is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Fossil Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Fossil has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 21 cents  Moreover  the company has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Which Way are Estimates Treading Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and 2017 has been stable over the last 30 days  However  the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 21 cents and  1 11 for the first quarter and 2017 are down from the earnings of 20 cents and  2 44 delivered in the year ago periods  respectively Moreover  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  596 5 million for the said quarter  down 9 6  from the year ago quarter  Also  revenues for 2017 are projected to decline 2 2  to  2 97 billion Factors Influencing the QuarterFossil is witnessing soft sales in the licensed watch portfolio and sluggish comparable store sales  comps  in the U S  due to weak traffic  The company is also facing economic challenges in many of its key international markets  In fact  all these factors along with a challenging environment for the traditional watch category and currency fluctuations had hurt the fourth quarter 2016 sales that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also declined year over year  Notably  the company s sales have lagged the same in seven of the past nine quarters Though the fourth quarter earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate  it fell 23 2  from the prior year quarter  mainly due to lower sales  gross margin and currency headwinds  Though Fossil s connected wearables and smartwatches are expected to gain momentum  the Watches category is likely to remain sluggish due to general weakness therein  We note that tech enabled watches have been significantly affecting traditional watch sales  Increased competition from new entrants in the market and volatility in sales pattern is also affecting the segment  The company continues to expect weakness in this category Further  the sales of leathers have persistently been weak as customer response to the assortment continues to put pressure on results  Higher promotional activity  primarily in the outlet stores and higher mix of lower margin products along with unfavorable currency are also keeping margins under pressure We note that shares of Fossil have plunged nearly 56  in the past one year compared with the Zacks categorized  industry s decline of 10 5   The industry is currently placed at bottom 2  of the Zacks Classified industries  250 out of 256  Further  Fossil forms part of the  sector that is currently placed at the bottom most of the Zacks Classified sectors  16 out of 16   Per the latest   the earnings growth for the sector is estimated to decline 2 2   despite an expected revenue growth of 3 3  in the first quarter Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY   has an Earnings ESP of  12 50  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  The Home Depot  Inc    NYSE HD   has an Earnings ESP of  0 62  and a Zacks Rank  2 Lowe s Companies  Inc    NYSE LOW   has an Earnings ESP of  2 83  and a Zacks Rank  3 Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to

Elevated earnings and economic expectations could lead to a pullback or more sideways action but we believe the bull market in U S  stocks will continue  If economic data continues to surprise on the upside  a March rate hike is likely to be on the table  while there is an additional risk that the Fed may be forced to speed up the tightening process should inflation accelerate from here

It s that time of year again   when refinery maintenance season kicks in and the market makes a shift to cleaner burning gasoline  disrupting production and lifting prices for the fuel at the pump  If prices see the average five year increase they usually do during the spring  retail gasoline could cost an average  2 85 a gallon around Memorial Day 
Crude oil prices have been moving higher and OPEC said it was sticking to its agreement to cut production by about 1 8 million barrels per day to drain a glut that has depressed prices for over two years  OPEC compliance is helping keep prices afloat  but rising US oil production is acting as a counterweight  the result is a glut of crude supplies 
Here s the hitch  the glut of gasoline is now the worst in 27 years  At 259 million barrels  U S  gasoline storage levels are now at their highest level since the Energy Information Administration began tracking the data back in 1990  If both crude and refined product inventories are going up at the same time  then there should be some reasons for worry 
Part of the reason for the glut  of course  are high levels of production  around 9 to 10 million bpd  But that increase came to satisfy rising demand  which  of course  was stoked by lower prices   More demand should have soaked up that excess supply 
However  U S  demand has faltered  U S  gasoline demand plunged to just 8 2 million barrels per day in January  and sales were down 4 percent from a year earlier  It was also the lowest level in four years  Weak demand is raising some red flags for the market 
Demand is seasonal  with softer demand in winter months  but this winter s  valley  is lower than any other since 2012  The glut of gasoline has led to tankers being turned away at New York Harbor in recent weeks  diverted to ports in the Caribbean 
If demand does not rebound  inventories will rise  pushing prices lower  So  while OPEC production cuts are important  keep an eye on U S  demand  not just for oil prices but also as a barometer of overall economic activity 
The Department of Homeland Security issued a sweeping set of orders today that implement President Trump s plan to increase immigration enforcement  placing the clear majority of the nation s 11 million undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation  The memos instruct all agents   including Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement   to identify  capture and quickly deport every undocumented immigrant they encounter 
The memos require undocumented immigrants caught entering the country to be placed in detention until their cases are resolved  increase the ability of local police to help in immigration enforcement  call for the hiring of 10 000 more immigration agents and allow planning to begin on an expansion of the border wall between the United States and Mexico 
The memos make undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of a crime the highest priority for enforcement operations  But they make clear that ICE agents should also arrest and initiate deportation proceedings against any other undocumented immigrant they encounter 
These new guidelines  however  leave untouched the executive order signed by former President Barack Obama in 2012 on deferred action for childhood arrivals  which shields from deportation immigrants who were brought to the U S  as children ",2017-02-22,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/again-and-again-200176494,200176494
163687,385203,HD,Stocks Prices Surge Ever Higher  Supported by Retail Sales And The Oil,opinion,"Reuters  that U S  stock index futures rose to record intraday highs on Tuesday as oil prices surged and investors assessed earnings from top U S  retailers 
The theory is share prices are being driven higher by a strong oil price and retailers who are reporting better than expected store sales  Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   Macy s  NYSE M   and Home Depot  NYSE HD  sales are all up on robust consumer demand  If stock prices were supported on consumer confidence alone  we could see an argument for this bull run in share prices to continue 
There is plenty of optimism around Donald Trump s much vaunted infrastructure projects are expected to create significant demand and have an inflationary impact on the economy  when they eventually see the light of day  2018 at the earliest is our expectation  since few are shovel ready and all will have to get past Congress first  Meanwhile  though  the economy is adding jobs at a steady rate and unemployment is low 
Oil Supply
However  if Reuters is right and shares are being driven higher in part due to the oil price  we have a few concerns  The oil price was driven higher by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  production cap agreement last year  an agreement to which both major OPEC producers and 11 non OPEC countries like Russia signed up to in an effort to reduce excess production and bring the market into balance by the summer 
A report in the Telegraph blows support for that case wide open  Evidence from shipping data suggests producers are cutting production nowhere near the 1 8 million barrels a day pledged by OPEC and non OPEC states last November  The newspaper quotes sources estimating non OPEC countries  including Russia  are delivering only 40  of the cuts pledged with Russia itself only cutting 100 000 barrels per day from a promised 300 000 bpd  Saudi Arabia is keeping to production cuts  but exports remain high as the cuts are being delivered domestically as the country switches from oil to natural gas for power production 
Venezuela  Algeria  Iraq and the United Arab Emirates are increasing output over their reference levels  Meanwhile  the U S  shale industry is making significant strides in reducing costs and improving efficiency allowing operators to make a return at an oil price well below current levels   54 per barrel is now the breakeven norm with some down to  40  the newspaper says 
Not surprisingly  rig counts and production are strongly rising  The Baker Hughes rig count rose to 597 rigs last week  almost double the level it dropped to in May last year and Bank of America expects shale frackers to add 600 000 bpd of output this year negating the real cuts managed by the OPEC deal 
Unfortunately  net long positions in oil have risen to 812 000 lots  higher than at any time in the last five years and putting the market at risk of a correction if  longs  lose faith and start to liquidate  Such moves have a snowball effect and can initiate a sharp correction  Not that we are predicting an oil price crash  but the case for higher prices is looking less convincing than many have assumed 
If that proves to be the case one plank for ever higher share prices will also be withdrawn  Generally mature and emerging markets are recovering well and continued low interest rates are supporting markets but the Federal Reserve will put up rates this year and  should a sharp correction in oil prices develop if the OPEC  cap  is not renewed at expiration this summer  we could see a retrenchment in what is already the second longest stock market bull run in modern times  Eventually  all good things come to an end ",2017-02-22,MetalMiner,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-prices-surge-ever-higher,-supported-by-retail-sales-and-the-oil-200176511",200176511

Making Sense of Retail s Q3 Earnings Results

	The Retail sector s Q3 results reconfirm the struggles of traditional brick and mortar operators with falling foot traffic as a result of sales shifting to the online medium  That said  the list of winners and losers this earnings season offers a mixed picture  in practically every Retail category 


	The market liked Target s  NYSE     results  but wasn t happy with Wal Mart s  NYSE    Home Depot  NYSE    did fine butLowe s  NYSE    disappointed  whileThe Children s Place  Nasdaq     came out shining  The department store results were broadly well received  But as discussed in this space earlier  the department store outperformance was largely a function of cost controls and inventory management 
	It is tough to be a traditional retailer in this environment of shifting consumer preferences  The one positive factor for the space is the favorable consumer spending outlook  a beneficiary of the steadily improving labor market and signs of wages gains  This favorable macro spending backdrop should help the Retail space in the coming quarters  particularly the all important holiday shopping season  But it isn t a case of the rising tide lifting all boats  with the winners and losers dependent on execution and management effectiveness Retail Sector Scorecard
	As of Friday November 18th  we have seen Q3 results from 36 retailers in the S P 500 index  out of the 43 total  that combined account for 94  of the sector s total market cap in the index  Total earnings for these 36 retails are up  7 4  from the same period last year  on  4 9  higher revenues  with a relatively low 61 1  beating EPS estimates and a very low 44 4  coming ahead of top line expectations  The proportion of retailers that have beaten Q3 EPS and revenue estimates is the second lowest of all 16 Zacks sectors  behind only Construction 

	The group s Q3 earnings growth compares favorably with historical periods  though top line growth is tracking below the 4  and 12 quarter averages  Positive surprises are notably hard to come by in Q3  both for earnings as well as revenues  The proportion of Retail sector companies beating EPS estimates is the second lowest of all 16 sectors in the index  with the sector the 6th lowest with respect to revenue surprises Q3 Earnings Scorecard  as of 11 18 2016 
	We now have Q3 results from 476 S P 500 members or 95 2  of the index s total membership  Total earnings for these 476 companies are up  4 0  from the same period last year on  2 6  higher revenues  with 73 1  beating EPS estimates and 55 5  coming ahead of revenue estimates 
	We have reached the final phase of the reporting cycle  with only 13 S P 500 members reporting results this week  Any way you look at it  this is better performance than we have seen from the same group of 476 index members in other recent periods 

	The aggregate growth picture improves even further once the Energy sector s drag is removed  Excluding the Energy sector  total earnings for the rest index members that have reported are up  7 4  on  4 3  higher revenues 

Q3 Expectations as a Whole
	Combining the actual results from the 476 S P 500 members with estimates from the still to come 24 index members  total Q3 earnings are now expected to be up  3 6  from the same period last year on  1 5  higher revenues  The  3 6  earnings growth in Q3 is the first positive growth for the index after 5 quarters of back to back declines 
	The Q3 earnings growth may not be much  but it is nevertheless a notable improvement over what we saw in the preceding 5 quarters 

	Positive growth was expected to show up in the last quarter of the year  with pre season expectations putting Q3 growth in negative territory  In other words  not only has the earnings recession finally come to an end  but positive growth has arrived ahead of schedule  In a way  Q3 can be seen as an inflection point Expectations Beyond Q3
	The Energy sector drag is expected to end in 2016 Q4 and beyond 

	The improved Energy sector outlook makes sense  given shifting comparisons and the improvement in oil prices  But we will have to wait to find out if estimates for the other sectors will hold up as companies report Q3 results and provide guidance for Q4 and beyond 
	It will be interesting to see if the decelerated pace of negative revisions that we saw the last earnings season will get repeated this time as well

163739,385255,HD,Markets  Trumpophobia To Trumpophoria And Central Bank Lessons,opinion,"Zimbabwe competes with Venezuela for first place in the contest of the most poorly governed regimes that have hyperinflation policies  Here is the latest chapter in dictator Robert Mugabe s attempt to destroy what remains of any capital in that country 
In Venezuela  Hugo Chavez s successor  Nicol s Maduro  has presided over a hyperinflation of the Venezuelan bolivar that is most reliably measured by an index operated by a former Venezuelan army officer who now works at a Home Depot  NYSE HD  in Hoover  Alabama  Bottom line  the people of Venezuela are struggling to find food and to pay for it when they do  Just this week  the Venezuelan government introduced six new banknotes in denominations ranging from 500 to 20 000 bol vares  In the hyperinflationary environment  the new 500 bol var banknote replaces the 5  the 10 000 replaces the 100  and so on   See  
There are other cases we can cite in the world  but these two are enough to verify that all is not perfect in the global paradise celebrated by stock market highs 
Meanwhile  Islamic countries now have the religious imprimatur to add gold holdings to portfolios under  Shariah compliant  Islamic law  How this religious policy will evolve to monetary policy depends on substitution effects 
Right now the US dollar trumps  pun intended  everything else  and rising interest rates in the US are drawing flows into our currency  How long this trend lasts is anyone s guess  but it seems solid for the moment 
Trumpophoria is a wonderful salve for stock market participants  We have had a marvelous year in our US ETF accounts  But there comes a time to take some off the table and leave the excesses to others 
Last week  as the markets made new highs  we did some selling and raised a cash reserve  We lowered our stock allocation in steps  And we seized opportunity in the tax free bond sector  where yields backed up to over 130  of taxable Treasury bonds at the same time that Treasury yields have risen dramatically  Munis are now cheap 
At best  stocks are fully priced  There is little margin for a stumble now  Trumponomics has its limits  and a 2250 starting point on the S P Index gives us reason to no longer be fully invested  Three flat years of earnings at  118 are expected to be replaced by about  123 4 in the coming year  Let s call it an 18 19 p e and an earnings yield of 5 5   With treasury interest rates up and heading higher  the equity risk premium says the stock market is no bargain 
It has been an extraordinary year in the stock market  Earlier this year the equity risk premium was a full point higher and we were fully invested  A little profit in the bank now feels good 
Two decades ago Alan Greenspan gave his famous  irrational exuberance  speech  The link to its text is below  Note his historical references 
We think Greenspan warned early but accurately  Trumpophobia has morphed to Trumpophoria  But investment decision making is not a reality TV show that always comes on at 8 PM on Tuesday  In the investing world timing is always uncertain 
Reality TV is different than reality investing  We have a cash reserve in place in our US ETF portfolios

163741,385257,HD,Supervalu says malware affects four stores in Minnesota,news," Reuters    Supermarket chain Supervalu Inc  N SVU  reported on Monday a second attack against its payment systems barely two months after it said it was investigating a potential data breach 
The company said it found malicious software on a part of its network that might have affected payment cards used at four of its Cub Foods franchise stores in Hastings  Shakopee  Roseville and White Bear Lake  Minnesota 
The company said an intruder installed different malware on some parts of its computer network in late August or early September at some of its retail  food and associated stand alone liquor stores 
The retailer  which operates 3 320 outlets in the United States  said this security breach was separate from the one it reported on Aug  14 
Supervalu said the malware could have recorded account numbers  payment card expiration dates and cardholder names from cards used at the four Cub Foods stores between Aug  27 and Sep  21  These stores had yet to implement its protective technology 
The supermarket operator believed the malware had not succeeded in capturing data from payment cards used at any of its other stores  where it had implemented protective technology 
The attacks are not expected to have an adverse impact on its financial results or position  the company said 
Supervalu also said it notified federal law enforcement authorities and is cooperating in the investigation of the intrusion  It also notified the major payment card brands 
Cyber attacks at retailers and corporations have been growing as cyber criminals use increasingly sophisticated attacks to hack into networks and steal valuable data 
Home improvement chain Home Depot Inc  N HD  said earlier this month that about 56 million payment cards were likely compromised in a cyber attack at its stores 
Home Depot said criminals used unique  custom built software that had not been seen in previous attacks and was designed to evade detection 
Restaurant chain Jimmy John s also said last week there was a potential security breach involving customer credit and debit card data at 216 of its stores and franchised locations 
Supervalu shares were down about 1 8 percent in extended trading on Monday

163783,385299,HD,The Home Depot Stock Earnings Preview,opinion,"The Home Depot  Inc  NYSE HD  The Home Depot  Inc  will report its fiscal third quarter 2016 results before the market open Tuesday  November 15  2016  The street consensus is for  1 58 earnings per share on  23 04 billion in revenues  Lets take a closer look at what the analysts have to say 
HD Analyst Opinion

Analysts at Wedbush securities had the following comments leading up to The Home Depot s earnings release 
The Wedbush View 

We expect HD to report a solid 3Q16 on Tuesday  November 15 BMO  but see potential for moderating growth over the next two quarters  Despite a likely stronger finish to the quarter that creates more upside than downside risk to our and the consensus 4 5  comp estimate  4 9  U S    mixed macro signals  uncertain consumer behavior following the presidential election tough comparisons and our leading indicator model point to slower sales growth ahead  
While HD s execution remains strong  enabling it to maintain outperformance vs  a less consistent LOW  and many internal growth drivers remain intact  a less sanguine outlook keeps us sidelined on HD  Big ticket a focus  slower demand and tougher comparisons in 2H16  HD s big ticket comps are facing their toughest compares of the year as reports from other discretionary product retailers point to softness  
Appliances  for example  have aided HD comps by  50 bps for the last three quarters  Indications from both Whirlpool and Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers  AHAM  North American T6 unit shipment data albeit rebounding in September from a softer July August suggest softer sales trends in 3Q16  The appliance replacement cycle may be in the later stages based on a typical 10 year replacement rate and appliance sales peaking in the middle of last decade  
Slowing trends coupled with increased competition from new entrants such as J C  Penney  JCP  and promotional activity in the category  LOW  will likely reduce the  50 bps comp boost HD has been getting from appliances in recent quarters  This slowing demand may be partially offset by an increasing mix of Pro sales  which typically carry higher tickets

On average  Wall Street analysts expected the Atlanta based company to report Q3 EPS of  1 58  with revenues rise 6  from last year to  23 billion  For the full year 2016  analysts are looking for  6 33 per share  with 6  revenue growth to  94 15 billion 
Last quarter  HD lifted its full year EPS outlook to  6 31  up from a prior forecast of  6 27  citing better expense controls  It will be interesting to see if the the company boosts its full year target again this time around 
As of a few months ago  Home Depot expected full year sales to rise 6 3  to about  94 1 billion  with same store sales growth of 4 9   Same store sales  also known as comparable sales  are considered a key indicator of a brick and mortar retailer s performance  since they measure only the results from stores open at least 12 months 
Home Depot is often looked at as a bellwether for the U S  economy as a whole  since construction projects and home remodels are generally bullish signs for economic activity  The company may also benefit from president elect Trump s big infrastructure spending plan 
Analysts at JP Morgan put out a note today that wasn t so bullish  however  noting 

 Investor sentiment for Home Depot and Lowe s has soured due to cyclical concerns as indicated by softness in year over year existing home sales   0 3  quarter to date versus  5  in the first half of 2016   greater demand volatility  and questionable category weakness  for example  paint appliances  and rough plumbing and electrical  

So  will the company be able to buck economic headwinds  or will results disappoint  Stay tuned here tomorrow morning  when we ll have full coverage of HD s report

163811,385327,HD,Macy s  Kohl s  Wal Mart  Target And Home Depot Are Part Of Zacks Earnings Preview,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   November 14  2016   Zacks com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises  This week s list includesMacy s  NYSE       Kohl s  NYSE     Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   NYSE     Target  NYSE     and Home Depot  NYSE HD   NYSE      

	To see more earnings analysis  visit     

Retail Sector s Mixed Q3 Showing

	The earnings focus lately has been on the Retail sector  with department store results getting positive reception from the market  Investors are rewarding the department store stocks for showing some improvement in results  with tight expense controls and leaner inventories as the big drivers even as same store sales continue to struggle  The lean inventory picture is helping raise hopes for the all important fourth quarter for Macy s  NYSE     and Kohl s  NYSE       as they likely wouldn t need to do as much discounting to move merchandize 

	The current sunshine on department store stocks notwithstanding  the group s long standing problems haven t gone away  These problems include steadily falling foot traffic as a result of sales moving to the online channel  which is making the group s excessive store capacity ever more problematic  Macy s announcement of partnering with Brookfield Asset Management with respect to its real estate portfolio  which follows the decision to close 100 locations last quarter  is step towards addressing the  over stored  ground reality Retail Sector Scorecard
	As of Friday November 11th  we have seen Q3 results from 24 retailers in the S P 500 index  out of the 43 total  that combined account for 59 3  of the sector s total market cap in the index  Total earnings for these 24 retails are up  12 7  from the same period last year  on  8 6  higher revenues  with a relatively low 54 2  beating EPS estimates and a very low 37 5  coming ahead of top line expectations  The proportion of retailers that have beaten Q3 EPS and revenue estimates is the second lowest of all 16 Zacks sectors  behind only Construction 
	Positive surprises are notably hard to come by in Q3  both for earnings as well as revenues  While the department store results in recent days have largely been well received  the earlier reports from online vendors  restaurants and other retail spaces largely came short of expectations  We will get Retail s complete picture following this week s results from Wal Mart  NYSE      Target  NYSE     andHome Depot  NYSE        but the sector s Q3 results thus far have at best been mixed Q3 Earnings Scorecard    as of 11 11 2016 
	We now have Q3 results from 455 S P 500 members or 91  of the index s total membership  Total earnings for these 455 companies are up  3 9  from the same period last year on  2 7  higher revenues  with 72 7  beating EPS estimates and 55 4  coming ahead of revenue estimates 
	We have reached the final phase of the reporting cycle  with only 21 S P 500 members reporting results this week 

	Any way you look at it  this is a better performance than we have seen from the same group of 455 index members in other recent periods 

	The aggregate growth picture improves even further once the Energy sector s drag is removed  Excluding the Energy sector  total earnings for the rest index members that have reported are up  7 5  on  4 5  higher revenues 

Q3 Expectations As a Whole
	Combining the actual results from the 455 S P 500 members with estimates from the still to come 45 index members  total Q3 earnings are now expected to be up  3 4  from the same period last year on  1 5  higher revenues  This would compare to 2016 Q2 earnings growth of  2 8  on  0 2  revenues 

	The  3 4  earnings growth in Q3 is the first positive growth for the index after 5 quarters of back to back declines  The growth picture improves once the Energy sector s drag is excluded  as you can see in the table above   6 7   
	The Q3 earnings growth may not be much  but it is nevertheless a notable improvement over what we saw in the preceding 5 quarters 

	Positive growth was expected to show up in the last quarter of the year  with pre season expectations putting Q3 growth to be in negative territory  In other words  not only has the earnings recession finally come to an end  but positive growth has arrived ahead of schedule  In a way  Q3 can be seen as an inflection point Expectations Beyond Q3

	The Energy sector drag is expected to end in 2016 Q4 and beyond  This outlook makes sense  given shifting comparisons and the improvement in oil prices  But we will have to wait to find out if estimates for the other sectors will hold up as companies report Q3 results and provide guidance for Q4 and beyond 
	It will be interesting to see if the decelerated pace of negative revisions that we saw the last earnings season will get repeated this time as well Note    Sheraz Mian regularly provides earnings analysis on Zacks com and appears frequently in the print and electronic media  In addition to this Earnings Preview article  he publishes the     report every week

163812,385328,HD,Will Market Rally Continue  ,opinion,"Following the best week in the Dow for the past five years  market futures are relatively tepid early this Monday  The immense relief rally that followed the year and a half long marathon of the U S  General Election  and the subsequent hopefulness in the Pharma  Finance and Construction spaces from a President Trump administration helped markets rise  bigly  last week 
Further  we saw the Volatility Index  VIX  fall precipitously in the week  tumbling to its third largest weekly drop in history  the steepest week long drop was the week following Great Britain s Brexit vote   Meanwhile  the 10 year bond yield shot up to its highest level since the beginning of the year  and continues to ride higher this morning at over 2 2   The 10 year had been wallowing in 1 7  territory throughout most of the summer  Yields are rising at the same time the stock market is rising   how long can we expect this to last 
Also  Q3 winds down ahead of holiday season  with just 21 S P 500 companies remaining to report this week  mostly in big box retail  Earnings from companies like Home Depot  NYSE HD   Tuesday  Cisco  and Target  Wednesday  Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   Thursday and Foot Locker  NYSE FL   Friday are some of the biggest names we expect to be hearing from this week 
Q3 earnings season will have been the first quarter in the the last six to bring positive earnings results in aggregate  breaking a five quarters long earnings recession in the U S  In other words  the last time before Q3 2016 we saw positive earnings results was back before the presidential election had gotten underway 
Looking ahead  we do see weakness in the oil market  An OPEC meeting scheduled for later this month appears to have its work cut out for itself  at least in terms of oil rich nations agreeing to cut back production and work down the global supply glut that has created headwinds for the market over the past year plus  Ahead of today s bell  we see the WTI  1 1  and Brent crude  0 9  
Market indices had been mixed earlier this morning  but a half hour before the opening bell we are again in positive territory  S P 500  6 5  Dow  73 and Nasdaq  0 25  The tech heavy Nasdaq has seen the most pressure since Donald Trump won the election  as tech services and manufacturing being heavily reliant on Asian markets look to have the toughest time fighting through new presidential policies ",2016-11-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-market-rally-continue-200164546,200164546

163833,385349,HD,J C  Penney  SONIC  BHP Billiton  Wellcare Heath And ST Microelectronics Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   October 11  2016    highlights J C  Penney Company  Inc   NYSE     as the Bull of the Day and SONIC Corporation  NASDAQ     as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on BHP Billiton  LON BLT   NYSE    Wellcare Heath  NYSE    andST Microelectronics  NYSE     

Here is a synopsis of all the five stocks  

  

J C  Penney Company  Inc   NYSE     isn t dead yet  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  has completely turned itself around and is expected to be profitable this year and next 

J  C  Penny is one of the oldest apparel and home furnishing retailers in the United States  operating over 1 000 store locations in the U S  and Puerto Rico and its online website 

4 Big Beats in a Row

Last year  Wall Street left J C  Penney for dead as earnings and revenue spiraled lower  pushed by the relentless attacks on the old model department store 

It looked like the retailer was going to go the way of Montgomery Ward 

But the company got a new CEO in 2015 in Marvin Ellison  He had been at Home Depot  NYSE HD  and brought Home Depot s sensibility over to the clothing retailer 

It looks to be working  J C  Penney has beat the street 4 quarters in a row 

It s second quarter beat was by  0 10  as the company reported a loss of  0 05 versus the Zacks Consensus of  0 15 

Comparable store sales rose 2 2  as its top selling divisions were beauty and cosmetics company Sephora  Home and Footwear and Handbags 

Geographically  the Ohio Valley and the Pacific were the two best performing regions 

Beauty and Appliances

Its alliance with Sephora continues to give the stores a big boost  It will be rolling out more in store Sephora locations over the next few years 

It also recently started an aggressive national advertising campaign touting its appliances  It will roll out appliance sales in 500 stores and on  

To compete with online retailers  it is also rolling out same day in store pickup 

Earnings Estimates Rise

In August  J C  Penney reaffirmed its full year guidance which included comparable store sales of 3  to 4  

It also presented its 3 year strategy for growth which included annual compounded comparable sales growth of 3  

The analysts liked what they heard as 10 estimates were raised for fiscal 2016 in the last 2 months  1 analyst recently lowered estimates however 

Still  the analysts believe J C  Penney will return to profitability this year  The fiscal 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate jumped to  0 16 from  0 05 in that time period 

The company lost  1 03 last year so that is earnings growth of 115  

Analysts are also bullish about fiscal 2017  The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to  0 72 from  0 69 in the last 30 days 

That s earnings growth of 345  

The CEO Dives In and Buys More Shares

It s not just the analysts who are buying into the turnaround story 

The new CEO has bought shares twice in 2016  His first open market purchase was in march 2016 when he bought 50 000 shares 

He recently bought another 50 000 shares on August 25  2016 

He has over 2 5 million shares and gets awards from the company  When an insider buys more shares using their own cash it sends a bullish signal 

Many buy because they believe the shares are likely to go higher 

Are Shares Cheap 

Share sold off to multi year lows in recent years on the belief that the company may not survive 

They haven t recovered much and have yet to break out to even a 2 year high 

  



SONIC Corporation  NASDAQ     had been crushing it in the burger wars for several years  But this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  just warned about its fourth quarter results 

Are burgers going out of favor in America 

Sonic is America s largest drive in restaurant chain with 3500 locations  For over 60 years it has served customers and now sees about 3 million customers a day 

Warned on the Fourth Quarter

On Sep 27  Sonic issued preliminary results for its fiscal fourth quarter which ended Aug 31 and it wasn t good 

Same store sales fell 2  with a decrease of 3  at company owned drive ins and 1 8  at franchise drive ins 

The disappointing sales was the result of lower than expected traffic  as consumers spent less eating out  and aggressive competition in the burger industry  There are a LOT of burger chains now  all competing for the same dollars 

Still  the company continues to expand  It opened 53 new drive ins in fiscal 2016 

Estimates Cut

The analysts didn t like what they heard as 8 estimates were cut for fiscal 2016 and 8 were also cut for next year 

The fiscal 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate fell to  1 29 from  1 33  that s still earnings growth of 17 4  compared to the prior year 

The fiscal 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate fell  0 10 to  1 41 from  1 51  While you never want to see estimate cuts  it still results in 2017 earnings growth of 9 4

When Rich Nation Growth Stagnates  Zacks Market Strategy

The latest Zacks Market Strategy report holds two provocative insights hailing from advanced  translation   countries  First  rich nations other than the USA struggle to build any real GDP growth momentum  Second  their consumer price inflation looks subdued vis   vis the USA  too 

U K  in Denial About Looming Brexit GDP Weakness

Let s start with the latest news from the U K  Frosh U K  Prime Minister Theresa May now says Brexit begins by the end of March 2017 

According to comments published in the Financial Times  whichever way you look at it  things aren t pretty for the U K  pound  And the U K  pound has already hit lows last seen in 1985 

A number of major FX strategists expect things to get messier still 

With a  6  flash crash in hand  I can t say I disagree with what was written by these pessimistic FX strategists  The U K  pound is headed lower  But the export sensitivity of U K  FTSE stocks keeps the share markets there headed higher   for now 

When we see U K  stocks crash  due to U K  macroeconomic weakness showing up  then the political tone may well change 

The narrative away from the USA interested me this month  as I looked further into the matter of advanced nation GDP growth stagnation  Check out this writing from USA economists on the West Coast 

Output Growth in Advanced Countries STAGNANT   San Fran Fed

 In particular   San Fran Fed economists say  output growth in other advanced economies  such as the Euro area and Japan  has been relatively stagnant since the global financial crisis  Foreign inflation has also been subdued in comparison with the United States  

 These differences in economic performance have resulted in diverging monetary policy stances  The United States has begun to normalize its monetary policy and is expected to tighten it more in the future  

 In contrast  the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have eased monetary policy further through more negative rates on reserve deposits and greater quantitative easing and both central banks are expected to stay very accommodative in the near term  

 This divergence in policy paths has increased demand for U S  assets by foreign investors seeking higher returns  and further pushed U S  long term interest rates down   

GDPNow Has USA GDP Growth at  2 2  in Q3

The USA is staying only a small step ahead of advanced country GDP growth doldrums  with  2 2  GDP growth forecast for Q3 16  But USA consumer spending is holding up much better  According to the Atlanta Fed s GDPNow growth tracker on Oct  5th  third quarter real consumer spending was  2 7  y y 

On that relatively upbeat note  I found the Zacks Industry Ranks to show lots of medium upgrades    and no real loser sectors this month 

Zacks Sector Industry Company Telescope   USA Consumer Is Lively

On Monday  the International Monetary Fund trimmed its 2014 U S  economic growth forecast to 2  from 2 8  due to a harsh winter and a  still struggling housing market   though markets bet the Fed s take on the economy will be positive even with a few clouds on the horizon

According to a  by John Burns Real Estate Consulting and the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies  spending on home repairs and remodeling is expected to exceed  300 billion this year  ahead of the previous high of about  285 billion in 2007 

With very low inventories of homes for sale and rising prices  many homeowners prefer to improve their existing home instead of buying a new one  Further  American homes are getting older  leading to rising spending on repairs  With improving labor market  homeowners are also willing to spend more on upgrades and remodeling 

The study forecasts that home improvement spending will continue to grow at a fast pace over the next three years  These trends bode well for the company  Further  being a domestically focused company  it is immune to global growth concerns

163875,385391,HD,Fed Like A  Cowardly Scarecrow  As Corporate Debt Bubble Expands,opinion,"Thanks to massive stimulus that the Fed can never seem to unwind despite promising to do so for years  the  






What has the analysts uneasy isn t just the speed at which leverage is climbing  but that it s happening while the economy continues to grow 
 Leverage tends to rise most in a recession   so the fact that it is this high in a  healthy economy  is even more concerning   the analysts wrote  In other words  they said   mistakes are both more likely and more costly  
Corporate bond issuance this year is on pace to exceed last year s record  1 3 trillion  data compiled by Bloomberg show  That would push sales during the past five years to more than  6 trillion  Companies that sold dollar bonds this week included Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD    Cox Communications Inc  and TJX Cos 
Total debt at companies grew steadily at about 10 percent year on year since 2009 and accelerated to 16 percent year on year at the end of 2015  As that happened  Ebitda fell 4 percent for twelve months through the end of 2015  according to the report 
Debt loads are swelling across most all industries  the analysts said  But it s been most pronounced among energy and healthcare companies  Companies have also borrowed to buyback stock rather than investing  a factor that contributed to weak productivity in the U S  economy  and that does not  bode well for earnings   the analysts wrote

163917,385433,HD,5 Stocks To Watch  HD  DKS  TJX  WMT  GPS,opinion,"Home Depot  NYSE HD 
Consumer Discretionary   Specialty Retail   Reports August 16  before the open 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings of  1 98 per share on  26 49 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  17 million higher on the top  Compared to a year earlier  earnings are expected to increase by 15  with revenue increasing 7   Investors should expect to see a small pop after the company reports  Typically the stock increases 2  immediately following a report  Shares of Home Depot are currently up 17  in the past 12 months  but haven t fared as well in 2016 

What to Watch  Home Depot has outperformed the Estimize consensus in each of the last 3 quarters  That streak extends to 8 consecutive quarters when compared to Wall Street s expectations  The broader recovery in the housing market and focus on improving customer experience have been key to Home Depot s recent streak  With new and existing home sales making further strides  don t expect earnings to falter in the upcoming report 
Low interest rates can be largely credited with the broader housing recovery since the financial crisis  As home sales steadily improve that will continue to drive traffic trends  Not only does Home Depot benefit from an increase in new home sales  but as home prices stay high  consumers tend to invest heavily into their properties  Strong job growth has also supported this ongoing trend  allowing consumers to spend on home improvement projects 
Home Depot is also putting forward strategic initiatives to drive sales  In response to the evolving retail environment  Home Depot is diligently devoting resources to its ecommerce platform  Last quarter online sales growth topped 21   consistent with the double digit gains in previous quarters  A majority of online sales are typically picked up in stores which promote in store sales 
Dick s Sporting Goods Inc   NYSE DKS 
Consumer Discretionary   Specialty Retail   Reports August 16  before the open 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of 69 cents  down 10  from the same period last year  That estimate has dropped 11  since DKS most recent report in May  Revenue is anticipated to grow by 4  to  1 89 billion  a marked slowdown from past quarters  Fortunately  weak earnings haven t held back the stock which just recently reached its 52 week high  The stock is up 7  in the past 12 months  but typically don t move following a quarterly report 

What to Watch  Dick s has been trending down the past couple of quarters  dragged lower by slowing sales and negative bottom line growth  Based on analyst s estimates  Dicks appears to be headed for another weak quarter  However  the ongoing bounce back in the retail sector  Sports Authority bankruptcy  and strong quarter from competitor Big 5 Sporting Goods  could be a strong indicator of a surprise 
Dick s has been hit hardest from the continual transition towards athleisure trends and ecommerce  Many of the retailer s initiatives have been to solve these ongoing troubles  including expanding its e commerce network and putting forward new marketing and merchandising efforts  Dick s is also planning to open 100s of new stores in order to return to profitability and sales growth  Sports Authority s bankcruptcy this year should provide Dick s with a fresh influx of customers 
Earnings prospects are still low despite continued efforts to jumpstart growth  Management lowered its fiscal 2016 and second quarter guidance after a bleak first quarter  For the second quarter  management expects earnings per share in the range of  0 62    0 72 cents  Same store sales are projected in the range of  4  to  1  after growing 0 5  last quarter 
The TJX Companies  NYSE TJX 
Consumer Discretionary   Specialty Retail   Reports August 16  before the open 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of 83 cents  4  higher than the same period a year earlier  That estimate hasn t moved since TJX s most recent report in May  Revenue is anticipated to jump 7  to 7 91 billion  a marginal slowdown from previous quarters  The market typically react well to the company s report  Shares  on average  increase 1   immediately following a report  reaching 2  gains in the 30 days following 

What to Watch  TJX is probably best known as the parent company of TJ Maxx  Marshalls  LON MSLH   HomeGoods and now Sierra Trade Post  The recent acquisition of the Australian based company will be used to expand its global presence and boost revenue  Generally speaking  TJX companies have been performing modestly lately  Quarterly results have topped expectations for 4 consecutive quarters  driven by value focused consumers  With better than expected results from Macy s  Kohl s  and JCPenney last week  it would appear TJX is well on its way to another strong report 
TJX has been largely resilient through rising popularity of online retailers  They ve seen modest growth the past few quarters driven by improving traffic trends  solid comparable store sales growth and higher margins  Increased marketing and promotional initiatives can be credited with this recent uptake  The acquisition of Sierra Trade Post adds a new layer of revenue and a means to widen its worldwide footprint 
Based on previous guidance  second quarter earnings are expected in the range of 77 cents to 79 cents  Clearly the Estimize community is bullish that the company will eclipse that mark by a fairly wide margin  Revenue targets are also well above guidance from the prior quarter 
Wal Mart  NYSE WMT 
Consumer Staples   Food   Staples Retailing   Reports August 18  before the open 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  1 04 on  120 39 billion in revenue  2 cents above Wall Street on the bottom line and  305 million higher on the top  Compared to a year earlier this reflects a 4  decrease in earnings and flat sales  Earnings estimates have increased 3  since the last quarterly report  with sales estimates unchanged 

What to watch  Negative year over year profit growth for the last 5 consecutive quarters has been mostly driven by increased labor costs and the impact of the stronger dollar  Revenues that turned negative in the last two quarters of Wal Mart s fiscal 2016 also suggest stiff competition from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  is at play here as well  Despite the downturns on the top and bottom line  same store sales have actually come in positive for the last 7 quarters  For the quarter reporting this Thursday  the world s largest retailer is guiding for US same store sales growth in the range of 1    3  
As improvements to its online platform have contributed to overall company sales  it s clear that Wal Mart is doubling down on ecommerce space  Just two weeks ago the company purchased online retailer  jet com  for  3 billion  in an effort to directly taking on the currently reigning Amazon  WMT also sold it s Chinese e commerce business  Yihaodian  to Chinese online retailer JD com in order to expand its international e commerce presence 
Year to date the stock is up a whopping 21   but historically stays flat after an earnings report 
Gap Inc   NYSE GPS 
Consumer Discretionary   Specialty Retail   Reports August 18  after the close 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 55  3 cents higher than Wall Street s consensus  Revenue expectations are in line at  3 8 billion  Earnings expectations have trended upward by 11  since last quarter  while revenue estimates are up 1   This puts YoY growth expectations at  19  for EPS and  3  for sales 

What to Watch  We got our first peek at what to expect from Gap s Q2 results when they released same store sales results on August 8  Gap comp store sales for the second quarter were down 2  versus the prior year  with negative results from both the company s namesake stores and Banana Republic  and Old Navy turning up flat  Slowing traffic and currency headwinds continue to be the culprits of dismal results 
For the second quarter  Gap is guiding for EPS in the range of  0 58    0 59  higher than what the Estimize community is currently expecting  The company believes progress in streamlining initiatives and improvements to larger brands will contribute to the bottom line  In particular  efforts to improve their off price brand  Old Navy  seem to be working thus far 
In a world where fast fashion is stealing market share from traditional retailers  Gap needs to revise its product portfolio in a way that is appealing to customers  something they have struggled with in the past  In a sign of the times  Gap has been closing a large number its stores around the world  175 North American store closures were announced in 2015  while 53 Old Navy store closures in Japan and 20 international Banana Republic store closures were announced this year   Many analysts are still calling for more store closures to make the chain competitive once again ",2016-08-15,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week-8-15---hd,-dks,-tjx,-wmt,-gps-200147939",200147939
163918,385434,HD,Home Depot  3 Trades Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"Home Depot s  NYSE HD  stock went through a rough patch to start the year  A pullback in January and a bounce followed by a deeper pullback in February led to a higher high  That also completed the bearish Shark harmonic pattern  though  and the stock retraced 50  of the pattern through to mid June 
Since then it has risen back to another new high before a shallower pullback into earnings ahead of Tuesday s U S  open  The Bollinger Bands  are squeezing ahead of the report  often a precursor to a big move  and the momentum indicators are reversing higher  The RSI held the mid line and is rising while the MACD is flat after a pullback and remains in positive territory 
The past 6 reports have seen the stock price move on average 2 73  or about  3 75 at the current price  That would make for a range of about 133 80 to 141 50  The at the money straddle this week suggests a move of about  4 35  Implied volatility is only at 38  compared to longer run volatility at 18  in the September options 
Open interest is large on the put side from the 135 to 133 strikes and then gain at the 130 and 125 strikes  On the call side it is biggest at the 140 strike  but also big at the 130 and 135 strikes  The peaks on the call side are much bigger than the put side as well  Short interest is under 1  on the stock 
For The Long Holder  If you are seeking to protect gains  then a collar is the trade for earnings  An August 137 130 Put Spread   1 60  protects to the large open interest at 130 below  By also selling the September 23 Expiry 142 Call   1 19  the out of pocket cost is reduced to 40 cents and still leaves 3  upside before you need to adjust 
For The Speculator  With the largest open interest at 140 above  a speculator could look for a move higher to that level  Using a August 138 140 Call Spread  90 cents  would give a 2 22 1 reward to risk ratio on a move higher  But also selling the August 134 Put  86 cents  lowers toe cost to near zero  To lower the cost without leverage use a 138 140 142 Call Butterfly  37 cents  
For The Investor Who Missed Out  If you missed the run higher and want to be able to buy it on a dip  then an August 136 133 1 2 Put Spread  free  might work for you  This trade gives downside participation from 136 to a maximum payout of  3 at 133  Below that level you will be put the stock with a basis of 130  So as long as it stays over 130 you win  If the stock rises then it cost you nothing and the trade will expire worthless ",2016-08-15,Gregory W.

163920,385436,HD,Markets Focus On Housing Starts  Building Permits And CPI,opinion,"This morning  we see reports on Housing Starts and Building Permits  as well as the Consumer Price Index  CPI   At first blush  we re seeing numbers in line with expectations  thus  market futures are not being shaken up by the results 
	Housing Starts rose 2 1  in July to an annualized rate of 1 21 million  whereas 1 18 million had been expected  We continue to see a drop year over year in multi family housing  which had been the growth driver in previous quarters   Single family housing remains down roughly 25  from the historical average  we see no pop in this segment from July 
	Building Permits dipped 0 1  to 1 152 million  which is slightly below estimates  This follows improved builder confidence reported yesterday  although it should be pointed out this has to do with the higher cost end of the market  entry level housing growth remained elusive in July 
	CPI for July was expected to be unchanged  and that s exactly what was delivered  UNCHED  Minus food and energy costs  this figure bumps to  0 1    0 2  was expected   Year over year  CPI is up 2 2  ex food   energy  marking the 9th straight month with a consumer price index at 2  or higher  Inflation wise  it s tough to demonstrate steadiness more clearly 
	As mentioned  we haven t seen market futures much affected by these results   currently  the Dow looks to open down 44 points  the Nasdaq  10 25 and the S P 500  5  Overnight we saw markets down slightly across Europe between 0 38 and 0 87

163922,385438,HD,4 Stocks To Watch Before The Market Opens On Tuesday,opinion,"Home Depot  NYSE HD   The broader recovery in the housing market and focus on improving customer engagement have been key to Home Depot s recent winning streak  The home improvement retailer has outperformed the Estimize consensus in each of the past 3 quarters and counting  With new and existing home sales making further strides  don t expect a disappointment report later today  An improved housing environment can largely be attributed to low interest rates  As both the number of homes sold increases  and home prices stay high  that will continue to drive traffic to Home Depot stores  Strong job growth hasn t hurt either  allowing consumers to spend on home improvement projects 
Dick s Sporting Goods  NYSE DKS   Despite soft earnings growth  shares are up 55  year to date  A large portion of that comes from the Sports Authority bankruptcy and asset liquidation  In late June  Dick s won an auction to buy the rights to the Sports Authority brand name and intellectual property for  15 billion  For an extra  8 million  Dick s acquired 31 Sports Authority leases  complimenting its current expansion plans  Between opening new physical stores and boosting its omni channel capabilities  Dick s believes its well equipped for future growth

Consumer Discretionary   Specialty Retail   Reports August 16  Before Market Opens
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 98 on  26 49 billion in revenue  2 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  100 million on the top
The ongoing housing recovery coupled with several strategic initiatives have put Home Depot on the path to success
Shares are up 17  in the past 12 months but have fared poorly since the start of 2016
Home Depot is prepared to announce its second quarter results early tomorrow morning  The home improvement retailer has outperformed the Estimize consensus in each of the past 3 quarters  That streak extends to 8 consecutive quarters when compared to Wall Street s expectations  The broader recovery in the housing market and focus on improving customer experience have been key to Home Depot s recent streak  With new and existing home sales making further strides  don t expect earnings to falter in the upcoming report 
Analysts at Estimize are looking for earnings per share of  1 98  15  higher than the same period last year  That estimate has increased by 1  in the past month  Revenue is anticipated to come in 6  greater at  26 49 billion  consistent with the high single digit growth of the last 2 years  Investors should expect to see a small pop after the company reports  Typically the stock increases 2  immediately following a report  Shares of Home Depot are currently up 17  in the past 12 months  but haven t fared as well in 2016 

Low interest rates can be largely credited with the broader housing recovery since the financial crisis  As home sales steadily improve that will continue to drive traffic trends  Not only does Home Depot benefit from an increase in new home sales  but as home prices stay high  consumers tend to invest heavily into their properties  Strong job growth has also supported this ongoing trend  allowing consumers to spend on home improvement projects 
Home Depot is also putting forward strategic initiatives to drive sales  In response to the evolving retail environment  Home Depot is diligently devoting resources to its ecommerce platform  Last quarter online sales growth topped 21   consistent with the double digit gains in previous quarters  A majority of online sales are typically picked up in stores which promote in store sales 
As a retailer  Home Depot still faces significant risks in terms of competition and deeper penetration from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Lowe s is likely the company s largest threat but is still well behind them in terms of market share

163924,385440,HD,Dick s Sporting Goods  DKS  Stock Soars 8  On Strong Earnings  What s Next ,opinion,"Shares of Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS   were up as high as 8  in morning trading Tuesday after the company  better than expected Q2 earnings 
Based in Coraopolis  PA  DKS is a sporting goods retailer that is present primarily in the eastern United States  although it has locations across the country  Coming into the earnings report  shares of the company were up 54 5  year to date 
The Results
The company reported its Q2 2016 earnings before market open on Tuesday  posting  0 82 in earnings per share and  1 97 billion in revenue  These beat our Zacks Consensus Estimates of  0 68 and  1 89 billion respectively 
Along with the top and bottom line beats  the company announced that it repurchased  57 million in stock during Q2 and raised its full year 2016 earnings per diluted share guidance to  3 05 from  2 90  DKS saw a 2 8  increase in consolidated same store sales during Q2  compared to the company s guidance of between  4  and  1  
Furthermore  the company plans to open approximately 36 new stores and relocate nine stores in 2016  the majority of which is expected to occur in Q3 
DKS reported alongside TJX Co    NYSE TJX   and Home Depot Inc    NYSE HD    both of which also beat earnings expectations 
Moving Forward
Although the retail industry as a whole has seen difficulty in recent times due to currency headwinds and shifting consume behavior  DKS is now coming off of its second straight earnings beat  It plans to convert some former The Sports Authority  TSA  locations to Dick s Sporting Goods stores  although it has not yet fully determined which leases to extend and which to let expire 
Sports Authority closed all of its 450 locations back in May  As  at the time  this leaves companies like DKS with the potential to capitalize on a larger share of the market  The company has seen numerous positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days  and will likely continue to tick upwards as analysts digest Tuesday s news 
Bottom Line
Although retailers continue to face danger from Amazon Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   and the world of e commerce in general  DKS offers a unique experience  To visit the brick and mortar store and try out that baseball glove or bicycle is something that one cannot do with a click on the computer 
This is a key point  in our piece on why Amazon can t kill brick and mortar stores  As consumers continue to become more health conscious  a company like DKS is poised for further growth  Although investors should certainly remain wary of the many headwinds that retailers face  they should still keep an eye on this company moving forward 
Dick s Sporting Goods currently sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   although this could be subject to change in the days to come

163925,385441,HD,After Q2 Earnings Beat  Should You Buy Home Depot  HD  Stock ,opinion,"This morning  Home Depot   NYSE HD   reported results from its    The home improvement retailer beat earnings estimates by  0 01  posting EPS of  1 97 for the quarter   Along with the bottom line  Home Depot surpassed our sales estimate by a slim margin  and it posted revenues of  26 437 billion   The beats were thin  and the stock lost about 0 64  today  so is Home Depot stock still a buy 
The company is heading in the right direction on the sales front  albeit at a slower pace   According to   same store sales grew at the slowest rate  5 4   in nine quarters   Comparable store sales increased by 6 6  compared to Q2 of 2015  but they still grew at a slower pace compared to the comps growth that the company has experienced over the last 10 quarters   Sales guidance remained consistent  with revenues growth of 6 3  forecasted for this year     
The bottom line  on the other hand  did see improved guidance  with EPS expected to grow 15 6  year over year  up from its previous estimated growth rate of 14 8    Compared to the first half of 2015  HD reported a 15  increase for operating income over the first two quarters of 2016   This is mostly attributable towards higher sales numbers coupled with only 2 6  growth in total operating expenses over that time frame   As gross profits increase  more of those dollars trickle down to the bottom line since operating expenses grow at a slow rate   This makes the stock a very attractive prospect to hold onto for the long run  especially since it has a consistent record of growing sales over time 
Home Depot has delivered massive sales numbers over the years  and this has helped it to become a cash flow giant   The company has shown dedication towards delivering returns to shareholders through dedicating billions of dollars towards share buy backs every year   The home improvement retailer has also done well in increasing its quarterly dividend every year for over 7 years   The stock currently yields about 2   which isn t exactly impressive  but because of the stock s strong free cash flows generated  it stands to keep increasing its cash payout per share significantly in the years to come    
Home depot definitely looks like a worthy buy for the long run  but there s reason to bet on the stock in the short term as well   Home Depot stands to benefit from the bullish housing market  and this industry has a strong relationship with sales in the home improvement market   Existing home sales are up 5  year over year in the first half of 2016  and if the pace does pick up  it is possible that Home Depot will benefit from this trend HOME DEPOT Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Furthermore  HD has consistently topped our EPS consensus estimate for several straight quarters  and this part of why the stock has kept going up over the last half a decade   Pay attention to estimate revisions and rank changes for Home Depot over the near term   Right now  the stock is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

The retail environment is still plagued by challenges including overseas turmoil  yet to recover Chinese economy  fluctuating commodity prices and sluggish traffic  Apart from this  colder than normal weather in the significant spring selling season largely impacted second quarter comparable store sales through May  However  it is said that change is the only thing constant and we believe that the sector is positioned to gain from the improving U S  economy 
Retail Sector Still Holds the Baton   Why

These factors  along with improved U S  consumer spending usher in confidence about this earnings season for the Retail Wholesale sector  So  let s take a quick look at how the earnings trend has actually unveiled so far  per our  report published on Aug 5  2016

163982,385498,HD,Improve Your Portfolio With Home Depot,opinion,"The Home Depot  NYSE HD  is where you go for all those projects around the home  Whether it is painting  building a life size playhouse  creating a patio or enhancing your lawn  They have what you need  But most people would not think to go to Home Depot to spruce up their investment portfolio  Why not 
The stock of Home Depot has been a great place to put money to build a new portfolio  The price started to move higher out of consolidation in August of 2014  It rose through to January 2015 before a pause and a rounding up to a new leg higher  That made another high in November 2015 
It succumbed to the market forces in January and February  pulling back  but recovered to a new all time high again in May  the height of the DIY season  It did pullback again to a higher low in June before the latest reversal higher 

The chart above shows the price action from December through to the May high traced out a bearish Shark harmonic  It reversed lower at the second Potential Reversal Zone  PRZ  and retraced 50  of the pattern  This is where the last leg higher began  Sticking with the harmonics  this gives an AB CD target to 151 75 at the end of September 
The momentum indicators support a continued move higher  The RSI has held in the bullish zone  over 40 on every pullback and is rising  The MACD is rising and positive as well  It is also about to cross up  a buy signal  Price confirmation will come on a move over  B   the all time high  That is when you can stick it in your portfolio for a move higher

164003,385519,HD,The Unrelenting  Unforgiving  Treasury Trade,opinion," Sometimes it is good to have reminders of the mistakes you ve made     Brian Bosworth   The Boz   ESPN s 30 for 30
If there is one trade that I haven t done a good job of for clients off the  09 low  it has been trying to anticipate rising interest rates and sitting on too much cash within the fixed income allocations of balanced accounts 
The unrelenting  unforgiving  unrepentant punishment of the Treasury bull market trade has hurt  and now looking at the two attached charts the 10 Year Treasury yield is poised to trade below its July  2012 low of 1 39  
On this  monthly  chart  which is a graphic display of the CBOE 10 year Treasury Yield Index the 10 year yield is not yet as oversold as its was in July  2012 

On this  weekly  chart of the same contract   the CBOE 10 year Treasury yield index   the 10 Year Treasury yield is now getting as oversold as it was in early  2015 and again in July  2012 

In the late 1990s its wasn t just the tech bubble that was the issue  it was the complete dominance of large cap growth that basically left everything in the dust in its path to the March  2000 high  People forget Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  traded to  70  and Home Depot  NYSE HD  traded from  10 in 1995 to  69 75 by early 2000  only to fall back to the low  20s within the next few years 
Like The Boz quote at the top of the page  to buy Treasuries here leaves me with the distinct feeling that I m repeating the past mistakes of the 1990s  chasing a return on an asset class which has all the hallmarks of JDS Uniphase  NASDAQ VIAV  in 2000   JDSU  now VIAV  was trading at  5 per share in 1995  and eventually peaked at  700 in March of 2000  
And yet  The 10 year Treasury yield could trade to a 1  yield as Scott Minerd  the CIO of Guggenheim and E  Gary Schilling  the long time bond bull  each think it can  But here is the catch  or the fly in the ointment so to speak  now  everyone  is bullish Treasuries 
Back in the early 2000s really 2003 after the start of the 2nd Gulf War and the recovery in large cap stocks after the Technology and large cap growth collapse  the sentiment at that time was that Treasury rates would rise rapidly  CNBC s Rick Santelli used to give the  JP Morgan Bond portfolio manager duration survey  results every Tuesday morning from the floor of the CME  and the results would be 90    95   bearish  Treasuries  i e  higher rates  and a far lower percentage as bullish 
This went on from 2003 pretty consistently through 2006  and the popular sentiment was ultimately wrong  and not just wrong  but very wrong 
From early 2003 to mid 2006 the bearish crowd was right for a while  as the 10 year Treasury yield ultimately peaked at 5 24  in mid June 2006  But of course  very few at the time knew what lay ahead of us in late 2007  2008 
So what is my point 
The point is that with Brexit  the weak May  16 payroll number  the weaker GDP data  the Treasury bulls  lower yield and higher price  seem to once again outnumber the bears 
Conclusion  The 10 year Treasury yield closed at 1 47  on Friday  July 1 so watch the 10 year Treasury yield low of 1 39  from July  2012  Very few people remember that what precipitated the July  2012  low yield was the worry that Greece would leave the EU and the euro and return to the drachma  The Greeks held a vote around the time of the 10 year trade to 1 39    and even though a more radical party to the left of Tsipris and Varoufakis campaigned hard pre referendum  the Greek s chose to stay in the EU  and chose austerity   This was a very different vote from Brexit  The issues were polar opposites  
Could a double bottom in Treasury yields be forming in the 10 year  Treasury sentiment  to me  anyway  seems resolutely bullish once again  looking for lower yields  and it is hard to say that the bullish prognosticators will be wrong 
Once thing I ve never forgotten from Money   Banking and the Bond Management courses I took was  real returns  on Treasuries  Even the most conservative inflation measure today puts the 10 year Treasury  under water  from a inflation adjusted return perspective  meaning that investors in Treasury s between 0 10 years are losing money  when adjusted for inflation   Not that  inflation adjusted  returns matter in Japan or most of Europe  
The June  16 payroll report is Friday  July 8th  Consensus seems to be 170 000 190 000 for both overall and private sector job growth 
My own opinion is that S P 500 earnings will improve in the 2nd half of 2016  led by Energy and Basic Materials 
If you wonder if stocks can generate decent returns in an economy market where interest rates rise  note that in 2013  the 10 year Treasury yield rose from 2  early in  13 to 3  by late November  early December  13 and the S P 500 returned 32  that year  Financials were also the top performing sector 
If the yield curve steepens in a measured  non dramatic  fashion  the US stock market could perform quite well  My worry is that we see an  interest rate  shock and the 10 year Treasury yield rises rapidly after the Treasury pits in Chicago get spooked  the so called  bond vigilantes   but I ve been worried about that since March  09 without success 
Treasuries comprise 33  of the Barclay s Aggregate  the bond market equivalent of the S P 500  so Treasuries still matter in terms of fixed income portfolio returns  My clients own some ProShares Short 20  Year Treasury ETF  NYSE TBF   unlevered Treasury short   which has been kept on a short leash 
Watch that 1 39   all time low from July  2012  10 year Treasury yield this week  That is our line in the sand

164050,385566,HD,HD  One Of The Best Dividend Stocks For Income Growth,opinion,"Home Depot  NYSE HD  has paid uninterrupted dividends since the late 1980s and is a dividend growth machine 
Since making its first quarterly dividend payment of 0 044 cents per share in 1987  Home Depot s dividend has increased to 69 cents  The quarterly dividend has also more than doubled since 2012 
Home Depot possesses many of the qualities I love to see in a business  It earns a high return on invested capital  generates excellent free cash flow  maintains healthy payout ratios  operates in a slow changing industry  and has created substantial value for shareholders over time 
This is the type of business I like to own in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio  While Home Depot s current dividend yield  2   is too low for some income investors  dividend growth potential is excellent and management expects earnings to continue compounding at a double digit rate over at least the next several years 
Let s take a closer look at this premier long term dividend growth stock Business OverviewHome Depot began operating in 1978  approximately 32 years after Lowe s  NYSE LOW  was founded  Despite its later start date  Home Depot is now the world s biggest home improvement retailer with about  88 billion in annual sales 
The company has more than 2 200 retail stores  Lowe s has over 1 800 locations  and maintains the number one market share position in the U S   Mexico  and Canada 
Home Depot s stores carry around 35 000 items covering a wide variety of building materials  lawn and garden products  and home improvement products  Its online catalog maintains over 1 million products  Online sales represent a little over 5  of Home Depot s total revenue and have about tripled over the last few years 
The majority of the company s customers are do it yourself consumers  who account for roughly 60  of Home Depot s total sales 
Professional contractors  which only account for 3  of Home Depot s total customer base  generate 40  of the company s total sales because they spend much more on projects each year Business AnalysisHome Depot s dominance in the home improvement market primarily stems from its economies of scale  strong brand recognition  valuable real estate locations  supply chain expertise  customer service  and leading breadth of products and services 
As the largest player in the market  Home Depot is the low cost provider and can afford to offer one of the broadest lineups of products and services while investing in in store displays and service staff to help customers get everything they need for their next project 
Home Depot s employee base is another advantage  According to the company s investor day presentation  the average tenure of store managers is over 14 years with Home Depot  and 94  of department supervisors started as sales associates  This helps the company provide more consistent project support to customers shopping in the store 
Home Depot also enhances its customer experience by partnering with suppliers to bring innovative and exclusive items to the market that help customers save time and money  Many suppliers depend heavily on Home Depot and have little bargaining power 
Smaller rivals cannot match Home Depot s offerings  breath of merchandise  brand recognition  customer experience  and price points 
The company s extensive IT systems and supply chain form other competitive advantages  Moving and selling millions of products is almost mind boggling  but Home Depot has developed the extensive know how needed to be a successful retailer 
This is particularly important when it comes to e commerce  The company is focusing on creating a better customer experience  increasing the connection between its stores and website 
Home Depot has been opening massive direct fulfillment centers to meet the needs of online shoppers  and the company was even named Internet Retailer of the Year in 2015 
These investments improve Home Depot s ability to scale and better meet the needs of online shoppers  Smaller rivals with less cash to invest and a smaller store network cannot keep up with Home Depot  If I had to guess  this will cause the market to further consolidate over the next decade 
Finally  with so many different products and a constant need to maintain properties  the home improvement market has simply proven to be resilient and slow changing over the years 
A handful of major players control the majority of this mature market  making it very difficult for new entrants to disrupt the space 
Looking ahead  the company expects to add about  13 billion in total sales between 2016 and 2018 to reach its new three year target of  101 billion in revenue  Management also targets operating margin expansion from 13  to 14 5  and an improvement in return on invested capital from 27  to 35  
If successful  Home Depot s sales will grow close to 5  per year over the next three years while earnings compound at a mid teens clip  Incremental growth will be driven by Home Depot s digital business and push to serve more professional contractors 
Home Depot estimates that its addressable market in the U S  is  550 billion with the home improvement market accounting for  300 billion and services representing  200 billion  Maintenance  repair  and operations account for the remaining  50 billion 
In other words  Home Depot currently has about 15  market share in the U S  and sees room for continued expansion  particularly in services  less than 3  market share   online sales  just over 5  of company wide sales   and business with professional contractors 
Home Depot will likely remain a force for a long time Key RisksOver short periods of time  Home Depot s business is sensitive to U S  GDP and the housing market 
Home prices began rising in 2012 and have since increased nearly 30   according to the Case Shiller Home Price Index  Home prices are still a bit below peak prices  but the wind has been behind Home Depot s back for several years 
Higher home values cause homeowners to view their homes as an investment rather than an expense and have helped housing turnover return to its normalized rate  resulting in higher purchases of goods and services from home improvement retailers 
To this point  Home Depot says that big ticket transactions over  900 in value have grown every quarter since the second quarter of 2011  Home Depot has also more than recovered the  13 billion of sales lost during the last recession 
While an unexpected slowdown in the economy and or housing market would potentially hurt Home Depot s near term earnings  these events have little bearing on the company s long term earnings potential 
The bigger risks facing Home Depot are changing demographics  evolving customer shopping preferences  and potential market saturation 
For the first time ever  more Americans 18 to 34 years old live in their parents  house  32 1   than with a partner in their own home  31 6   
It s difficult to say what impact the Millennial generation s different housing choices will have on the home improvement retail market  particularly if Millenials continue brining the home ownership rate lower 
Another demographic risk could be that the aging population shifts a lot of work from do it yourself customers to professional contractors  However  Home Depot already generates about 40  of its sales from contractors and is positioning itself for this trend by readjusting its organization to have a group dedicated on solving the needs of contractors 
Perhaps the biggest uncertainty facing all brick and mortar retailers is the rise of e commerce and how customers shop  Home Depot has said that close to 60  of customers now start their buying journeys online before they even enter a Home Depot store 
Consumers can now buy virtually any product they desire using just the phone in their pockets   there is no longer as great of a need to visit huge stores to find what you need 
In other words  store size is not quite the advantage that it was 10 years ago  potentially creating opportunity for lower cost internet retailers to begin stealing market share 
Home Depot has long been taking steps to fight off potential e commerce competition  The company s digital business has nearly tripled in the last few years and now accounts for over 5  of total company wide sales 
Home Depot is fortunate to participate in many product categories that are less susceptible to online competition  in my view  Many products sold by home improvement retailers are for unique projects that require a hands on evaluation and some consultation 
For example  a do it yourself remodel project requires the consumer to review paint colors  flooring designs  cabinet options  and more  Figuring out all of the materials needed is also difficult 
Home Depot s online store is a major help and interconnects with its brick and mortar operations  According to Home Depot s 2015 annual report  over 40  of the company s online orders are picked up inside of a Home Depot store 
With more than 2 200 store locations across North America  Home Depot is better able to provide customers with omni channel convenience compared to its smaller rivals 
Home Depot s scale also gives it a leg up in e commerce  The company has three massive direct fulfillment centers across the country that allow it to reach most of its U S  customers in two business days or less when shipping directly to a home or job site 
Once again  smaller rivals cannot afford to make these investments  strengthening Home Depot s hold on the number one market share spot 
Aside from demographics and changing customer preferences  market saturation is probably the biggest risk challenging Home Depot s long term earnings growth trajectory 
It s hard to say how many big box home improvement retailers the country needs  Home Depot s efforts to expand its addressable market into services and MRO markets  e g  its  1 7 billion acquisition of MRO player Interline Brands last year  could be an indication that growth opportunities in traditional home improvement are nearing capacity   especially given its status as the largest player in the market 
Overall  Home Depot doesn t appear to face many critical risks  Its strong brand  massive store base  economies of scale  leading e commerce operations  and valuable real estate will keep it relevant and generating cash for a long time Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  A score of 50 is average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Home Depot s Dividend Safety Score of 74 is excellent and indicates that the company pays one of the safest dividends in the market 
The company s strong safety rating begins with its conservative payout policy  Home Depot targets a dividend payout ratio of 50  of earnings with a goal of increasing its dividend every year 
The company s payout ratio over the last 12 months is 55   essentially in line with management s target  Over a longer period of time  we can see that Home Depot s payout ratio has increased from the mid teens in 2005 to sit closer to 40  in recent years 
A payout ratio of 50  provides a good margin of safety for most businesses  Even if earnings unexpectedly fell by 30   the company s payout ratio would still be below 70  
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Another factor impacting dividend safety is how well a company performed during the last recession  which served as the ultimate stress test for many businesses 
As seen below  Home Depot s sales fell at a mid  to upper single digit rate in fiscal years 2009 and 2010  The housing market obviously performed much worse than that  so Home Depot held up better than one might have expected 
Despite its moderate sales declines  earnings and free cash flow per share each declined by more than 25   Home Depot incurs substantial fixed costs due to the nature of its store base  resulting in operating leverage 
Management held Home Depot s dividend flat during the financial crisis  While the company is sensitive to the economy and housing market  its mix of repair products and services help it endure difficult market environments 
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Return on invested capital is one of the most important financial ratios for dividend investing because it can be a good indicator of business quality  Companies with strong competitive advantages will usually earn high and stable returns  allowing them to compound earnings faster and pay safer dividends 
Home Depot significantly improved its return on invested capital since the housing crash  increasing it from 8  in fiscal year 2009 to 26  last fiscal year  Home Depot is clearly a very efficient and profitable operator Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Free cash flow is another key metric that influences a company s ability to pay a dividend  Free cash flow allows a company to invest and return capital to shareholders without needing the assistance of capital markets 
Home Depot has been nothing short of a free cash flow machine  As seen below  Home Depot s free cash flow has increased from a peak of  2 06 per share at the housing bubble s peak in fiscal year 2007 to a whopping  6 17 per share last fiscal year 
Home Depot s stores generate excellent free cash flow because many of their expenses are fixed  As same store sales increase  expenses do not rise as quickly  In fact  management estimates that the company s expenses will grow at about 50  of Home Depot s sales growth rate over the next few years 
As Home Depot continues to make its stores and supply chain more efficient and new store growth slows  free cash flow should continue rising to support a safe and growing dividend Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Financial leverage is another big factor impacting dividend safety  A company will always make its interest and debt payments before paying a dividend 
Home Depot has close to  21 billion in debt compared to  3 3 billion in cash on its balance sheet  However  the company s excellent profit generation and valuable real estate reduce any debt related fears 
Home Depot s net debt   EBIT  earnings before interest and taxes  ratio is 1 4  which means its total book debt could be retired with cash on hand and just 1 4 years of EBIT  This seems pretty conservative to me given the slow moving nature of the home improvement retail industry 
The company s real estate portfolio is also very valuable and supports the debt load  At the company s most recent investor day  management estimated the value of Home Depot s real estate at  35 billion  easily backing the debt carried by the company 
Home Depot also maintains a strong long term debt rating of single A Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  Home Depot s current dividend payment is extremely safe and supported by the company s reasonable payout ratio  excellent free cash flow generation  high returns on capital  business stability  and manageable balance sheet Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Home Depot s Dividend Growth Score is 88  which suggests that the company has some of the strongest dividend growth potential in the market 
Home Depot has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1987 and increased its dividend every year since 2009 
Management last boosted the company s dividend by 16  in February 2016  marking its seventh consecutive increase to its annual dividend 
Large home improvement retailers have proven to be very reliable dividend growers  For example  Lowe s has raised its dividend for more than 50 straight years and is a member of the dividend aristocrats list 
As seen below  Home Depot has increased its dividend at an annual growth rate of 19  over its last 10 fiscal years  and annual dividend growth has exceeded 20  over more recent time periods Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Going forward  management targets a dividend payout ratio of 50   which is about where the company s payout ratio sits today 
In other words  unless management is willing to increase Home Depot s targeted payout ratio  dividend growth will likely follow earnings growth over the coming years 
Under Home Depot s new three year plan through 2018  management s targets imply annual earnings growth in the mid teens  If I had to guess  Home Depot will continue growing its dividend by at least 10  per year over the next few years ValuationAccording to our database of dividend paying stocks  shares of Home Depot trade at 23 2 times trailing earnings  which is a premium to the dividend stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector  which have a median price to earnings ratio of 19 2 
Home Depot s dividend yield of 2  is about in line with its five year average dividend yield  While earnings growth could be in the mid teens over the next few years under management s strategic plan  I believe long term earnings are more likely to grow at a high single digit rate  Home Depot is already a giant company in a fairly mature company  and
Under my earnings growth assumption  Home Depot appears to offer annual total return potential of 9 11  per year  2  dividend yield plus 7 9  annual earnings growth  
Given my earlier concerns about the mature state of the home improvement retail market  I would prefer to wait for a better entry point on the stock   its current multiple seems a bit high relative to my expectations for long term growth ConclusionFrom a fundamental perspective  there s not much to dislike about Home Depot  The company maintains the largest market share in the home improvement retail industry  benefits from economies of scale  is a supply chain expert  and is positioning itself to remain relevant for years to come by investing aggressively in e commerce 
Home Depot is a prime example of a blue chip dividend stock  Consistent free cash flow generation  time tested operations  a strong brand  healthy payout ratios  and consistent earnings growth all contribute to the company s solid dividend story 
Home Depot is on my watch list for a better entry point and is a high quality company for long term dividend growth investors to keep an eye on ",2016-06-07,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hd:-one-of-the-best-dividend-stocks-for-income-growth-200134548,200134548

164083,385599,HD,4 Stocks To Gain From Weak Jobs Data,opinion,Job additions for May came in at their lowest level in five years  raising questions about the chances of a rate hike for the Fed later this month  This surprisingly poor report comes after several bullish economic indicators had made such a move nearly inevitable Several market watchers are now of the opinion that the Fed will stay away from changing the status quo this month  If data continues to come in weak  sectors benefitting from low interest rates are likely to gain  Picking utilities and stocks related to the real estate sector would be a good option at this time Job Additions PlungeThe U S  economy created a total of only 38 000 jobs in May  significantly lower than the consensus estimate of 203 000  Nonfarm payrolls registered its lowest increase since Sep 2010  The tally was also considerably lower than March s downwardly revised job number of 166 000  The Labor Department also revised jobs additions downward in April by 37 000 Meanwhile  the unemployment rate was 4 7  in May  reaching its lowest level since Nov 2007 and was lower than the consensus estimate of 4 9  and April s rate of 5    Labor force participation rate fell 62 6   as 458 000 individuals quit jobs or gave up job searches  which is the primary reason behind the decline in the unemployment rate Further  the average hourly earnings gained 0 2  or 5 cents in May from the previous month s figure to  25 59 per hour  in line with the consensus estimate  But  it was lower than April s 0 4  increase while year ago gains remained unchanged at 2 5  June s Rate Hike UnlikelyThe report all but put paid to hopes of a rate hike announcement in June  Several federal officials had indicated that they were in favor of a rate hike  Some even went as far as saying that putting off one now would be detrimental for the economy  Last week  the Fed chair had also put her weight behind such a move However  Yellen had maintained a cautious tone regarding the pace of rate hikes and said that if the Fed  were to raise interest rates too steeply  and  were to contribute to a downturn   then it would have  limited scope for responding  Meanwhile  new threats to the economy are looming on the international horizon  Fears of a Brexit have increased and will only increase as Britain prepares to vote on a referendum on this issue on Jun 23  China s economy also remains a major cause of concern  Chinese stocks declined today ahead of the release of data on forex reserves and trade which are likely to come in below expectations Our Choices The nature of this month s jobs report data means that a rate hike in June can more or less be ruled out  If domestic economic indicators continue to remain weak  especially on the jobs front  a low interest rate regime could remain in place for a considerable period This is an environment where stocks related to real estate thrive  making them a good investment option at this point  Low rates will also be advantageous for utilities since they have large debt servicing obligations  Adding such stocks to your portfolio would make for a smart move  However  choosing winning stocks often becomes a difficult task This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score Spark Energy  Inc   SPKE  is an independent retail energy services company operating in the U S Spark Energy has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a VGM Score of A  The company has expected earnings growth of more than 100  for the current year  The forward price to earnings  P E  ratio for the

	The left hand side chart compares the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates while the right side chart compares the percentage of companies coming out with positive earnings and revenue surprises  As you can see  the growth pace is notably weak relative to the 4 quarter and 12 quarter averages  but positive surprises are tracking above historical periods for the same group of companies  The recent decline in the exchange value of the U S  dollar is helping S P 500 members on the margin as well  but this preponderance of positive surprises is primarily a function of low expectations 
	The chart below shows the proportion of the 483 index members that have beat both EPS and revenue estimates  Even on this metric  positive surprises are more numerous relative to historical periods The Retail Disappointment
	The focus lately has been on the disappointing Retail sector results  with a variety of traditional brick and mortar operators coming short of already low estimates  We saw this with Macy s    and the other department stores earlier  with even Target    and Best Buy    seemingly not immune to the trend 
	There is a lot of talk about weak consumer demand in the apparel category  but management teams have failed to come up with any plausible explanation for why that is the case when aggregate consumer spending trends appear to be just fine  The most logical explanation for retailers  woes seems to be their inability to come out with a compelling response to the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN     challenge  While a number of these retailers have come out with so called Omni  and multi channel strategies to address this issue  the ground reality is that they have failed to come out with a compelling alternative to the Amazon offering 
	Let s keep in mind that not all traditional retailers are doing bad   the discounters like Kohl s    and Wal Mart  NYSE WMT     seem to be holding up just fine and Home Depot  NYSE HD     and the other home improvement players are doing great  That said  there is no doubt that most of the traditional retailers are losing out to Amazon 
	With respect to the sector s Q1 scorecard  we now have results from 94 6  of the sector s total market capitalization in the S P 500  Total earnings for these retailers are up  2 4  from the same period last year on  5 4  higher revenues  with 68 4  beating EPS estimates and 50  coming ahead of top line expectations 
	This performance actually compares favorably to what we have seen from the same group of retailers in other recent periods  as the side by side comparison charts blow show 


	As you can see  the Q1 earnings and revenue growth pace is only modestly below the 4  and 12 quarter averages  while the proportion of retailers coming out with positive EPS and revenue surprises is actually materially better relative to those historical periods  The more numerous positive surprises from the Retail sector appear to be a continuation of what we have been seeing from other sectors this earnings season  a reflection of low estimates 
	The decent looking growth pace in Q1  however  is a reflection of strong results at Amazon  Once we exclude Amazon from the Retail sector results  the comparisons start looking decidedly unfavorable  The side by side charts below compare the Retail sector s earnings and revenue growth rates  with and without Amazon 
	The recent underperformance of retail stocks is mostly because of tepid guidance for the current period instead of soft Q1 results  You can see the impact of guidance on how Q2 earnings growth expectations for the sector have evolved over the last few weeks  as the chart below shows Earnings Picture Beyond 2016 Q1
	Our summary take on the Q1 earnings season is that while growth remained nonexistent  actual results turned out to be less bad relative to the low levels to which estimates had fallen ahead of this reporting cycle  More companies came out with positive surprises for both earnings as well as revenues 
	Importantly  while estimates for the current period  2016 Q2  have come down  they haven t fallen as much as was the case at the comparable stage in the prior earnings season  Low expectations likely explain part of the deceleration in the negative revisions pace for Q2 as estimates for this period had already come down over the last four months  The recent favorable movement in the U S  dollar s exchange value is likely helping matters on the margin as well 
	Total earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to be down  6 1  from the same period last year  The chart below shows Q2 earnings growth expectations have evolved over the last few weeks 
	The chart below shows Q1 growth expectations contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding three quarters and estimates for the following four periods  Full year 2016 earnings growth expectations have now turned negative  similar to what we saw last year 


	Many see the Q1 earnings season as the inflection point for corporate earnings  with the growth picture starting improve from Q2 onwards and turning positive in the back half of the year  The relative more numerous positive surprises and the fewer negative revisions to current period estimates would support that view  But the proof of this narrative will become clear in the coming days as more companies report Q1 results and provide color on the evolving business picture

164105,385621,HD,Home Depot   Lowe s  Best Retail Stocks For Your Portfolio ,opinion,Spring time brings with it the fervor to renovate remodel homes as well as pick up gardening gear  Here  the role of Home Improvement retailers like The Home Depot Inc    NYSE HD   and Lowe s Companies Inc    NYSE LOW   begins as they are one stop shops for the do it yourself  DIY  projects Here  we must point out the impact that digitization has left on every aspect of retailing  with the home improvement sector being no exception  Though home improvement brands and retailers were not keen on ecommerce in the initial phase of the digital revolution  the advancement in technology and shifting consumer behavior gradually changed the scenario Today  home improvement retailers are steadfastly developing their interconnected capabilities as they believe that in the evolved retail space both digital and physical stores go hand in hand  However  the role of ecommerce for home improvement retailers varies largely from that of other department or apparel store retailers In comparison  we note that online stores are almost replacing department apparel stores as consumers prefer to shop for their clothing  beauty  footwear and even grocery needs online than stepping out  However  this is not the case for home improvement stores as homeowners use the digital channels to research  accumulate information and plan their shopping phases  Even today  digital transactions or ecommerce remains a small percentage of home improvement sales Even as the role of ecommerce for home improvement widens  it is noted that the purchases made online are mostly picked up from stores and consumers generally end up buying more from the store on their pickup visits  The growth of interconnected capabilities in home improvement becomes more apparent as we see Home Depot  a leading home improvement retailer  constantly invest in content  develop its website and improve mobile experience to provide better customer experience  The company recorded a 21 5  increase in online sales and double digit online traffic growth in the first quarter Further  the company s interconnected strategy goes beyond the dot com investment as it continues to invest in fulfillment options to cater to customer demand  One such option is the new customer order management system  COM   which will be fully rolled out in its U S  stores by year end 2016  Not only this  the company has launched the Buy Online Deliver From Store  BODFS  capability  which will enhance the delivery process No doubt  the home improvement stores remain more advantageously placed in this evolving world  where online sales have gulped the physical existence of department apparel stores  We believe  even in the future  this scenario won t change much as buying the latest shirt or smartphone online is easier than deciding on gear meant for home and garden  Additionally  home and garden needs are generally not on top of consumers  minds while they make online purchases That said  we will discuss a couple of home improvement stocks that can fit your portfolio Let s start with the industry leader  Home Depot  which carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and delivered better than expected top and bottom lines for first quarter fiscal 2016  Adjusted earnings of  1 44 per share increased 19  from the year ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 33  while sales advanced 9  to  22 762 million from the year ago quarter  Results benefited from the company s focus on improving customer experience  solid execution and broad based growth across the store  alongside consistent housing market recovery Following a strong quarter  the company raised its sales  comps and earnings forecasts for fiscal 2016  Consequently  the company s estimates moved up  Additionally  the world s largest home improvement retailer has been reporting strong financial statistics since 2008  with steady improvement in revenue  EPS and net income  The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 4 2  in the trailing four quarters   Read more   Next  Lowe s   the biggest competitor of Home Depot   also reported an earnings beat for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and holds a Zacks Rank  2  The company s earnings increased 24 3  year over year to 87 cents and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents  Total revenue rose 7 8  year over year to  15 234 million  The company s sales gained from its efforts to provide a better omni channel customer experience  with strength in both indoor and outdoor categories  Also  Lowe s provided a robust guidance for fiscal 2016 that led to an upside in estimates  Moreover  the company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 0 6  in the trailing four quarters   Read more   With this  it is apparent that the home improvement stocks discussed above hold the potential to bring solid returns to investors when the other department apparel retailers are struggling to hold their market share ,2016-05-25,Zacks Investment

 By Ryan Vlastelica
 NEW YORK  March 29  Reuters    U S  stock index futures
pointed to a slightly higher open on Tuesday as many investors 
cautious about global crises  bided their time before the
quarter s end 
 The S P 500 index has risen 4 2 percent in the first
quarter  While Japan s nuclear power problems and the civil
unrest in the Middle East and North Africa continued  many
investors chose not to risk their gains  The trading volume in
Monday s session was the lowest of the year 
  We re in a wait and see game as we finish up the quarter 
which has been fairly strong   said Jeffrey Friedman  senior
market strategist at Lind Waldock in Chicago   Some people are
taking their cues from the volume  which shows that a lot of
people prefer to stay on the sidelines  
 In one sign of the spillover from overseas events 
oilfield services company Halliburton Co late Monday said its
quarterly earnings were hurt in part by turmoil in
oil producing regions  The stock slid 1 2 percent to  47 34 in
premarket trading 
 Dow component Home Depot Inc late Monday said it would buy
back  1 billion of outstanding shares through an accelerated
program  Shares rose 1 3 percent to  37 12 in before the bell 
 U S  single family home prices fell for the seventh
straight month in January  according to the S P Case Shiller
composite index of 20 metropolitan areas  However  the drop was
not as much as expected  and stock futures showed little
impact 
 S P 500 futures rose 3 2 points but were even with fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures added 31 points
and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1 75 points 
 Lennar Corp rose 2 1 percent to  19 34 before the bell
after the homebuilder swung to profit in the first quarter 
McCormick   Co reported a first quarter profit that beat
expectations

164130,385646,HD,Is Home Depot s Strong Quarter A Good Sign For Lowe s ,opinion,"Lowe s Companies Inc  NYSE LOW  Consumer Discretionary   Specialty Retail   Reports May 18  Before Market Opens
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings of 85 cents per share on  14 84 billion  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  20 million on the top
Lowe s    continues to make strategic acquisitions to further its stance as a leader in home improvement merchandise
The company recently took over 12 former Target Canada locations due to the success they have seen in throughout the country
Home improvement retailer  Lowe s  is scheduled to report first quarter earnings Wednesday  before the market opens  Earnings of late have been right in line with expectations  and this quarter should be no different 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings of 85 cents per share on  14 84 billion  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  20 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier  this projects as a 21  increase in earnings with sales expected to grow by 5  
On average  the stock is a positive mover during earnings season  In the 30 days prior to a report  shares typically increase 3  and continue to increase until the 30 days following its report  Shares are now up 17 4  in the past 3 months 

Improving employment numbers coupled with the housing market recovery has panned out favorably for Lowe s  Last quarter delivered a 5 2  increase in comparable store sales  with positive gains across all product categories 
Meanwhile  the home retailer is making sound progress in its international expansion  The company s Canadian business continues to post strong comp growth and recently took over 12 former Target locations across the country  Additionally  Lowe s recently acquired Canadian based home and garden company  RONA  to help further its position in Canada 
Lowe s is benefiting from its strategic acquisitions  all of which present a significant opportunity in the home improvement space  That said  Lowe s still plays second fiddle to Home Depot  NYSE HD   which posses a majority of the market share in this space

164131,385647,HD,Making Sense Of Retail s Disappointing Q1 Showing ,opinion,"The following is an excerpt from this week s Earnings Trends piece   To access the full artilce   
	The focus lately has been on the disappointing Retail sector results  with a variety of traditional brick and mortar operators coming short of already low estimates  We saw this with Macy s    and the other department stores and even Target    didn t seem to be immune to the trend 
	There is a lot of talk about weak consumer demand in the apparel category  but management teams have failed to come up with any plausible explanation for why that is the case when aggregate consumer spending trends appear to be just fine 
	The most logical explanation for retailers  woes seems to be their inability to come out with a compelling response to the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN     challenge  While a number of these retailers have come out with so called Omni  and multi channel strategies to address this issue  the ground reality is that they have failed to come out with a compelling alternative to the Amazon offering 
	Let s keep in mind that not all traditional retailers are doing poorly   discounters like Kohl s    seem to be holding up just fine and Home Depot  NYSE HD     and the other home improvement players are doing great  That said  there is no doubt that most of the traditional retailers are losing out to Amazon 
	With respect to the sector s Q1 scorecard  we now have results from 78 4  of the sector s total market capitalization in the S P 500  Total earnings for these retailers are up  6 6  from the same period last year on  8 2  higher revenues  with 79 3  beating EPS estimates and 55 2  coming ahead of top line expectations 
	This performance actually compares favorably to what we have seen from the same group of retailers in other recent periods  as the side by side comparison charts blow show 
	As you can see  the Q1 earnings and revenue growth pace is about in line with the 4  and 12 quarter averages  while the proportion of retailers coming out with positive EPS and revenue surprises is actually materially better relative to those historical periods  The more numerous positive surprises from the Retail sector appear to be a continuation of what we have been seeing from other sectors this earnings season  a reflection of low estimates 
	The neutral looking growth pace in Q1  however  is a reflection of strong Q1 results at Amazon  Once we exclude Amazon from the Retail sector results  the comparisons stop looking neutral and start looking decidedly unfavorable  The side by side charts below compare the Retail sector s earnings and revenue growth rates  with and without Amazon 
	A lot of the sector s recent pain is mostly because of tepid guidance for the current period instead of soft Q1 results  You can see the impact of guidance on how Q2 earnings growth expectations for the sector have evolved over the last few weeks  as the chart below shows Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard
	Retail aside  the Q1 earnings season is now effectively behind us  with results from 466 S P 500 members already out  Total earnings for these 466 index members are down  7 0  from the same period last year on  1 2  lower revenues  with 71 5  beating EPS estimates and 55 6  coming ahead of top line expectations 
	The side by side charts below put the Q1 results far from the 466 S P 500 members in a historical context 
	The left hand side chart compares the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates while the right side chart compares the percentage of companies coming out with positive earnings and revenue surprises  As you can see  the growth pace is notably weak relative to the 4 quarter and 12 quarter averages  but positive surprises are tracking above historical periods for the same group of companies  The recent decline in the exchange value of the U S  dollar is helping S P 500 members on the margin as well  but this preponderance of positive surprises is primarily a function of low expectations 
	The chart below shows the proportion of the 466 index members that have beat both EPS and revenue estimates  Even on this metric  positive surprises are more numerous relative to historical periods

164132,385648,HD,Home Depot  HD  Vs  Lowe s  LOW   Which Is The Better Stock ,opinion,"The US Commerce Department announced positive news for the housing market yesterday  stating that housing starts climbed 6 6  in April   This represents a seasonal adjusted annual rate of 1 17 million units added  
The news bodes well for corporations tied to the housing market  such as home improvement companies   Now could be a great time to load up on some reliable stocks from this segment  so which one will bring the most profits to your portfolio 
Home Depot   NYSE HD   and Lowe s   NYSE LOW   are some of the largest competitors in the home improvement sector   Within the last week  both companies reported earnings beats on our consensus estimate  and they have seen their share prices move higher as a result   Which stock is better though   Below  we compare value  growth  and earnings related metrics to decide which company makes for a better investment choice right now 
Lowe s Companies Inc 
Lowe s specializes in offering products and services for home improvement  home decor  home maintenance  home repair  and remodeling and maintenance of commercial buildings   Lowe s is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   and it has a market capitalization of about  68 billion   The company beat quarterly earnings expectations this morning  posting EPS of  0 87 when our consensus estimated  0 85   This represents a 2 35  beat 
Value
Lowe s stock trades at a forward PE of 19 08  and it also has a PEG of 1 24   This is noteworthy  as the average PEG in the industry is 1 40   LOW has a nice price to sales of just 1 09   When a company s price to sales ratio is below one  the stock may be undervalued   LOW isn t below this threshold  but it is pretty close   The company has a debt to capital of 60 13   which is a little heavy when compared to the industry s average debt to capital of 44 33  
Growth
This year  Lowe s projects earnings and sales growth of 21 81  and 5 69   respectively   While this is great news  LOW s profit margins in general are pretty slim   Its trailing twelve month net margin is under 4 5  
The Home Depot
Home Depot is among the largest home improvement retailers in the world  Home Depot stores cater to do it yourselfers  as well as home improvement  construction and building maintenance professionals   HD has a market capitalization of about  165 2 billion  and it is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    Home Depot beat our quarterly earnings consensus estimate by 7 46  when it reported its earnings yesterday  posting EPS of  1 44  
Home Depot s valuation is somewhat lofty  as it trades at a forward PE of 21 16 and has a PEG of 1 57   HD lags behind Lowe s across both of these metrics   Home Depot s price to sales is 1 76  and it has a debt to capital ratio of 76 78    The company is somewhat leveraged  but it has high quality cash flows to back it up   Home Depot posts significantly higher profit margins than Lowe s  posting net margins of 7 92   
Bottom Line
While Lowe s appears superior to Home Depot valuation wise  HD has LOW beat on the sales and profitability front   Both companies appear to be great investments  and each of these corporations have been spending billions of dollars every year over the last five years to repurchase their own shares   This suggests that the companies are betting on their own performance 
While both stocks look impressive on the cash flows front  we re going to have to give Home Depot the edge in this contest   Home Depot has seen significant sales growth over each of the last five years   Year after year  Home Depot has succeeded in growing its profit margins as well   When a company grows its revenues and margins significantly at the same time  its operating cash flows stand to see a large increase as well   This helps to increase our confidence in Home Depot as a solid investment choice over the long run  
Lowe s  unfortunately  has not proven itself to be as consistent as Home Depot over the years   From fiscal 2015 to 2016  net margins for Lowe s have actually decreased  going from 4 79  to 4 3    Both these companies have seen significant growth in their dividend payouts over the years   Based on income growth though  it looks like Home Depot stands to be able to grow its dividend payout at a faster rate than Lowe s over the long run

The focus lately has been on the disappointing Retail sector results  with a variety of traditional brick and mortar operators coming short of already low estimates  We saw this with Macy s    and the other department stores and even Target    didn t seem to be immune to the trend

164135,385651,HD,Bear Of The Day  Kohls Corp  KSS  ,opinion,"Retail sales trends have been pretty interesting of late  In addition to online shopping at Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   consumers increased their spending at off price retailers like TJ Maxx and home improvement stores like Home Depot  NYSE HD  but reduced their spending sharply at department store chains like Macy s  Kohl s and JC Penney  Kohl s Corp    reported an 87  plunge in profit for the first quarter 
	sending shares tumbling after the report About the Company
	Headquartered in Menomonee Falls  WI  Kohl s operates about 1 200 stores across 49 states and an e commerce site  Their stores are family focused  selling moderately priced apparel  footwear and accessories for women  men and children and home products  The department store chain mainly targets middle class consumers  Falling estimates sent the stock to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Weak Results Reflect Rising Challenges
	Kohl s reported earnings of  0 31 per share for Q1  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 36 by 13 9   Earnings also declined a significant 50  from the prior year quarter due to a drop in sales and lower gross margin 

	Net sales of  3 97 billion also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 12 billion and were also down 3 7  from the prior year quarter Falling Estimates
	Analysts have slashed their estimates for the company after weak results   Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next fiscal year have fallen to  3 92 per share and  4 14 per share from  4 12 and  4 40 respectively  before the results The Bottom Line
	In addition to disappointing consumer spending and mall traffic  the retail space is going through a shift toward online shopping  With tightening labor markets   wage pressure  has also started hurting retailers  The company plans to close 18 underperforming stores this year  It remains to be seen whether retailers like Kohl s will be able to reorganize their operations and improve their profitability going forward 
	Further  the industry is currently ranked 257 out of 265 Zacks industries  bottom 3    suggesting potential underperformance in the short to medium term  There is no Zacks Rank  1 or  2 stock in the industry  It would be better for investors to stay away from this stock and the industry in view of rising challenges

 By Mark Potter
 LONDON  Sept 17  Reuters    Kingfisher  Europe s biggest
home improvements retailer  posted a 35 percent rise in
first half profit  joining a growing list of store groups to
defy analysts  fears while also warning of a slow recovery 
 Kingfisher  which runs market leaders B Q in Britain and
Castorama in France  said on Thursday it had benefitted from
cost cuts  store revamps and supply chain improvements  though
warm weather had also helped boost sales 
 Chief Executive Ian Cheshire said Kingfisher had also made
the most of changing priorities among consumers who are spending
more time at home in the recession and  with little prospect of
moving house  focussing on making it more pleasant to live in 
  We re seeing slightly more adventurous customers   Cheshire
told reporters   Instead of everything being magnolia because
you ve got to flog it  your house  or do a buy to let  we re
seeing designer wallpaper and accent colours  
 Europe s retailers have mostly had a tough time in the
economic downturn  and while there are signs the recession is
over in some countries  there are fears that consumers will hold
back from discretionary spending to rebuild savings 
 British retail sales were flat on the month in August
against expectations for a small rise  with clothing sales
exerting the biggest downward impact  official data showed on
Thursday

 Kingfisher  with 824 stores across eight countries  said it

forecast a  slow  drawn out economic recovery  on Thursday 
while fashion chain Next said on Wednesday trading was likely to
remain tough  even as it beat first half profit forecasts 
 Kingfisher  the world s third biggest home improvements
retailer behind U S  groups Lowe s and Home Depot  said it made
a profit before tax and one off items of 288 million pounds
  474 million  in the six months to Aug  1 
 Sales were up 7 percent to 5 5 billion pounds 
 The stock  which has outperformed the DJ Stoxx European
retail index by 32 percent  was up 1 8 percent at 209 1 pence by
0805 GMT  valuing the firm at about 4 9 billion pounds 
 The British group said last week  after inadvertently
releasing some figures to analysts  that first half profits
would be between 285 million and 290 million pounds  ahead of
analysts  consensus forecast at that time of 268 million 
 
 SELF HELP
 Singer analyst Matthew McEachran was impressed by
Kingfisher s self help initiatives  
  Many of the factors behind this strong performance are
continuing in nature and not necessarily one off or driven by
the seasonal trading conditions   he said  keeping a  buy 
rating on Kingfisher s shares 
 Cheshire said there were signs of a step up in competition
in Britain  but this was being offset by the withdrawal of
capacity from the home improvements market following the demise
or downsizing of groups like MFI and Floors 2 Go  
 Homebase  Britain s second biggest do it yourself chain 
reported a 400 basis point drop in quarterly gross profit
margins last week  raising fears of a price war 
 B Q s gross profit margin rose 100 basis points in the first
half and Cheshire was confident of further improvement in the
second half  although probably not at the same level  
 Kingfisher also said it was rolling out a more limited
revamp of its stores focused on kitchens  bathrooms and
bedrooms  positioning itself to benefit from the demise of
competitors in these categories 
 The firm also said that plans to turn around its loss making
Chinese business remained on track  with 15 of a planned 22
stores now closed and two of a planned 17 downsized  
 Kingfisher kept its interim dividend at 1 925 pence a share 
   1  6079 pounds

164137,385653,HD,Reuters Summit UPDATE 2 U S  moving to boost exports Locke,news,"  Boosting exports will help cut U S  employment
   US risks being left behind by China on energy front
   Obama wants trade deals  ratified  but issues remain
   Commerce moving  very fast  to reform export controls
   US needs to cut patent approval time by one third
 Adds more quotes from interview 
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON  Oct 21  Reuters    The Obama administration has
made increasing U S  exports a key part of its strategy to
reduce unemployment and is moving on several fronts to do that 
Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said on Wednesday 
 In a wide ranging interview  Locke said the size of the
U S  trade deficit was a concern for the Obama administration 
even though it has fallen sharply this year 
 Ahead of a visit to China  Locke said he would press the
Chinese to lower import barriers to U S  goods and protect the
intellectual property rights of U S  firms 
 He shrugged off criticism the government is dragging its
feet on free trade pacts  saying the Obama administration wants
to finalise deals with Colombia  South Korea and Panama 
  The number one indicator that everyone is focusing on is
the unemployment rate     What we can do to help businesses
grow and expand in America is to help them sell their products
and services   Locke said at the Reuters Washington Summit 
 The key to addressing that deficit is to export more American
products and services  not just to China but all around the
world  
 CHINA BOUND
 Later this week Locke will convene the Obama
administration s first ever trade promotion policy coordinating
committee  He and U S  Trade Representative Ron Kirk will then
travel to Hangzhou  China next week for high level talks on
trade and investment concerns 
 The U S  trade deficit with China totaled  143 7 billion in
the first eight months of 2009  down 15 percent from the same
period last year as the U S  recession took a toll on consumer
and business demand 
 It is still the largest trade gap the United States has
with any country and has fallen less than bilateral deficits
with Canada  the European Union  Mexico and Japan 
  Clearly the trade imbalance with China is not healthy and
we need to do everything we can  to address it  Locke said 
adding the ideal situation would for it to be roughly in
balance  with small fluctuations from year to year 
 Locke said he would be pressing the Chinese next week to
lower barriers that hamper U S  companies from participating in
China s fast growing market for clean energy  alternative fuels
and energy efficiency products 
 But he also warned that the United States risked being left
behind by China in those fields if Congress does not pass
climate change legislation 
 While American investors are waiting to find out what
lawmakers will do   China is spending almost  100 billion a
year from the government supporting renewable energy  clean
energy  energy efficiency   Locke said 
  The longer we in the United States take to pass
comprehensive energy legislation  the farther ahead the Chinese
will be   Locke said 
  Locke  a former governor of Washington  also said he would
also deliver a message to the Chinese that it is in their own
economic interest to focus on strong intellectual property
protection 
  As they start to innovate  as they start to invent 
they re not going to want someone else     ripping off those
ideas and products and services   he said 
 In one recent example of the problem  pirated copies of
Microsoft s new operating system  Windows 7  were on sale in
China last week before the legitimate version was even
released  They sold in shops in Shanghai for about  3 a copy   
a fraction of list prices as high as  320 
 PUSH FOR VISA  EXPORT CONTROL REFORMS
 Earlier this week  Republican Senator Charles Grassley said
he gives President Barack Obama  an F  on trade for failing to
push forward on free trade pacts with Colombia  Panama and
South Korea left over from the Bush administration 
 Approving those pacts is part of the administration s plan
for boosting exports  but it is still too early to say when
they would be sent to Congress  Locke said 
  The president does want those agreements ratified but
there are some issues that need to be addressed   Locke said 
 The Obama administration has previously cited concerns
about anti labor violence in Colombia  tax laws in Panama and
non tariff barriers in South Korea 
 Meanwhile  the Commerce Department has embarked on an
initiative aimed at getting more small and medium sized U S 
businesses involved in exports  Locke said 
 It also is working with the other government agencies to
ease restrictions on business visas that make it hard for U S 
companies to make export sales  he said 
 The department is moving  very  very fast  on its proposal
to remove licensing requirements for companies to export
certain dual use goods that have both commercial and military
applications to longtime allies  Locke said 
 He hoped to have proposals submitted by year end and
implement the measure in the beginning of 2010 
  Things that are readily available from Home Depot or Radio
Shack and yet are subject to export controls make no sense   he
added  echoing a longtime U S  business complaint the current
system makes them lose sales to foreign competitors 
 Locke  who oversees a vast department with a number of
agencies  said he was also moving to restructure the U S 
Patent Office to help U S  business compete 
  I find it absolutely unacceptable that it takes almost
three years before a patent application is accepted or rejected
    We need to get that down to less than a year  And that is a
number one focus for us   Locke said

The Estimize consensus on  is calling for earnings per share of  1 35 on  22 15 billion in revenue  2 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  70 million on the top
Home Depot s strategic initiatives to improve customer experience and expand its omni channel capabilities have paid off
The housing recovery has also played a major part in Home Depot strong growth
Home improvement retailer  Home Depot  is scheduled to report first quarter earnings Tuesday  before the market opens  Home Depot is on an upward trajectory of late  and after strong fourth quarter earnings  expectations are high coming into Q1 results  The company issued strong guidance for 2016 with sales expected to be up as much as 6  and comp sales increasing approximately 4 5   leading to an uptrend in estimates  Home Depot s increased focus on omni channel capabilities and merchandise tools coupled with a persistent housing recovery have started to pay off  This quarter should feature similar double digit gains on the bottom line with modest sales growth 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 35 on  22 15 billion in revenue  2 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  70 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier  this reflects a 16  increase in earnings while sales could climb as much as 6   Typically  the stock does well during earnings season which is icing on the cake for shareholders that have seen shares increase 20  in the past 12 months 

The improvements Home Depot has made across the board have all paid off in the form of strong earnings  The company has implemented significant changes in its store operations to make them simpler and more customer friendly  Furthermore  Home Depot has expanded its omni channel capabilities in response to the evolving retail environment  Online sales last quarter grew 23  to nearly  1 25 billion  Nearly 40  of online orders are picked up from stores which creates store sales  To top it all off  Home Depot maintains a strong balance sheet  allowing them to issue generous dividend payments 
That said  it won t all be smooth sailing for Home Depot  US consumers are being choosy with how they spend their hard earned dollars  In the current environment of appreciating home prices  homeowners do tend to invest more in their properties  but a lot of that relies on a stable jobs environment going forward  If wage growth stays as suppressed as it has been  spending on big remodeling projects may be fewer and far between ",2016-05-17,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-home-depot-should-be-in-your-portfolio-ahead-of-earnings-200130244,200130244

  Updates to close 
 By Angela Moon
 NEW YORK  Aug 26  Reuters    Investors stayed cautious on
Wednesday after a rally  leaving stocks little changed despite
solid reports on new home sales and durable goods orders 
 For the third consecutive day  equities bounced after
favorable news  but the gains fizzled 
 After a five month run up that has pushed the broader S P
500 up 52 percent from its 12 year closing low on March 9 
analysts have been questioning the rally s strength even as
economic data points to improved demand 
  It s a sleepy day on Wall Street   said Fred Dickson 
market strategist at D A  Davidson   Co in Lake Oswego 
Oregon 
  It seems like traders have lost the momentum after a huge
upward move and they are finally taking a breather  
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4 23 points  or 0 04
percent  at 9 543 52  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index added
just 0 12 of a point  or 0 01 percent  to 1 028 12  The Nasdaq
Composite Index ended up just 0 20 of a point  or 0 01
percent  at 2 024 43 
 In July  sales of new homes rose at their fastest pace in
10 months  the U S  Commerce Department s data showed  but the
impact on the broader market was muted as some market players

164186,385702,HD,Will Hhgregg  HGG  Pull Off A Surprise In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"hhgregg Inc    NYSE HGG   is set to report its fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results on May 19  Last quarter  this appliance and electronics retailer reported a positive surprise of 19 05  
The company has posted negative surprises in two of the past four quarters and positive surprises in the remaining two  translating to an average negative surprise of 16 51  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
We are encouraged about hhgregg s strategic initiatives  which focus on stabilizing the business by reversing the negative sales trends  optimizing marketing spending and improving the cost structure  These initiatives led to positive EBITDA results in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016  The company remains confident that it will generate positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter as well 
These initiatives are also expected to reduce general and administrative expenses by  30 million in fiscal 2016 
The company also expects to remain focused on expanding its Fine Lines departments within the appliance category  Further  it plans to increase the sale of larger screen 4K TVs and home theaters  furniture and online sales in fiscal 2016 
hhgregg s cost savings initiatives are also appealing  as it has generated  48 9 million of savings in the first nine months of fiscal 2016  This signals that the company will be able to exceed its target of  50 million of cost savings in fiscal 2016 
However  we note that hhgregg has been reporting losses and declining revenues for many quarters  primarily due to weak comparable store sales  The company has been witnessing sluggishness in same store sales of the consumer electronics segment and computers and tablets category  The company s home products category and appliance category have also remained weak 
Though hhgregg s strategic initiatives have the potential to revive declining comps  we believe the improvement will take time as the company is still under a lot of pressure and facing volatility  Moreover  hhgregg had earlier expected negative mid single digit comps for this year 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that hhgregg is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for hhgregg is 0 00  as the Most Accurate Estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 30 cents 
Zacks Rank  hhgregg s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a positive surprise 
We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 and  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Stocks in the retail sector that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank and are therefore worth considering include 
Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY    with an Earnings ESP of  2 94  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   closed at 66 8   a mere stone s throw from overbought status  above 70    T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  jumped up to 59 3   Together  these indicators helped confirm the bullish move of the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   which gained 1 3  and confirmed 50DMA support 

T2108 jumps back toward overbought territory


T2107 looks ready to re establish its primary uptrend 


The S P 500  SPY  prints a solid gain that confirms the 50DMA as support 

The rally day delivered a strong 1 3  gain to the NASDAQ  PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ    This third day of gains positioned the tech heavy index for a test of MAJOR resistance converging at its 20  50 AND 200DMAs  This is a critical test as a breakout would confirm a return of advantage to the buyers 

The NASDAQ  QQQ  is working on reversing a major technical breakdown 

The volatility index  the VIX  fell from the 15 35 pivot and closed just above recent lows  This move demonstrates the power of buyers but also puts the VIX back in an area from which it has tended to bounce 

The volatility index drops 6 5  toward recent lows 
This rally caught me a bit off guard  Technically  I should have bought the open for the S P 500 given the apparent confirmation of 50DMA support  However  my short term trading call was  cautiously bearish   so I was watching for a fresh breakdown of support instead 
I felt better after watching Tuesday s segment for Nightly Business Report  NBR  where Dominic Chu reported that floor traders were baffled by the day s rally  Of course  he and the producers did consult the charts which provided a potentially simple answer  Chu tossed oil into the ring just because it is a usual suspect  Traders reached for a narrative resting on a slightly better than expected earnings season 
The most interesting and perhaps compelling reach for an answer  McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   and Home Depot  NYSE HD   These three stocks that all hit new all time highs  are major components of the Dow Industrials  SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average  NYSE DIA   AND sport yields higher than the 2  offered by 10 year Treasuries  Yep  THAT is how hard it was to find a good headline to explain today s rally 
Maybe a bounce from support is explanation enough  You can see the segment called the    around the 5 00 mark in the video below 

I now turn to my favorite explanations  the stock charts 
I start with JP Morgan Chase  NYSE JPM  since the rally off February lows marked  the JPM bottom   JPM broke out above 200DMA resistance after last month s earnings only to fall back down again  Last Friday  JPM survived a test of 50DMA support and looks energized enough for another 200DMA breakout  Note well that the stock is clinging to post earnings gains which started with a breakout from previous consolidation 
In other words  this is a decent spot to buy into a sustained breakout for JPM assuming the buyers are indeed back in the market 

JP Morgan Chase  JPM  is fighting to resume post earnings momentum 

Materials and commodity related stocks were hit hard the previous two days  Many of them became darlings in Tuesday s rally  United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X  printed a bottoming hammer right at its 50DMA support which now also happens to coincide with the 2009 intraday low  that line held tough as resistance for much of March  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  came roaring back from Monday s loss to print a bounce off what now looks like 200DMA support  for now  
U S Steel  X  clings to breakout territory with a hammer right at support 


Caterpillar  CAT  tries to hold onto 200DMA support even as memories of a 50DMA breakdown remain fresh 
The Australian dollar  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar  NYSE FXA   versus the Japanese yen  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Japanese Yen  NYSE FXY   has supported the rally with its own gains  However  at the time of writing  AUD JPY looks like it is finally losing steam  This pullback suggests a weak open is coming for Wednesday  I will continue watching AUD JPY for clues on the sustainability of this nascent turn around 
AUD JPY has confirmed the market s turn around but a pullback may signal an end for now 
I am long overdue for an update on Eros International Plc  NYSE EROS   This stock has rebounded nicely from the time of my last post almost 6 months ago  In March  EROS published audit results that presumably cleared its name of previous charges of financial chicanery  The rally that day was faded from the high  and the stock is only just now setting a new high  EROS looks good to test 200DMA resistance now 
The next earnings report is still a month from now  I am hoping EROS can keep chugging along until then irrespective of the market s bear bull signals  Fresh complaints from analysts probably present the biggest potential landmines for the next month or so 

Eros International is breaking out again on good buying volume 

The tides have definitely turned in favor of the buyers  but I am leaving my trading call at  cautiously bearish   If  when   the NASDAQ breaks out from resistance  I will immediately switch to bullish even if T2108 has not yet re entered overbought territory  Re entry into over bought status  accompanied with gains in T2107  make me a bull convert all over again even if the NASDAQ has yet to cooperate by then

164219,385735,HD,Will Wal Mart  WMT  Pull Off A Surprise In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Wal Mart Stores Inc    NYSE WMT   is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017 results  before the opening bell on May 19  Last quarter  this retail giant posted a positive earnings surprise of 2 05  
We note that the company has beaten earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters  missed estimates in one quarter and matched the same in the remaining quarter  making for an average positive surprise of 1 17  

 
 
 
 
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Wal Mart has been delivering positive comps in the U S of late as a result of  lower fuel prices  which eased consumers  spending power  E commerce has also contributed to the company s sales  The company expects the trend of positive comps at Wal Mart U S  to continue in the soon to be reported quarter 
Wal Mart expects U S  comp sales growth of around 50 basis points for the 13 week period ending Apr 29 compared with 1 1  comps growth last year  While lower fuel prices will provide some tailwinds  food deflation  mainly in meat and dairy products will remain a challenge  Sam s Club comp sales  without the impact of fuel sales  are expected to be flat compared with 0 4  growth last year 
However  the Bentonville  AR based company is facing severe challenges and showing signs of acute weakness  Wal Mart expects to incur huge e commerce expenses  In an effort to compete with the biggest online retailer Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN   and to improve customer service  Wal Mart is aggressively investing in its e commerce business  Wal Mart s focus on e commerce will in turn lower profit margin potential  given shipping costs and price competition involved in it 
In addition  Wal Mart is facing intense competition on all fronts  ranging from dollar stores to traditional grocery store chains and online business  Its international operations are also under pressure with a stronger dollar eating into sales  At the same time  Wal Mart projects slower growth in small format Express stores due to price competition from local grocers in some markets 
As a result  the company plans to close 269 stores in the U S and globally  which will affect about 10 000 jobs domestically and will eliminate 6 000 jobs overseas  with a majority of the international impact relating to the closures in Brazil  These store closures will also impact fiscal 2017 net sales growth 
Wal Mart has also pledged to invest  2 7 billion for raising employees  wages and give them extra training in fiscal 2017  Under the initiative  Wal Mart had increased its minimum wage to  9 an hour in April  and to  10 per hour in Feb 2016  The initiative of paying higher wages will further raise the expense burden on the retailer  Higher labor costs along with the company s efforts to overhaul its stores and invest in its online operations will weigh on its earnings 
The company anticipates higher wage investments to hurt the first quarter more on a year over year basis than in subsequent quarters 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2017  earnings are expected in a range of 80 cents to 95 cents per share  compared with the prior year quarter s earnings of  1 03 per share  Currency is expected to negatively impact earnings by 3 cents 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Wal Mart is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   Earnings ESP for Wal Mart is 0 00  as both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate estimate stand at 88 cents 
Zacks Rank  Wal Mart s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a positive surprise 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some consumer staple companies  which are worth considering  as our model shows that they have the right combination of these two elements

 NEW YORK  Aug 17  Reuters    U S  stocks suffered their
worst loss in seven weeks on Monday as weak data from Japan
and a disappointing outlook from retailer Lowe s Cos dampened
hopes about the economy s growth 
 Japan s gross domestic product showed its economy pulled
out of recession in the second quarter  but at a slower pace
than expected  prompting a sell off in major Asian markets
that spilled over into Europe and North America 
 Lowe s stock dropped 10 3 percent as the U S  home
improvement company gave investors few reasons to be positive
about the outlook for the consumer 
 The results amplified worries about weak consumer spending
following last week s poor data on U S  consumer sentiment and
retail sales 
  The GDP number in Japan sort of got things started when
it missed this morning   said Stephen Massocca  managing
director of Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco 
 But  he said  the sell off in China was a big worry 
  A lot of people have seen China as kind of the reason we
rallied to begin with  The Chinese economy was doing so well 
it was leading us out  of the recession   and now that story
is very much in jeorpardy  
 U S  selling was broad based  but shares sensitive to the
economy s cycles fell the most  including industrials  down
2 9 percent  and financials  down 4 3 percent  The Dow Jones
index of home builders  shares fell 3 3 percent 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 186 06 points  or
2 percent  to end at 9 135 34  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
 slid 24 36 points  or 2 43 percent  to 979 73  The Nasdaq
Composite Index lost 54 68 points  or 2 75 percent  to
1 930 84 
 The Dow and the S P 500 had their worst one day percentage
sell offs since July 2  while the Nasdaq had its worst since
June 22  The S P 500  however  is still up about 45 percent
from its early March lows 
 Shares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc fell 4 5
percent to  43 95  leading the Dow s major decliners 
 The health care sector outperformed other groups  with
managed care companies boosted by the view that a public
health care plan was fading  The S P managed health care index
 rose 2 6 percent 
 In the retail sector  Lowe s gave a third quarter earnings
outlook that was below expectations  and said it was slowing
plans for expansion  Chief Executive Robert Niblock said
consumers remain under pressure even though housing is showing
signs of bottoming out  Lowe s stock dropped  2 36 to  20 47 
 Shares of rival Home Depot Inc  a Dow component that is
scheduled to report results on Tuesday  dropped 3 8 percent 
or  1 03  to  26 11 
 Offsetting some of the declines earlier was regional data
from the New York Federal Reserve that showed the state s
factory sector was better than expected in August 
 Volume was light on the New York Stock Exchange  with 1 22
billion shares changing hands  below last year s estimated
daily average of 1 49 billion  while on the Nasdaq  about 1 95
billion shares traded  below last year s daily average of 2 28
billion 
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by
a ratio of 9 to 1  while on the Nasdaq  more than four stocks

164236,385752,HD,Following Up On That ES Break,opinion,"On Tuesday  I wrote this post  which declared that the ES uptrend was broken  Now I want to say two things very clearly at the outset  First off  the last couple of months have been very hard on me  and earlier this week in particular was devastatingly hard from an emotional standpoint  Northy and I were holding onto each other for dear life at times   So I confess I was reaching a bit to look for any  good news  for the bears  which was a motivation behind the post  although I absolutely was sincere about the trendline break  
Second  the comments I m going to share below are in no way meant to disrespect or  call out  the folks replying  because they were said respectfully  and God knows I ve been wrong more often than right in my lifetime   At the time  they did sting a bit  because     let s face it     charting is my life  and if my interpretation of trendlines isn t valid  or if trendlines themselves are pointless   well  I might as well go work in Home Depot  NYSE HD  
Anyway  when I did the post  a couple of comments were   

    and   

But I think what we ve seen transpire helps support the notion I was offering  which was that    the broken trendline does matter  and after about thirty years of being a chartist  I m pretty good at spotting them ",2016-05-01,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/following-up-on-that-break-200126918,200126918

164239,385755,HD,UPDATE 3 Home Depot to cut 7 000 jobs  close Expo chain,news," Adds company  analyst comment  changes dateline  previously
CHICAGO 
 ATLANTA  Jan 26  Reuters    Home Depot Inc said on Monday
it was eliminating 7 000 jobs  or about 2 percent of its
workforce  as the world s largest home improvement retailer
closes its Expo home design centers and cuts corporate support
staff 
 Its shares rose as much as 6 percent after the news 
 Home Depot also said it was freezing officer salaries in a
bid to save money in the recession and prolonged U S  housing
slump 
 The company added it will close other specialty outlets 
including five YardBIRDS stores and a bath remodeling business
known as HD Bath 
 Home Depot opened the Expo stand alone stores in 1991  Even
during the most recent U S  housing boom  it was not a strong
business and weakened significantly as demand waned for
high priced home improvement projects 
 The company said it expects Expo and the other specialty
concepts to post a 2008 operating loss of  50 million  with
that expected to widen to  80 million in 2009 
  For our shareholders and our associates  the benefits of
closing Expo exceed the benefits of continuing to invest in
it   Home Depot Chief Executive Frank Blake said during a
conference call 
 Home Depot initially hoped Expo  a project business that
sells higher end kitchens and baths  would be a growth engine
and at one point had planned as many as 200 Expo stores  But
high fixed costs and weak profitability led to a scale back in
recent years 
  Those stores were marginally profitable even in the boom
years  and one can only imagine what they are doing now when we
are having a massive housing bust   said Paul Larson  a
Morningstar analyst 
 Home Depot s store closures will affect about 34 design
center stores and 5 000 jobs  with another 2 000 posts trimmed
as the company eliminates some administrative staff 
 The company expects pretax charges of about  532 million
from its actions  including  390 million in the fourth quarter 
which ends Feb  1 
 Additional charges are set for the fourth quarter over the
sale of the HD Supply wholesale distribution unit in 2007 and
an ongoing equity interest in it  Those charges will be about
 55 million related to a dispute on working capital and  163
million for a write down of its investment in HD Supply 
 STRATEGY SHIFT
 Blake  who became chairman and CEO in early 2007 after
Robert Nardelli resigned under pressure  has been closing
concept stores and upgrading service and products in Home
Depot s core retail business to win back market share as rival
Lowe s Cos Inc expands 
 Blake eliminated stores including Landscape Supply  which
sold plants and garden products  and flooring stores 
  The company is returning its focus to what it really does
best  the regular big box strip mall type store   Larson said 
 Though officer ranks are being cut 10 percent and their
salaries will be frozen  Home Depot said it would still pay
merit raises and bonuses to its regular employees in a bid to
make its stores desired places to work  The retailer also said
it would keep matching retirement plan contributions 
 For fiscal 2008  which ends next month  Home Depot said it
still expects declines of 8 percent in sales and 24 percent in
per share profit from continuing operations 
 Last year  Home Depot closed 15 underperforming U S  stores
and scrapped plans to open about 50 more that had been in its
new store pipeline  The company said on Monday its current 2009
plans call for no closures of core retail stores 
 Home Depot shares rose 77 cents  or 3 55 percent  to  22 49
in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading  Lowe s shares
were up 60 cents  or 3 percent  at  20 65

LONDON 
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Feb 24  Reuters    Wall Street rose on Tuesday  a
day after U S  stocks slid to a 12 year low  but more signs of
a deteriorating economy and a warning from Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke that the U S  recession could linger
lifted the appeal of low risk assets 
 European stocks fell for a third straight session as fears
persisted about the health of banking stocks and the severity
of the U S  recession  while the U S  dollar touched a
three month high against the yen on a rise in risk aversion 
 Bernanke testified to the Senate Banking Committee in
Congress that the shrinking U S  economy was at further risk
from a self reinforcing cycle of weak growth and financial
market strain  For details  see  ID nN24402092  
 Failure to restore financial stability would likely extend
the U S  recession past this year  Bernanke said  which
bolstered a safe haven bid for the dollar and bonds 
  The implication of a weaker economy in the States has
bigger and deeper implications across the globe   said Brian
Dolan  chief currency strategist at Forex com in Bedminster 
New Jersey   For now  the dollar remains the ultimate
destination for risk aversion   he said 
 Economic reports on Tuesday showed U S  home prices plunged
at a record pace in December and consumer confidence hit a new
low in February 
 But investors shrugged off the data and Bernanke s comments
as they snapped up beaten down shares following a fresh plunge
on Monday  while reassuring results from retailer Home Depot
Inc  helped provide reassurance 
 While the recent sharp falls offered an opportunity to snap
up cheap shares  with financials among the standouts  many
investors remained wary that the worst was over for equities 
  Until the market is convinced that there is a right plan
in place to fix the financial system  it s just going to be
more of the same  There s just no trust   said Peter Cardillo 
chief market economist at Avalon Partners in New York 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 88 89 points  or
1 25 percent  at 7 203 67  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
 rose 11 23 points  or 1 51 percent  at 754 56  The Nasdaq
Composite Index gained 17 75 points  or 1 28 percent  at
1 405 47 
 Pessimism prevailed in Europe where the FTSEurofirst 300
 index of top European shares fell 1 4 percent to end at 719 38
points  closing at its lowest since March 2003 
 The broad STOXX 600 index fell 1 4 percent to 172 86
points  led lower by drug stocks 
  The markets are disenchanted by the policymakers  attempts
to stabilize the financial system   said Mike Lenhoff  chief
strategist and head of research at Brewin Dolphin Securities in
London   They re taking the view that the policymakers are
still struggling  
 Longer dated U S  government debt rose on the rise in risk
aversion  but two year debt was little changed on fears of
growing supply 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note rose 11 32 in
price to yield 2 72 percent  The 30 year U S  Treasury bond
 rose 54 32 in price to yield 3 42 percent 
 Oil climbed toward  39 a barrel as investors took a fresh
look at the greater than expected success by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries in cutting supplies 
 A Reuters calculation based on the consultant s figure
showed OPEC delivered on 89 percent of the agreed supply
cutbacks promised since last year   ID nLN481500 
 U S  light sweet crude oil rose 15 cents to  38 59 a
barrel 
  The OPEC compliance was bigger than expected   said Oliver
Jakob with Petromatrix   Yesterday it was overlooked because of
the meltdown on the Wall Street  
 Bullion accelerated losses after Bernanke said inflation
pressures had receded dramatically as oil and commodity prices
had fallen  and slack had built up in the economy 
 Spot gold prices fell  28 25  or 2 85 percent  to
 964 00 
 Overnight in Asia  shares fell to a three month low and
Japan s Nikkei index flirted with a 26 year low as concerns
grew about the global financial system 
 The Nikkei average  slid 1 5 percent  threatening to breach
levels that would put it at its lowest since 1982  while MSCI s
index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan fell 1 78 percent

164262,385778,HD,Home Depot  HD  Stock Climbs On Strong Sales Volume,opinion,"Home Depot Inc  N HD 
Home Depot is having an incredible day in the market today  and for good reason  The company recently reported earnings  blowing away all expectations and proving strong sales volume  Today  we ll talk about what we saw from the earnings report  how the market reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from HD moving forward  So  let s get right to it 
HD Reports Strong Earnings
As mentioned above  Home Depot reported its earnings for the fourth quarter before the opening bell this morning  and the report proved to be overwhelmingly positive  Here s what we saw 
Earnings Per Share   In terms of earnings per share  HD blew away expectations  While analysts expected that the company would produce  1 10 per share in the fourth quarter  the company actually announced earnings in the amount of  1 17 per share  This also proved to be growth of around 16  year over year 
Revenue   Top line revenue also proved to be a big hit  In the quarter  the company produced revenue in the amount of  21 billion  also proving growth in the double digits 
The Big Story   While beating earnings and producing solid growth in revenue is great news  there s one piece of the earnings report that investors seem to be more excited about than anything else  That is sales growth  In the fourth quarter  the rebound in US homes sales led to massive gains in sales for Home Depot  In fact  HD saw growth in sales in the amount of 9 5  in the quarter 
Looking at the information above  its clear that HD had an incredibly positive quarter  In a statement  Brian Nagel  senior equity research analyst at Oppenheimer   Co  had the following to say with regard to the report 

 The key with Home Depot is that they kept warm weather product in the stores longer  and then as the weather shifted  they got the snow shovels  ice melt  generators  whatever else in their stores quickly  so they were really able to take advantage of what was for a while an odd weather environment  

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we ve learned that the news moves the market  More importantly  we ve learned that few pieces of news have the ability to move the market quite like earnings  When a publicly traded company produces positive earnings  we can expect to see strong gains in the value of the stock associated with that company  So naturally  we re seeing strong gains in the value of HD at the moment  Currently  12 17   the stock is trading at  124 97 after a gain of  2 12 per share or 1 73  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have a relatively mixed opinion of what we can expect to see from HD  First and foremost  earnings in the fourth quarter were incredibly positive  With that said  we can expect to see gains in the short term as investor excitement fuels growth  However  in the long run  things may turn out a bit different  One of the big pushers for HD sales in the quarter were strong new home sales in the US  This figure has been declining as of late  On top of that  HD also benefited from the strange weather in the beginning of he winter  This isn t likely to be the case through the first quarter  So  things will likely get very interesting upon the next earnings release 
What Do You Think 
Where do you think HD is headed moving forward  Let us know your opinion in the comments below ",2016-02-23,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/home-depot-(hd)-stock-climbs-on-strong-sales-volume!-200119278,200119278
164263,385779,HD,Commodities Becoming Currencies  Brexit   EU Big Bank Anxieties Impact,opinion,"Cryptocurrency Might Go Legit in Japan The Guardian  that bitcoin is getting some extra attention in Japan this year  The Liberal Democratic Party  the current governing political party in Japan  has announced that part of the party platform will be the legitimizing of various cryptocurrencies in Japan s legal system  Part of the incentive for this is the ability for Japan s government to tax the currency  but they re also looking to add some extra growth to their economy  If they become one of the first countries to change the legal definition of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin from a  commodity  to a  legal currency   Japan could become the center of regulated cryptocurrency exchange and regulation  sparking investment in the infrastructure required to facilitate exchanges and international monitoring 
European Union Debate in UK Hammers GBP Just as Trump has tapped into anger among the electorate here in the United States  isolationist fervor in the UK is prompting a potential Brexit from the European Union  The UK s Prime Minister  David Cameron  prefers the country remain a member of the EU  but 2 3 of his own conservative party supports parting ways  The impact of a potential Brexit would send shockwaves through forex markets as the pound becomes slightly less stable  Periods of great political transition have a direct impact on the perceived stability of a currency tied to the state in turmoil 
It s expected that the UK will hold a referendum in September of this year to decide whether the country will remain a member of the EU  GBP exchange rates are tremoring already  partly because of international uncertainty  but the national debate over EU standing certainly plays its own role 
Yen Even More Volatile in Shaky Forex Market Bloomberg Business  that the trends in implied volatility for the next three months indicate the yen is even more unstable than the GBP  This is shocking considering the raging debate in the UK over their place in the EU  but understandable considering the fact that the UK s vote on remaining in the EU is beyond the three month horizon of current implied variability figures 
Factors impacting currency exchanges include  expected upcoming damage to GBP associated with the Brexit  big banks causing fear in Europe  oil continuing to slide in price per barrel  and a 10 percent slide in global stock value  China s economy is still hitting the brakes more than the accelerator  and the US economy isn t exactly skyrocketing back into pre recession territory  although it is certainly hobbling its way back to a healthier position 
A Good Morning on the Street On a brighter note  the US economy is continuing on a path to better health  Search trends show that from all online classified ads listings  it is obvious that Americans are searching less for jobs  Such trends correlate to the figures  as unemployment dipped under 5  in January  Amazon  O AMZN  is up  1 10 this morning  partly based on a new marketing campaign by the cloud computing giant to woo banks to utilize their cloud instead of expensive in house infrastructures  Home Depot  N HD  is another winner this morning as it manages to  ",2016-02-28,Faizan Raza,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/commodities-becoming-currencies,-brexit---eu-big-bank-anxieties-impact-200119727",200119727
164264,385780,HD,Bond Trading Gets More Attention As Mortgage Credits Tighten,opinion,"Impact of Tightening Mortgage Lending on the Broader Economy 
When mortgage approval standards tighten  it s a signal that lenders feel the economic outlook might be bleaker than in previous months  If there are challenges up ahead  banks feel that borrowers may be more likely to face rough patches in their financial forecast  As a result  they raise standards for applicants to meet before they make mortgages available to the market 
The more arduous the approval process becomes for Americans seeking a mortgage  the tougher it becomes for companies that build homes and provide services to homeowners to grow and expand  For example  Home Depot  NYSE HD   Lowe s  NYSE LOW  and Ryland Group  RYL  all rely on lenders providing access to capital for homeowners to purchase and then improve their homes 
Mortgage Credit Availability Index  MCAI  down 0 4 Percent in January On February 5  the Mortgage Banker Association  MBA  released the updated figures for January 2015  including the Mortgage Credit Availability Index  MCAI   Unfortunately  just as the stock market got off to a shaky start in the beginning of this year  the mortgage lenders appear to be tightening the availability of funds  The MCAI dropped by 0 4  in January  This follows a 2 4  drop in December  The trend for the past few months is the opposite of what a growing economy needs  credit availability for future homeowners is becoming more challenging 
The average  has also come into focus  For men  this score is just a 630  For women in the US  the average is just 621  A perfect score is 850  A credit score can be impacted by defaulting on debt  making late payments  or using a high percentage of available credit in a revolving account  This score directly impacts a lender s decision to approve or decline a mortgage application 
So far this year  the financial industry is the worst performing sector in the S P 500  per    This is understandable considering the challenges US markets face  oil prices in a freefall  ever increasing trade deficits  and European markets struggling with a looming banking crisis  To adapt to these challenging times  banks are focusing on new opportunities in secured asset trading  i e  bonds  
Banks Scramble to Create Stronger Bond Trading Products Building bond packages that can be marketed via exchange traded funds is becoming a focus of major banking industry titans  According to a  from Reuters  the major banks creating special teams to package and provide exchange traded bond offerings include  Barclays PLC  LON BARC   Credit Suisse Group AG  VX CSGN   and Goldman Sachs Group  NYSE GS   This represents an international shift by banks around the world to meet growing demand for  safer  financial investments 
Trading bonds on the exchange  with a diverse set of bond holdings packaged into a single product  makes bonds more accessible to the average investor  The innovator s dilemma is something the banks are clearly worried about  as they are now in an all out race to provide these high demand investment products to their customers  Whoever can create the best package of bonds and deliver them to the market in a strong index fund will enjoy some fantastic maintenance fees and commissions ",2016-03-02,Faizan Raza,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bond-trading-gets-more-attention-as-mortgage-credit-availability-tighten-200120189,200120189

   Gold  bonds  yen all rise as risk aversion returns
   Oil prices slip to 13 month lows on recession worries
  Adds close of European markets  Bernanke  freshens pricings 
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Oct 15  Reuters    Stocks plunged and oil prices
dove to 13 month lows on Wednesday after a new batch of U S 
economic data rattled investors who increased their aversion to
risk on growing signs of a deeper worldwide slowdown 
 Shorter term U S  and euro zone government debt rose  gold
prices jumped more than 1 percent and the less risky yen gained
after reports on U S  retail sales and manufacturing activity
in New York state intensified fears the U S  economy is in
recession 
 Major European stock indexes closed down more than 7
percent and U S  shares  as measured by the broad S P 500 
dropped more than 5 percent after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke said the U S  economy faces major headwinds 
  By restricting flows of credit to households  businesses 
and state and local governments  the turmoil in financial
markets and the funding pressures on financial firms pose a
significant threat to economic growth   Bernanke said in
remarks to the Economic Club of New York 
 Bernanke said the U S  central bank would continue to act
aggressively to fight the worst financial crisis since the
1930s  But he said credit markets would take time to unfreeze
and that slowing consumer and business spending  along with a
softening labor market  pointed to shaky economic activity 
 U S  economic data released before Bernanke spoke confirmed
his outlook and the fears of investors 
 U S  retailers posted their biggest monthly sales decline
in more than three years in September  while a gauge of New
York manufacturing fell in October to the lowest since its
inception in 2001 
 Shares of big U S  retailers were bruised by the data  with
Dow components Wal Mart Stores   the world s largest
retailer  down 4 6 percent  and Home Depot  slipping 3 4
percent 
 Before 1 p m   the Dow Jones industrial average  was
down 288 48 points  or 3 10 percent  at 9 022 51  The Standard
  Poor s 500 Index  was down 39 53 points  or 3 96
percent  at 958 48  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down
58 89 points  or 3 31 percent  at 1 720 12 
 Exxon Mobil  was among the biggest drags on the Dow 
falling 7 6 percent as crude prices fell more than  3 on fears
of slower economic growth  Economic bellwether Caterpillar Inc
 gave up 7 5 percent 
  It looks like everything that s economically sensitive is
getting hit pretty good   said Scott Vergin  a portfolio
manager at Thrivent Financial in Minneapolis 
  The thing is how much has the credit crunch already
impacted the real economy   Vergin said   That s what
everyone s really worried about  
 The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
closed 6 5 percent lower at 903 67 points 
 Britain s FTSE 100  fell 7 1 percent  Germany s DAX
 slipped 7 1 percent and France s CAC 40  shed
7 2 percent 
 Investors dumped mining shares  with the DJ Stoxx basic
resources index  plummeting 16 percent  tracking a sharp
sell off in commodity prices on recession concerns 
  It s the beginning of the end of the financial crisis  but
beyond that a global recession is looming   said Emmanuel
Morano  head of equity management at La Francaise des
Placements  in Paris 
  Fears over a global recession are justified  and these
fears have been priced in very quickly  Valuations in the basic
resources sector are apocalyptic  This sell off really has the
violence of the crash of 1987  
 Oil prices fell to their lowest level in 13 months  dragged
down by expectations that economic weakness will cut further
into demand for crude 
 Analysts have scaled back global demand growth estimates 
with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
cutting its forecasts for world demand for crude next year in
its latest monthly report   nWLB2749 
  Even if governments are successful in calming equity
markets and unfreezing credit markets in the near future  the
fallout on the real economy from financial market headwinds is
expected to be considerable   OPEC said 
 U S crude  was down  2 85 a barrel at  75 78 after
touching a session low of  74 97  its lowest since September
2007  London Brent crude  was  3 05 down at  71 48 a
barrel 
 In the Treasury bond market  most U S  government debt
prices rose on a renewed safety bid  but longer maturity bond
prices fell as investors worried anew about the huge slew of
debt issuance that looms to pay for the U S  government s
measures to rescue the financial system 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note  rose
4 32 in price to yield 4 07 percent  The 2 year U S  Treasury
note  rose 5 32 in price to yield 1 75 percent 
 The dollar rose against major currencies  with the U S 
Dollar Index  up 0 54 percent at 82 02  Against the yen 
the dollar  fell 0 61 percent at 101 56 
 The euro  fell 0 65 percent at  1 3533 
 Spot gold prices  rose  8 40 to  843 65 an ounce 
 The gloomy economic news and rise in risk aversion came
despite trillions of dollars pledged worldwide to recapitalize
banks and stem the worst financial crisis since the 1930s 
 There were glimpses the concerted government efforts
already were taking effect  The rate banks charge each other
for dollar  euro and sterling loans fell for the second
straight day as recent bold steps from authorities around the
world continued to thaw out frozen money markets 
  Following the release of national  bailout  plans from UK 
Germany  France  U S  and others  there are early signs that
the severe money market tension of the last month may be
easing   said Meyrick Chapman  a strategist at UBS 
  We think the easing will continue   Chapman said

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Oct 15  Reuters    The broad U S  stock market
plunged 9 percent on Wednesday  outpacing steep drops in
Europe  and crude oil dropped to 13 month lows after dismal
U S  retail sales and manufacturing data rattled investors who
bid up safe havens on the growing signs of a deepening
slowdown 
 Shorter term U S  government debt rose  gold prices jumped
more than 1 percent and the less risky yen gained after the
data intensified fears the American economy already is mired in
a recession that will be deeper and longer than first thought 
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U S  economy
faces major headwinds  helping push U S  shares  as measured by
the broad S P 500  down 9 percent and erasing most of Monday s
strong gains  Earlier  major European stock indexes fell almost
7 percent 
 Bernanke said credit market turmoil poses a  significant
threat  to the economy  He also said it will take some time to

 The euro fell to session lows against the U S  dollar and
yen on risk aversion 
 Crude oil futures slid more than 5 percent to drop below

by fears of falling demand in a recession 
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut
its forecasts for world demand for crude next year in its
latest monthly report   nWLB2749 
  Even if governments are successful in calming equity
markets and unfreezing credit markets in the near future  the
fallout on the real economy from financial market headwinds is
expected to be considerable   OPEC said 
 U S  crude  fell  4 09 to settle at  74 54 a barrel 
Crude prices are down almost 50 percent from a record peak of

 London Brent crude  fell  3 73  or 5 percent  to

 Stocks extended their slump further after the Federal
Reserve said in its Beige Book report that economic activity
weakened across the United States in September as businesses
revised capital investments and consumers curtailed spending 
  I think that retail sales spooked investors this morning
and has increased the near term risk of a broad based
recession   said Tom Sowanick  chief investment officer at
Clearbrook Financial LLC in Princeton  New Jersey 
 The Fed s Beige Book report  was horrible except for the
housing sector  which appears to be stabilizing in some
districts     Otherwise  the Beige Book is no longer beige 
but a darker shade of brown  
 The S P and Dow have closed lower every session so far in
October with the exception of the record rally on Monday  with
volatility picking up  In five of the past eight sessions  the
Dow has seen wild swings of almost 370 points or more

The Nasdaq Composite Index  tumbled 150 68 points  or
8 47 percent  at 1 628 33 
 U S  economic data released before Bernanke spoke confirmed
his outlook and the fears of investors 
 U S  retailers posted their biggest monthly sales decline
in more than three years in September  while a gauge of New
York manufacturing fell in October to the lowest level since
its inception in 2001 
 Shares of big U S  retailers were bruised by the data  with
Dow components Wal Mart Stores   the world s largest
retailer  down 8 1 percent  and Home Depot  slipping 5 9
percent 
 The Dow is now only up about 1 4 percent on the week 
having given up the bulk of Monday s 11 percent rally 
 Exxon Mobil  was among the biggest drags on the Dow 
falling 14 percent as crude prices fell more than  4 a barrel 
Economic bellwether Caterpillar Inc  gave up 11 4
percent 
 The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
closed 6 5 percent lower at 903 67 points 
 Britain s FTSE 100  fell 7 2 percent  Germany s DAX
 slipped 6 5 percent and France s CAC 40  shed
6 8 percent 
 Investors dumped mining shares  tracking a sharp sell off
in commodity prices on recession concerns  Rio Tinto 
tumbled 17 percent and Anglo American  sank 20 percent 
  It s the beginning of the end of the financial crisis  but
beyond that a global recession is looming   said Emmanuel
Morano  head of equity management at La Francaise des
Placements  in Paris 
  Fears over a global recession are justified  and these
fears have been priced in very quickly  Valuations in the basic
resources sector are apocalyptic  This sell off really has the
violence of the crash of 1987  
 In the Treasury bond market  most U S  government debt
prices rose on a renewed safety bid  but longer maturity bond
prices fell as investors worried anew about the huge slug of
debt issuance that looms to pay for the U S  government s
measures to rescue the financial system 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note  gained
26 32 in price to yield 3 98 percent  while the 2 year U S 
Treasury note  rose 14 32 points to yield 1 59
percent 
 The dollar rose against major currencies  with the U S 
Dollar Index  up 0 69 percent at 82 141  Against the yen 
the dollar  fell 1 92 percent at 100 22 
 The euro  fell 0 98 percent at  1 3489 
 Spot gold prices  rose  9 65 to  844 90 an ounce 
 The gloomy economic news and rise in risk aversion came
despite trillions of dollars pledged worldwide to recapitalize
banks and stem the worst financial crisis since the 1930s 
 There were glimpses the concerted government efforts
already were taking effect  The rate banks charge each other
for dollar  euro and sterling loans fell for the second
straight day as recent bold steps from authorities around the
world continued to thaw out frozen money markets 
  Following the release of national  bailout  plans from UK 
Germany  France  U S  and others  there are early signs that
the severe money market tension of the last month may be
easing   said Meyrick Chapman  a strategist at UBS 
  We think the easing will continue   Chapman said

164267,385783,HD,UPDATE 1 Private equity execs offer grim economic forecast,news," Adds comments from Carlyle s David Rubenstein 
 By Michael Flaherty
 HONG KONG  Nov 13  Reuters    Top executives at some of the
world s largest private equity firms gave a grim forecast on
Thursday for the U S  and global economies  although they
expected Asia to recover from the downturn more quickly 
 Carlyle Group  CYl UL  co founder David Rubenstein said he
expected a recession in the United States to last longer than
the historical average of around 9 months 
  The recession this time will be far deeper than what we ve
seen for quite some time   he said 
  Unemployment is up  retail sales are down  I suspect the
recession will last at least a year  and I suspect quarter over
quarter to have negative growth of 2 to 4 percent   he said 
 The U S  unemployment rate was likely to go up to 10
percent  from a 14 year high of 6 5 percent in October 
Rubenstein added 
 Adding to the difficult economic period was a U S 
government administration in transition  he said  with
President elect Barack Obama not taking office until Jan  20 
 Bain Capital Managing Director Paul Edgerley expected U S 
home prices to drop another 15 20 percent and predicted  a very
deep recession  I think the worst we ve seen in my lifetime  
 He pointed out that 70 percent of the gross domestic
product in the United States is consumer spending 
  The consumer is beaten up and they have a long way to go  
Edgerley said at the Asian Venture Capital Journal private
equity conference in Hong Kong   It s going to take a long time
for the U S  economy to turn around and become a growth
engine  
 He added that the U S  was not alone  with the UK  Spain
and Ireland  probably in a bigger mess than the U S  is in
now  
 A deeper drop in U S  home prices would likely add further
challenges to Bain s investment in Home Depot Supply  which is
tied closely to the home building sector 
 David Bonderman  one of the the most influential figures in
the U S  private equity industry  said a global recession would
be deep and prolonged  and also believed the U S  housing
market would fall further 
 Both executives agreed that Asia  while getting hit by the
financial crisis  was well suited to withstand it  thanks in
part to banks  relative lack of exposure to risky subprime
mortgage securities which sparked the global financial crisis 
 Price to equity ratios are cheap in Asia  as Asian equities
tend to fall harder in a recession  Bonderman said  He also
noted that consumer spending was still rising across Asia 
although confidence is being dampened by falling stock markets
and concerns over the impact of the global fianncial crisis 
 Edgerley was more optimistic  saying the region was in a
better position to weather the financial storm  based on the
growth of its consumer market and burgeoning middle class 
Bain s Asia focus is on China  Japan and India 
  I think it s likely that China will grow at 7 to 8 percent
for most of 2009 and 2010   he said 
 He was less encouraging about India s prospects  as the
country s economy is not as driven by exports as China s  He
expected India s economy to grow 5 percent to 7 percent over
the next year as outside capital investment into the country
slowed 
 TPG has hit a rough patch lately  with several investments
getting hit by the credit crunch 
 The move by the U S  government in September to close and
sell the banking assets of savings and loan company Washington
Mutual Inc  to JP Morgan  wiped out a  1 35
billion investment from Texas based private equity firm TPG 
made five months earlier 
 It was the largest U S  bank failure ever  and a blow to
TPG s wallet as well as its reputation as one of the savviest
buyout investors across the globe 
 Bonderman said culprits in the credit crisis included the
accounting profession and mark to market accounting rules 
  With mark to market  you see artificially low prices 
unlike mark to model   the formula used by insurers  he said 
 When you force people to take a mark down  you cause a death
spiral  
 TPG s investments in BankThai  in Bangkok  Taiwan s
Taishin Financial Holdings  2887 TW  and Japanese consumer
finance company NIS Group  8751 T  are all under pressure 
 TPG Capital  formerly Texas Pacific Group  is one of the
largest private equity firms in the world  with more than  50
billion under management  Boston based Bain Capital is also
among the largest private equity firms globally  and is
currently investing a roughly  10 billion buyout fund 
 Edgerley  who joined Bain in 1988  has been behind
investments in such companies as chemicals company Brenntag 
Sensata Technologies  a carve out from Texas Instruments Inc

164268,385784,HD,ANALYSIS Global retailers feel China chill,news,"By Kirby Chien
 BEIJING  Jan 21  Reuters    Recession shockwaves are
swamping China s main coastal export zones and spreading 
pushing a fragmented and once fast growing retail sector to
consolidate as sales and profit margins shrink 
 Global giants such as Wal Mart Stores and Carrefour will
benefit along with China s growing consumer class  but rapid
expansion has caught some over extended  as their home markets
collapse in the face of a sharp economic downturn 
 China s  824 billion retail sector is still one of the
world s fastest growing  Smaller than Germany s in 2003  the
market could be almost twice as big by 2013  according to
Euromonitor 
  As the large get larger  major domestic and foreign
players with strong parents should survive as the market
consolidates   said Mavis Hui  retail analyst with DBS Vickers
in Hong Kong 
 Department stores such as Hong Kong based Parkson Retail
are pushing discounts to regain sales  and Kingfisher  Europe s
largest home improvements retailer  is closing stores ahead of
the week long Chinese New Year shopping period 
 As China s economy slows sharply  some retailers may be
forced to rethink their strategy 
  We re aware of some foreign retailers in China trying to
sell their operations  which could be picked up by someone else
at bargain prices   said Graham Matthews  partner with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Shanghai  noting  with others  that
home improvement chains are being hit hard by the global
property market collapse 
 WEAK SALES
 Standard   Poor s downgraded its outlook for Parkson 
China s second largest department store chain  to stable from
positive earlier this month  after a weak 7 8 percent
same store sales growth estimate   We expect the weak sales
trend to persist in 2009   S P said 
 Retailers globally are struggling as consumers cut back on
spending amid rising unemployment and fears of a deep
recession 
 U S  department store chain Gottschalks Inc filed for
bankruptcy last week  the latest in a list of battered
retailers  Hong Kong based garment retailer U Right
International  which rapidly expanded to over 600 stores
throughout China  filed for bankruptcy in October after running
out of cash 
 But Carrefour  China s leading hypermarket retailer  which
is buoyed by its recession resistant grocery business  expects
to open 28 new stores this year  up from 22 in 2008  though the
French firm has said it would compete aggressively on price 
  Total retail sales could still rise by the mid teens this
year   said DBS Vickers  Hui   But the steep discounts we re
seeing could pressure margins for selective players  
 OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS
 Deals may slow in the near term as risk appetite is low and
those with cash may want to hold it  PWC reckons  But it sees
opportunities 
 Kingfisher  owner of the B Q franchise  is seen as a prime
target  It posted a surprise third quarter loss in its China
operations late last year as sales slumped by a third 
 Home improvement stores such as Kingfisher and Home Depot 
which has also expanded aggressively in China  have been hurt
by a global property market slump 
 Kingfisher expects more store closures in China  a sharp
turnaround from mid 2007  when B Q China sales growth was
humming along at over 40 percent and it had plans to open 8 12
stores annually to over 130 locations 
 Still  even during the best of times  China only accounted
for a small fraction of total sales for the big global
retailers 
 Wal Mart  the world s largest retailer  is shifting its
focus from mature markets to countries like Mexico  China and
Brazil  But China accounts for just over 100 stores from a
global stable of some 7 200 Wal Mart facilities 
 Other niche players such as coffee shop chain Starbucks 
which is closing stores in its home U S  market  will continue
to expand because their penetration in China and other emerging
markets is still at a relatively early stage 
 CONSUMER CONFIDENCE KEY
 Three fifths of consumers in major Chinese cities expect to
spend less this year on luxury goods  branded apparel and
entertainment  according to consultancy Data Driven Marketing
Asia  And the outlook is not likely to improve any time soon 
 U S  retail sales fell a steep 2 7 percent in December 
signalling a sharper economic contraction than had been
thought 
 That is bad news for China as the United States is its
single largest export market  Analysts forecast the Chinese
economy could grow 8 percent this year  a level widely regarded
as a minimum to absorb millions of new job seekers 
 High flying Chinese consumers had once snapped up luxury
cars at a record pace  but the global downturn has exposed a
fragile spending class that must increasingly plan and pay for
its own healthcare  education and retirement 
  Quite frankly  I m not particularly thrilled with
 China s  policy recipe   Stephen Roach  Asia chairman for
Morgan Stanley  told a conference in Beijing last month   China
needs to shift its growth dynamic away from investment and
exports     and increase consumption  
 China s household consumption in 2007 made up just 35 3
percent of economic output  a record low for a major country in
peacetime  In the 1980s  it was over 50 percent  versus 72
percent in the United States 
 The reluctance to buy is evident at Solana  one of
Beijing s newest mega malls with over 200 stores and vendors 
but where spending customers are sparse on weekdays and many
stalls are still waiting for tenants 
  You can see business is not good  how can it be good

164307,385823,HD,The Best Performing Stock For The Past 34 Years Will Surprise You,opinion,"For most people  their house is their biggest investment  Some have done a lot better than others depending on the price they paid and the region they chose to live in  What very few realize is that investing in home improvement stores would have been a lot more lucrative  In fact  the best performing stock for the past 34 years is a home improvement store 
Today  Home Depot  N HD  closed at new all time highs near  126 per share   5000 invested in its stock on its IPO day in 1981 is worth about  25 Million today  Very few stocks have managed to average 28  annual returns over the course of so many years 

Of course  I write this with the benefit of hindsight  Finding stocks with great potential is a lot easier than holding them through the inevitable drawdowns they go through  For example  Home Depot had a 71  pullback during the bear market of early 2000s  Then  it had another 50  correction in 2007 2008  It takes a lot of conviction to hold a stock through such big setbacks  I would venture to say that the total number of individuals who bought Home Depot on its IPO day and are still holding it  is probably very close to zero 
Don t forget that for each Home Depot that recovers from a 70  drawdown  there are 20 other story stocks that either never come back to new highs or they take decades to do so  A simple trend following system that would sell Home Depot every time it closes below its 20 month moving average and buys it back when it makes new 52 week highs would have achieved three results 
Catch all of the upside 
Eliminate most of the scary corrections and limit drawdowns

EUR USD
On Tuesday the euro fell steadily remaining near seven month lows  as optimistic U S  inflation data augmented hawkish arguments for an interest rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee  when it meets again next month 
Markets shrugged off a report by the ZEW Centre for Economic Research showing that its index of German economic sentiment rose by 8 5 points to 10 4 this month from October s reading of 1 9  which was a 12 month low  Analysts had expected the index to rise by 4 1 points to 6 0 in November

Gold
Gold fell sharply on Tuesday to fresh five year lows  as investors continued to brush off geopolitical concerns stemming from last week s terrorist attacks in Paris  dampening the precious metal s value as a safe haven asset 
Furthermore throughout the month of November  gold has been in freefall as investors continue to prepare for the increasing likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise short term interest rates when it meets again next month  Over the last month of trading  gold has plunged nearly 10   falling to levels previously not seen since February  2010

U S  stocks forfeited gains on Tuesday after the soccer match between Germany and the Netherlands was called off over fears of a bombing 
All three major U S  indexes had ventured into positive territory following upbeat earnings reports from Wal Mart  N WMT  and Home Depot  N HD   but they quickly relinquished those gains after the friendly match was canceled less than two hours before its start  due to indications of a planned attack with explosives at the stadium in Hanover

164316,385832,HD,How Will Home Depot Achieve  101 Billion Annual Revenue In 3 Years,opinion,"Home Depot targets  101 billion in annual revenues by 2018 
Home Depot models 27  improvement in ROIC in the current year 
Home Depot s buyback spending to reach  7 billion this year 

Home Depot Inc  NYSE N HD  recently revealed its financial plan covering three years   and it s an ambitious one  Its current financial target was set in 2013 and will expire by the end of 2015  In the existing growth plan  Home Depot seeks to improve operating margin by 13  and return on invested capital  ROIC  by 27  by the end of life of the existing plan 
The new financial plan for three years will run until 2018 when the company hopes to have attained annual revenues of  101 billion  Home Depot also targets 14 5  in operating margins and 35  return on invested capital  ROIC  by the end of 2018   88 billion in sales is targeted by the end of the year  along with  101 billion sales forecast by 2018  which implies about an 4 7  compound annual growth rate  CAGR  
The chart below shows Home Depot s annual revenue trendline alongside the guided revenue metrics 

Reaching the target
Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD  has outlined multiple strategies through which it hopes to achieve its ambitious sales target of  101 billion by 2018  The growth strategies are part of Home Depot s Interconnecting Retail framework  Here is a highlight about the strategies 
Product Authority  Home Depot is committing to business in the usual sense that the company is betting on innovation in driving the best value to customers 
Customer Service  The retailer intends to offer a seamless experience for its customers regardless of how and where they interact with it  That means blurring the line between physical and online shopping experience among other implementations 
Productivity  Home Depot is committing to drive incremental benefits within its supply chain and stores as part of the efforts to reach its ambitious financial plans by 2018 
Targeted growth areas  The retailer is looking at opportunities to increase sales through channels such as professional contractors and business customers 
Shareholder Returns  Home Depot wants to deliver increasing total value to its shareholders  which will primarily be in the form of buybacks and dividends  In terms of buybacks  Home Depot intends to repurchase  2 billion worth of its stock  a move that should bring its fiscal 2015 buyback spending to about  7 billion 
Growth drivers
Outlining how to go about achieving growth targets is one thing and reaching the targets is another  Does Home Depot have what it takes to make its ambitious financial plan a reality 
Restructuring positions HD for more growth
Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD  is a beneficially of system restructuring  The company has closed multiple non performing stores  exited non core operations and sought to improve productivity  Investment in frictionless sales channels has also been a priority at Home Depot 
Although some of the aforementioned restructuring measures have run their course  Home Depot can do more to drive performance improvement  For example  there exist room for continued efficiency drive  which should result in improved earnings and free cash flow for increasing return to shareholders in the coming years 
Continued investment in digital fulfillment channels should also lift overall sales and provide an avenue for performance improvement 
The bulk of home improvement trends remain unexploited
The U S  home improvement trends are favorable  However  only a tiny fraction of the demand trend has been met  which means that there remains for sales opportunities ahead for Home Depot as the retailer enters a new year 
In addition to the prevailing demand trends  stronger than expected recovery in the home improvement space should come as a tailwind for Home Depot 
Cost curtailment
Disciplined cost structure is important in achieving Home Depot s financial targets  Without compromising on value laden capital expenditures  management of the home improvement retailer is likely to maintain focus on cost curtailment measures  Such measures should boost margins expansion  which is important for the various margin and ROIC targets for the next three years 
Capital program
Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD  is likely to finish 2015 with  7 billion returned to shareholders through buybacks alone  However  the company s shareholder capital return also includes dividend payout  With the management committing to sweeten buyback and dividend metrics going forward  there is certainly more in store for Home Depot investors 
Pressure points
It is not all smooth for Home Depot  though  and there are risks the company could miss its performance targets  primarily because of issues beyond its control 
Here are some factors that could scuttle Home Depot s dream 
Market deterioration
The housing market is on a recovery trend and Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD  is expected to benefit from the trend given its favorable position in the home improvement industry  However  sudden deterioration of the housing market could not only delay Home Depot s anticipated gains  but also wreck havoc in its financial plan 
Demand for Home Depot s products and services tracks property sales  That means that slowdown in property sales because of unfavorable market condition can have far reaching implications on the retailers performance  Additionally  weak home prices can also impact big ticket home renovation  thereby also putting pressure on Home Depot s sales 
Credit availability
Big ticket home improvements are boon for Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD  and that segment thrives on financing  As such  developments that hurt availability of credit could adversely impact big ticket renovation projects  thus cooling Home Depot product service sales 
Property price wars
Sometimes home sales play with price to help them move more properties  However  irrational price war is a double edged sword and Home Depot cannot be spared when such wars break out  While it might be able to sale more  its profit margins are likely to be compressed by sales are motivated by lower prices 
Unfavorable macroeconomic conditions
Home improvement business thrives in an environment of strong consumer spending  As such  factors such as high cost of fuel  rising interest rates and high unemployment levels threaten sales of home renovation products and Home Depot can feel great pressure in its business on a bad day 
Foreign exchange pressure
Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD  generates nearly 10  of its sales abroad  especially from Canada and Mexico  Unfavorable foreign exchange rates are already impact sales of many U S  multinationals  With a substantial amount of its sales coming from the international market  Home Depot is greatly exposed to foreign exchange pressures 
Bottom line
Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD  s three year growth plans inspire  It is also important that the management continue to see growth headroom  However  there are factors beyond Home Depot s control that can adversely impact its performance

164317,385833,HD,This Big Box Trade Has Potential,opinion,"Home Depot  N HD  has been a great stock over the last several years  A solid trend higher and then consolidation  Then another trend higher and consolidation  Lather  rinse  repeat as they say  Currently it looks to be in a short term consolidation after pulling out of the longer consolidation in September 
Momentum
The weekly chart below shows a few salient items  First  the momentum is still strong with the RSI in the bullish range and the MACD leveling but positive  Second  notice that every time the price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band  it has pulled back or consolidated  like it s doing now  And it s consolidating for the right reasons  Next  the risk seems to be to the 20 week SMA  currently around 123  Each time it has broken that level it has found support and rebounded 

With these thoughts and a longer term view higher we entered a trade on Monday to buy the stock and add a collar as protection into February options expiration  or for the next 2 months  We bought a February 130 120 Put Spread and sold a March 140 Covered Call against the stock for  1  That gives protection down to 120 in case the consolidation turns into a pullback  It also allows 7  upside until March without making any adjustments 
This is Step 1  Step 2 will come in the future and I can t yet tell what it will be  It might be selling the Put Spread to monetize the hedge  it might be rolling the March 140 Covered Calls out to June and up to the 150 Strike  Or it might be something completely different

164332,385848,HD,Industrial REITs  A Small Universe,opinion,"All around the world  e commerce is growing faster than traditional retail sales  In fact  forecasters say e commerce will account for 30  of all retail sales in the United States by 2030  Yet most people don t give a second thought to what happens once they click the  buy  button online 
In reality  the items they purchase go through real brick and mortar warehouses and fulfillment centers before arriving at their front door  And therein lies an opportunity for income investors 
The E Commerce Opportunity
Many of these warehouses are owned by so called industrial REITs that pay nice dividends 
Now  industrial REITs have underperformed other REITs for nearly two decades   but e commerce has awoken this once sleepy sector  You see  e commerce companies require up to 300  more logistics space compared to brick and mortar counterparts 
It s not surprising  therefore  that demand for industrial space has more than doubled recently  Today  e commerce companies are using as much as 30  of industrial space and  according to industry observers  that percentage is likely to climb even higher in the years ahead 
By the end of 2014  the industrial REIT occupancy rate had risen to an impressive 94 3   Meanwhile  industrial REITs are projected to have excellent funds from operation  FFO  growth in 2015  SNL Financial forecast FFO growth of 7 8  for industrial REITs this year versus 7 2  for all equity REITs 
With demand increasing  SNL also believes industrial REITs will be able to raise their rents  leading to increased same store net operating income  SSNOI  and greater revenue growth 
Industrial REITs  A Small Universe
For investors  the industrial REIT group is an easy one to get a hold on  It comprises just eight publicly traded companies  and their total market capitalization is less than  30 billion 
The largest industrial REIT  by far  is Prologis   NYSE PLD   which has a market cap of about  19 6 billion  The others  in order of descending market cap  are  DCT Industrial Trust  NYSE DCT   First Industrial Realty Trust  NYSE FR   EastGroup Properties  NYSE EGP   STAG Industrial  NYSE STAG   Terreno Realty  NYSE TRNO   Rexford Industrial Realty  NYSE REXR   and Monmouth Real Estate  NYSE MNR  
It s worth noting the smaller options  but the preeminent company in the sector is clearly Prologis  Its operating portfolio consists of nearly 2 900 industrial properties  and it owns  manages  or is developing approximately 670 million square feet of space 
Prologis has a global reach  with facilities in 21 countries across four continents  Better yet  it s exposed to 70  of the world s gross domestic product  GDP   That includes fast growth areas such as Asia  where Prologis owns 51 million square feet of space as of June 30  2015 
To top it off  Prologis has more than 5 200 customers worldwide  the largest of which include familiar names such as Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   Deutsche Post  XETRA DPWGn   FedEx  NYSE FDX   and Home Depot  NYSE HD   Prologis  current global occupancy rate is a very nice 95 4  
Now  when a company focuses on growth as Prologis historically has  the dividend is typically low  But the current market downturn has pushed the company s yield up to a very respectable 4 2   Plus  Prologis has paid attention to its dividend in recent years 
Between 2013 and 2014  it raised the dividend by about 18   and it has already raised its dividend rate by about 20  in 2015 
With e commerce growth set to continue  the dividend should increase in the years ahead  That makes Prologis a conservative way to play the e commerce boom  without having to endure the roller coaster ride of  say  Amazon ",2015-09-13,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/prologis-to-benefit-from-e-commerce-boom-264839,264839

164358,385874,HD,A Surprisingly Simple Strategy To Negate Loss,opinion," Frankly  99  of retail investors out there are acting like complete morons  
So says Jonathan Rodriguez  Wall Street Daily s Senior Analyst and a renowned pattern trading expert 
What s more  Jonathan tells me that he s discovered a surprisingly simple way for everyday investors to improve their performance using nothing more than their home computers 
 In 2014  over a third of investors combined to produce negative returns  All of those losses could ve been avoided   Jonathan says 
I decided to dig into the world of a pattern trading expert and figure out exactly what s going on 
Getting Ahead of Wall Street
I walk into Jonathan s office  and he s looking at stock prices on each of his three monitors 
The candlestick charts are overlaid with an array of lines  some curving   moving averages   and others perfectly horizontal   Fibonacci retracements 
Now  you may have heard of these lines  They re used by many analysts  after all  But they barely scratch the surface of what Jonathan is doing 
As soon as I m in the door  Jonathan pokes a monitor displaying Home Depot s  NYSE HD  chart and starts talking  He shows me levels of resistance and support  and explains how we can identify the best entry points 
Isn t this just basic technical analysis  I wonder 
As it turns out  that couldn t be further from the truth 
In short  Jonathan s strategy relies on huge  market wide patterns that are emerging from the chaos of the Cyborg Finance Revolution 
Though complicated in practice  the gist of it is simple  Wall Street has unintentionally tipped its hand 
Supercomputers are trading tens of millions of shares every day  and they re all searching for the most efficient price points  With so much automation in the market  including the matching engines that facilitate dark pool trades  it was inevitable that patterns would emerge from the chaos 
   subtle but telling clues to the trades taking place within them  Well  Jonathan spotted these footprints  and he s figured out when they re going to appear again 
You see  even the largest financial institutions in the world  trading in invisible pools of liquidity  are inevitably trading along certain patterns 
By using these patterns  which can t help but repeat  Jonathan is able to identify better entry and exit points for literally any trade 
The Cyborg Finance Revolution
Now  if the computerization of the stock market was just a passing fad  then this wouldn t be a worthwhile strategy 
But automation is the new reality  The days of the frantic pit traders are behind us  and supercomputers  dark pools  and matching equations are here to stay ",2015-06-28,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-surprisingly-simple-strategy-to-negate-loss-256431,256431
164359,385875,HD,Home Depot And My Portfolio,opinion,"I was at Home Depot  NYSE HD  over the weekend when I wandered into aisle 3  Portfolio  Bet you did not know Home Depot even had a portfolio aisle  Well  just past the 401k s  IRA s and Mutual Funds was something interesting  A promotion for their own stock  Normally I might look at the generic brand as inferior  but I took a closer look 
The chart below got me thinking of the potential benefits of adding Home Depot s stock to my portfolio  This stock had a nice run higher from the 80 level in August 2014 to a high just under 120 in February  Since then it has pulled back in a rather shallow channel  The top side has been a falling resistance line with a bit more variability on the downside moves 

What is intriguing about this chart is how it has not taken part in the bigger swings of the broad market as it moves sideways  It is also still well above the 200 day SMA  The momentum indicators are mixed  with the RSI still bullish but the MACD crossed down  But the MACD has been broadly trending higher since the beginning of May 
I have drawn an AB CD pattern on this to show approximately where it could project to over time  This assumes a pullback to the 200 day SMA at some point soon  But from there  or here  a move higher over 116 would look toward 150  The company pays a 2 36  dividend yield  prompts me to consider it now  despite the fact it doesn t report until August 18 
I want to buy this with protection for earnings and allow for long term upside  To do so I m buying the stock and then adding a August 111 106 Put Spread for protection and selling a September 4 Expiry 117 Covered Call to fund it  The total Collar cost is 2 cents  which gives protection between 111 and 106 for the earnings report  It also allows for upside to 117 without an adjustment  That leaves less than  2 downside exposure to the stock until earnings

Retail on Thin Ice 
Market pundits believe that an unfavorable weather condition  weakening of foreign currencies  subdued business investment  labor dispute at West Coast ports and lower oil prices that dented the energy sector came in the way of economic expansion in the first quarter  A strong dollar led to attractive imports but dampened exports that plunged 7 2   Consequently  consumer spending  which accounts for over two thirds of the U S  economic activity  also decelerated to a rate of 1 9  in the quarter from 4 4  in fourth quarter 2014  Analysts believe that all these in turn may have played a vital role over the timing of the Federal Reserve s interest rates rise  which has most probably been put aside for the time being  Shrugging off these disappointing figures  a panel of economists still believes that the underlying fundamentals are strong enough to drive the economy and withstand the overseas turmoil  They expect the economy to grow at a pace of about 3  in 2015  Gradual recovery in the housing market  a strengthening manufacturing sector  an improving labor market and lower gasoline prices are favoring the economy and boosting consumers  purchasing power  Moreover  as temporary factors  such as harsh weather and port unrest take a back seat  the economy will be bounce back  although it may have to endure a stronger dollar for some time  Confidence was also instilled by the 0 4  increase in consumer spending during March  following a modest jump of 0 2  in February from a decline of 0 3  in January  Moreover  job prospects should encourage spending  A recent data shows that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits dropped 34 000 for the week ended April 25  to a seasonally adjusted 262 000 versus 290 000 expected  and the unemployment rate is lingering at around 5 5   its lowest level in six years  Consumer confidence   a key determinant of financial health   is also improving significantly  making the future look brighter  In fact  the recent data released by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters showed that the consumer sentiment index jumped to 95 9 in April from the March reading of 93 0  The year ahead looks promising for retailers as stock prices gain momentum  the employment picture improves and consumer confidence moves north  This would help the retail stocks take center stage  Given its wide spectrum  the Retail Wholesale sector remains a lucrative investment opportunity  and identifying the future winners from the sector would be a prudent idea

Contributing analysts on  expect Home Depot to top Wall Street s earnings consensus by 2 cents per share  That s what contributors predicted last quarter and exactly what Home Depot reported  The difference this period is that Home Depot s price to earnings ratio has become bloated ahead of the earnings release

Home Depot is expected to post fourth quarter EPS of  1 91  two pennies higher than the Street s consensus  This would mark the eighth quarter of double digit earnings growth in the last nine quarters  Revenues are expected to come in at  18 73B  about  60M higher than the Wall Street prediction  and only 4 2  higher than the year ago period  The country s largest home improvement retailer is expected to benefit from an increase in consumer spending in the latest quarter backed by falling gasoline prices and a better employment picture which has left people with more discretionary income  Improving macroeconomic conditions in the U S  have spurred activity in the housing market  which was particularly strong towards the end of 2014  Some issues that have plagued other S P 500 companies this season  such as the stronger dollar  will not be a problem for Home Depot as 87  of their stores are located in the US  The company s stock recently leapt to an all time high of  112 45 on Feb 19 

Lowe s is the country s second largest home improvement retailer and is set to report Wednesday before the bell  The Estimize consensus currently stands at  0 45  a penny higher than Wall Street  This would represent growth of 45   the eighth consecutive quarter of double digit earnings growth  Revenues are expected to come in at  12 3B  about  20M higher than the Street  marking YoY growth of about 6   which is still great for a company of this size  Lowe s should benefit from the same macroeconomic improvements that Home Depot will  Existing home sales is one of the most important drivers for the industry because existing homeowners typically make home improvements before putting a house up for sale  In October existing home sales hit a one year high  and while that figure dipped in November  it rose again in December  making Q4 a strong one for the existing housing market ",2015-02-24,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stronger-housing-data-should-lead-to-beats-from-the-home-improvement-ret-242866,242866
164399,385915,HD,From The Floor  Opec Basks As Brent WTI Spread Widens,opinion,"Brent WTI spread widens to highest in more than a year
WTI price continues to stand still as US inventories rise again  says Hansen
Opec reap benefits from Brent s rise and market share strategy
China s stocks in sharp rally after hints on fiscal policy move grow stronger
Europe and Home Depot  NYSE HD  is a Yes  but Royal Bank of Scotland  LONDON RBS  Group PLC  NYSE RBS  is a No  says Garnry
Bunds hit all time record and continue to hit new highs this morning  says Boye

Opec s blueprint The spread between Brent crude and WTI has widened to a 12 month plus high of  10 78 barrel and someone very high up in Opec is probably enjoying the wryest of smiles as we speak 
Far be it for from the floor to suggest a masterplan has been at work here  but with the global oil cartel s pricing linked to the Brent benchmark  the hold market share at all costs strategy embarked upon at its November meeting is starting to pay dividends  This is a really nice situation for Opec and its members with their profitability going up while WTI stands still and that means there is very little support for the shale sector in the US   says Saxo Bank s head of commodities  Ole Hansen 
Demand is on the rise for Brent  according to a senior Opec official yesterday from Saudi Arabia  helping to propel it to  61 45 barrel at 0755 GMT today  a stark contrast to WTI s laboured  50 73 b 
Yet another huge increase in US oil inventories in yesterday s EIA report is stymieing any hopes WTI has of joining Brent on its upward trajectory with inventories at main US storage hub Cushing rising to 48 6 million barrels 
That has also seen the contango between the front month WTI price and the second month widen to  2 b leaving the US benchmark seemingly marooned in  rangebound territory for a while   says Hansen 
Hansen suggests that while there may be a selloff this morning  Brent crude could yet go higher to test the  63 b and even the  65 b area while WTI  is going nowhere fast   
China s New Year gift Meanwhile  we could be about to witness another rally in Chinese equities  perhaps not unlike the one we saw in the autumn of 2014 
 There has been a nice rally in mainland Chinese stocks on talk that the government will take steps to address the ongoing domestic slowdown   says Christoffer Moltke Leth  speaking live from Saxo Bank s Singapore hub   Prime minister Li Keqiang has called for a more active fiscal policy and the People s Bank of China also issued a report that mentioned the possibility of monetary easing  
This being China  the timing could well be part of a coordinated effort to ready markets for some kind of accommodation with key meetings in March due to set the government budgetary agendas for the year  says Moltke Leth 
Despite that  AUD USD  which normally reacts well to any positivity out of China slumped 30 pips during trading to an intraday low of 78 40 driven by the prospect of a possible RBA cut next week after a disappointing Q4 private sector capex print Concertina effect
Elsewhere in currency markets and specifically in the FX Options  space  the concertina effect is most definitely at the squeeze phase with vols on EUR USD one month at the money down to 8 3 from yesterday s 9 1 and Tuesday s 10 6 
It s a similar story for USD JPY one month  says the desk s Kim Nydahl Gr nlund from the Copenhagen floor  with vols at 8 1 from 8 8 Wednesday and 9 6 on Tuesday 
 Options are lacking a catalyst with Yellen and Greece now seemingly out of the way   he says  These sharp moves down in vols are likely to continue  
Little house on the prarieThe prospects of a housing boom in the US meanwhile  marks Home Depot out as an  alpha  pick after it posted very strong results earlier this week  says head of equities at Saxo bank  Peter Garnry 
 it s got a very good balance between quality valuation and price action and this is being helped by what is beginning to look like a bullish US housing recovery   he says 
Garnry also is sticking firmly to his conviction that Europe is  the place to be  in 2015  if equities is your thing   The market may already be up 10  but that train has most definitely not left the station and it is looking extremely good for European equities  Garnry cites very strong German confidence figures this morning and the prospects of a 4  rise in Irish GDP as yet further indications that the signs are looking good for Europe despite the well documented headwinds 
He is less sanguine about the prospects for beleaguered RBS  however  which  while narrowing its losses this morning from  8 5 billion to  3 5bn  is not one that investors should be looking at yet 
 There is so much uncertainty about execution and the business strategy and I think investors are getting a little bit carried away because of the improving UK economy   he says 
Bunds bounceFinally  German bunds bounced to a record 159 58 yesterday and then topped that with 158 70 this morning  says the Fixed Income s Michael Boye 
 The yield is up by 32 basis points   he says  but adds a warning on Greece 
 There is still a long way to go on Greece where it is a developing story and we are certainly not out of the woods on that one   he says ",2015-02-26,Saxo Bank,https://www.investing.com/analysis/from-the-floor:-opec-basks-as-brent-wti-spread-widens-243209,243209

164401,385917,HD,Home Depot  Long Term Uptrend On A Pullback,opinion,"Home Depot  NYSE HD  was a stock market darling from mid 2011 to mid 2013  It ran out of a base of over 40 to a new base between 73 and 83  Then it pushed higher again  It now sits    consolidating in the weekly chart below    at about 115  That s quite a run but the Measured Move suggests its run may not be over  It may have up to 130 in its future 

So you might think it s time to buy Home Depot  But that s not the case  No move goes straight in one direction all the time  And when you take a closer look at the price action    as on the daily timeframe below    it appears there may be a pullback in the cards  So what do you do when you want to own a stock that is in a long term uptrend  but is pulling back  One thing you can do is wait for the pullback to end and then buy it  A simple strategy for sure  but one that requires patience  There s a second alternative  though  Use options to design a trade now that may get you into the stock lower when you can make money as it falls 

Take a closer look at the one day chart above  The RSI is making a lower low and the MACD is falling as the price is moving below the 20 day SMA  That supports a downside move while also staying in a bullish range  The rising trend support line in red is now riding the 50 day SMA higher  That 50 day SMA has been support several times during pullbacks in this move higher  If you believe that the longer trend continues  this chart is a road map to a better entry 
First some mechanics  Pullbacks tend to happen faster than grinds higher    the trade will look to gain an entry or make money over the next 3 weeks  This is prior to the next earnings release in late May  So look for an entry just below the trend and 50 day SMA  To accommodate that you could buy an April 114 112 111 1 2 Put Spread  which means buying the April 114 Put and selling both an April 112 and 110 Put  Putting on this trade is free as long as the cost of the long Put is covered by the credit from the 2 short Puts 
At a price between 112 and 110 at April Expiry  you make  2 on the trade  Above 114 you make nothing and all the options expire  And below 110 you will be put the stock with a basis of 108  So the profit zone is from 114 to 108  This trade does  however  require margin make  But it is the same margin you would use if you bought the stock  like you were going to do originally ",2015-03-25,Gregory W.

164420,385936,HD,3 Reasons Why Lowe s Stock Is Poised To Soar,opinion,"Lowe s Companies  NYSE LOW  s is in a unique position in an industry that has experienced surging stock prices in the last half of 2014  the home improvement space  Now  I know what you may be thinking   Home improvement  Hasn t that ship already sailed   Not quite  The housing market continues to improve  along with the home improvement industry  as they are directly linked 
First  we will point out why this industry outlook is positive  Then  we will put Lowe s  LOW     into focus in order to highlight the fact that it is indeed outperforming the rest of the industry  The position Lowe s is in right now coupled with the current growth the industry is experiencing sets it up well to outpace earnings expectations and to be a stock worth a closer look for your portfolio in 2015 
The Grass is Greener on the Other Side
Improved Housing Market People have great reasons to buy homes as of late  sending demand for the sector sharply higher  Among these reasons are the very low interest rates on mortgages and home purchases  People seem aware of the opportunity  as the Housing Market index reflects favorably upon current conditions  measuring 57 in January  Something maintaining the high status of the index in January is present sales  which is at 62  A level above 50 for the index indicates a positive outlook for home sales   As mentioned earlier  home improvement is directly linked to the housing sector  Of course  this would seem like common sense to most  However  what you may not be aware of is why LOW is the company in the sector that is most likely to give investors healthy returns in light of the positive outlook of the housing market Exceeding Industry Performance Lowe s is a leader in the home improvement industry  Its only real direct competitor is Home Depot  which downgraded from a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  to a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  in the last week  Lowe s has a 23 5  growth rate for this year  outperforming Home Depot s  NYSE HD    growth rate for this year of 19 4    Lowe s maintains a balanced budget with a debt to equity ratio of 1 01  while Home Depot s ratio is less favorable with a ratio of 1 65  Indeed  less is more  at least for this ratio   The ratio indicates less leverage being used on Lowe s part  relying more on the strength of its equity to keep up with liabilities the company is responsible for  In a world where leverage seems to be the preferred option to turn over profits  Lowe s avoids the risk that comes with leverage by handling its debts responsibly  
The ticker is LOW  but Expectations aren t 
 Since last week  Lowe s has had its Zacks Rank  3  Hold  turn into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This is a major factor  as this is an indicator pointing to positive expectations from Lowe s  The year over year growth estimate for the current quarter is a whopping 40 78    Expected EPS growth for the year is 15 73   beating expected EPS expectations for Home Depot  albeit slightly  The beta on Lowe s is indeed low at 1 18 while LOW has a 1 35  dividend  suggesting you can expect more security with this already low volatility stock  
Bottom Line
 The housing market s positive momentum has continued into January  As the home improvement industry is directly dependent on results from the housing market  the short term outlook is positive   Lowe s is an industry leader with many advantages over its direct competitor  Home Depot   Investing in Lowe s has a lower amount of risk associated with it  Lowe s is expected to grow year over year at a high rate for this quarter  The upside that Lowe s has going for it makes LOW an interesting ticker to keep an eye on going into the company s earnings report next month ",2015-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-lowe's-stock-is-poised-to-soar-239335,239335

164442,385958,HD,Trust  But Verify  Home Depot,opinion,"Stocks have made some major moves since the lows of the Droptoberfest  selloff  The S P 500 itself has moved over 120 points in 5 days  That is a lot  But is it safe to put your money back to work  Can you trust this market  As President Ronald Reagan used to say   Trust but verify   Let s look at Home Depot  NYSE HD  to see how to do that 

Home Depot is one of many stocks that have rebounded strongly  Four strong candlesticks higher and it is all the way back at the prior high  The RSI is back in the bullish zone and the MACD is about to cross up  All is looking great  Except that there are some gaps in the move higher  Oh  and the volume is light and actually falling off  Hmmm  You could keep your position and raise you stop as it sits near resistance  But that won t help if Germany sells off 3  overnight  A better way is to put on a collar 
A collar is nothing more that selling a Covered Call and then buying a Put for downside protection  For Home Depot  a break over the resistance zone would target a move to 100  so consider selling the November 100 Calls  The downside protection is a shorter term issue  so for that  look to the October 31 Expiry  and maybe buy the 94 90 Put Spread  This gives protection over the next week  against a 4  down move while you sleep  If the stock has not dropped by then  your profits have been building as it broke to new highs  a good thing 
The 3 option combination  selling the November 100 Calls  buying the October 31 Expiry 94 Puts and selling the October 31 Expiry 90 Puts  cost less than 60 cents  In this way you continue to own the stock  and trust the move  But you also have protection  to verify it

Analysts on  are expecting Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD  to announce earnings of  1 15 per share  topping Wall Steet s EPS consensus by 2 cents  In August Home Depot had a huge win when it came out with earnings of  1 52 per share  beating the the Street s consensus by 8 cents per share and coming in 7 cents above the forecast from Estimize  Company stock jumped 8 2  higher over the 3 days after last quarter s results and Home Depot shares have continued to show strength throughout the quarter heading into Tuesday s report 

 Graph above from ChartIQ Visual Earnings 
Tuesday contributing  which is a tick down from the 23  gain reported last quarter  However  a 21  boost to the bottom line would still be the second best quarter recorded over the previous 12 months   
While profit gains have been robust lately  revenue improvements have been more modest   In the first two quarters of this year Home Depot reported sales growth of 3  and 6  respectively 
For the third quarter the Estimize community is projecting a 5  improvement  A 5  gain would be the company s second best quarter reported over the past year  bested only by the 6  increase registered over the summer 

Since April of this year home sales have been trending higher  Alongside rising housing numbers we ve also seen earnings expectations on the Estimize platform surge  Since September the Estimize revenue consensus has increased by  76 million and Wall Street recently raised its estimates too 
The Street s EPS consensus has climbed from  1 11 in July to  1 13 ahead of the report while the Estimize consensus also jumped 2 cents higher from  1 13 to  1 15  Upward analyst estimate revisions heading into a report are often a bullish indicator 

In addition to posting strong results in the second quarter Home Depot also raised its guidance for the year citing an improved outlook  Stock buybacks are also a factor fueling EPS growth  As of August Home Depot had already repurchased  3 5 billion worth of shares this year and had the intent to purchase another  3 5 billion of stock before the end of the year

The Markets
Stocks ended higher following upbeat earnings from TJX Companies Inc  NYSE TJX  and Dow component Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD  Shares of each company gapped up at the open  fuelling the broad retail sector to strong gains on the session  Retail stocks have been struggling in 2014  remaining below the flat line for the year as investors find reasons to be concerned of the strength of the consumer  With oil prices plunging and the back to school season upon us  investors are being enticed back into discretionary allocations  The Retail Index ETF  SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT  has been supported by a rising trendline stemming from the February low  an ascending triangle is becoming apparent  a bullish setup that would be confirmed by a break above the year to date high around  89  The retail industry has recorded gains  on average  in the weeks leading up to the start of the school season in September  the more predominant period of seasonal strength occurs from October to early December  often referred to as the Christmas shopping season 






The positive returns in equity markets comes amidst further gains in the US Dollar  a trend that is not seasonally typical for this time of year  The US Dollar Index broke firmly above resistance around 81 50  moving to the highest level in almost a year  The currency benchmark has been supported by a rising 20 day moving average over recent weeks  implying a positive short term trend  The 200 day moving average is also starting to point positive for the first time this year  implying positive long term momentum  Seasonally  the US Dollar Index is frequently weak during the months of September and October  recording declines 60  and 75  of the time  respectively 


The stronger dollar continues to have an impact on the commodity market  The CRB commodity index is now down around 8 4  from the June peak  Commodities was one of the best performing asset classes during the first half of the year  but now it is quickly becoming the worst  If lower commodity prices are sustained  consumer stocks may benefit  The price of oil  which was a significant reason for the strength in the CRB index during the first half of the year  has declined significantly since June from highs of over  100 a barrel  Sustained lower oil prices typically ease the strain on the consumer  a much needed benefit during the critical season for retailers ahead  The energy commodity continues to hover around oversold levels  but signs of bottoming have yet to become apparent  Significant support exists around  91 50 The price of Oil enters a period of seasonal weakness in September  following the conclusion of the summer driving season

The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Home Depot to report 99c EPS and  19 973B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 27 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  1 00 EPS and  20 093B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Home Depot to edge past the Wall Street consensus by 1c in earnings and a comfortable margin on sales 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Home Depot s EPS every time and has been more accurate in predicting revenue 5 times  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing a larger than usual differential in revenue expectations but a smaller difference than usual in earnings projections 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 90c to  1 03 per share and from  19 633B to  20 463B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a moderate range of estimates on Home Depot 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Throughout the quarter the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from a high of  1 02 to 99c while the Estimize consensus dropped from  1 03 to  1 00  Meanwhile Wall Street reduced its revenue consensus from  20 240B to  19 973B while the Estimize consensus slid from  20 267B to  20 093B   Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst revisions going into an earnings report are often a bearish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is TechStockRadar who projects  1 01 EPS and  20 050B in revenue  TechStockRadar is ranked 13th overall among over 4 450 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years TechStockRadar has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue an impressive 66  and 63  of the time respectively throughout 535 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case TechStockRadar expects Home Depot to beat the Estimize consensus on EPS but come up short on sales 
Tuesday morning contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are expecting Home Depot to beat Wall Street s earnings expectations by 1c per share in profit and  969 million dollars in sales  The Estimize community is expecting Home Depot to report earnings growth of 17 cents per share compared to last year and an increase in revenue of 5  on a year over year basis

164494,386010,HD,S P 500  715 Days Since Last 10  Correction,opinion,"The S P 500  CME SPM14  may bend but it rarely breaks    breaks  meaning 10  declines or more  With the last 10  drop from May 1 to June 4  2012  it dropped 10 4  in 25 trading days  Let s face it  the Fed quantitative easing has supplied endless liquidity and is still doing so today  According to Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   5  corrections  typically  happen a few times a year  Every 1 2 years a 10 15  correction will occur and 20  declines happen every 3 5 years  on average 

Runaway train
The popular idea is that when the markets sell off  investors jump on board  Well  for the last two years  there haven t been any real selloffs  We could talk about the Ned Davis S P 500 Price Sales Ratio being higher than ever  but at the end of the day the markets have been overbought and going higher for the last two years 
In fact  many investors we talk to are not even interested in buying a 10  pullback  With the S P up over 180  since making its March 2009 lows  investors continue to be scared of a larger pullback that never seems to happen 
When the markets were selling off during the credit crisis  most people were trying to protect what they had  not add more risk  It took many investors a few years just to figure out where they were  but by that time the markets were already exploding higher  After the beating most investors took  they were reluctant to chase stocks higher only to get burned again 
Waiting for the other shoe to drop
Waiting for a bear market to come along has cost the short sellers a lot of money over the last few years  All the downside  false starts  have done is get big name market timers like Tom DeMark and Doug Kass to put out warnings and recommendations to sell  They have done it so many times it s hard to believe that anyone would pay for their services  Sure  the bear market comparisons will continue  and so will the talk about an 1929  or 1987 style crash but that s not in the cards right now 
Conclusion  Big ugly corrections do happen after a big run up such as the one we experienced in 1987  However  today is not at all like it was in the days leading up to the crash  In fact  nothing I see resembles what we saw in 1987  Our guess is that yet another relatively small pullback is coming and that by the end of 2014 the S P is trading near 2000  not 1400

164495,386011,HD,Employment  The Bite Of Robotics,opinion,"We continue the progression to a robotic workforce  This change is far from uniform  and some companies are better at the transition than others  Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  continues to be in a failure mode 
Follow up 
Walmart has lost control of its stocking systems  
In the early 70 s when companies began the transformation of logistics and warehousing systems   most efforts resulted in failure  It became the norm for the personnel to use a manual  card  system in parallel to the  new  computer system  It should come as no surprise that the  card  system was far more accurate than the computerized one  There are a variety of reasons for this failure   but the biggest reason is that the computer system required the workers to do things unnatural in their work flow  whilst the  card  system was completely integrated in the work flow methodology 
It was not until the late 80 s that I could begin to eliminate the duplicate control  card  systems   as for the first time  based on audit results  that the computer systems were more accurate than the manual ones  At his point  the generally less educated workers responsible for stocking  warehousing  and logistics were better trained  the input methods had been integrated into the workflow  and workers believed the computer was easier to use and more accurate than the manual processes 
Knowing exactly what you have on hand is important  or customers will see shelves filled with what they do not want  and empty spaces for things they want  Welcome to Walmart   
In 2013  the issues of Walmart s logistic failures were    But the problems remain   In the last 30 days  I have encountered 2 failures of their stock   logistics systems   with apologies from Walmart employees saying their system is not reliable   If you lose control of what is on the shelves   you end up with empty shelves  
On the other hand  I continuously use Home Depot s  NYSE HD  system   and its accuracy is frightening  Here is one example of the detail available to consumers online 

CE TECH Low Voltage Recessed Cable Plate   WhiteModel   5018 WH Internet   202689906 Store SKU   640816 4 97   each24 in Stock at  store location deleted by author Aisle37 Bay010

And yes  I went to the store immediately and counted   24 in stock was correct  I began my career as a logistics   material control   warehousing specialist   and I am sensitive to failures or successes in material control processes 
Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  is another success story on automated logistics system   and their   warehouse robotic systems  further enhances their abilities  Yet there are  in the automation   robotic game even for Amazon which likely will drive even further automation   robotics 
No one can accurately forecast the progression of automation    or timeline its effect on employment  In my opinion  the end result will literally be a   But watching this robotic cycle unfolding  the short to medium term effect in the USA may actually be positive   From the  

Companies will be forced to transform or die    claims that up to 47 percent of American jobs are susceptible to robots and automation within the next seven to 10 years 
Despite the doom and gloom  advances in robotics and associated technology are having a positive impact on local manufacturing and services and both sustaining and creating jobs  In developed economies  they have even sparked a trend toward the return of jobs from overseas  or  botsourcing   This new wave of bringing production back home through robotics automation may be the  to India s  118 billion information technology industry  The more processes can be automated  the less it makes sense to outsource activities to countries where labor is less expensive 
The threat is being taken seriously elsewhere in Asia as well  Foxconn  the world s largest contract electronics manufacturer best known for manufacturing the iPhone  has recently announced it will spend  40 million at a new factory in Pennsylvania  using advanced robots and creating 500 jobs 

The USA employment situation has already been decimated by outsourcing and globalization   thanks to the tax system in the USA which favors an imported product over a locally made product  an imported product is not taxed while the USA product is subject to USA taxes in during manufacture   But this cycle has run its course  Due to energy prices increasing the cost of transport  the economic optimum point of production has moved closer to the point of use  In addition  robotics has lowered the cost of manufacture   removing the cost advantage of using foreign labor 
The current robotic dynamics are biased towards bringing manufacturing back to the USA   thus creating more U S  jobs than likely will be eliminated due to robotics  The employment deterioration caused by the globalization took 10 to 15 years to run its course   and hopefully the USA will enjoy 10 to 15 years of positive employment dynamics from robotics to partially reverse the globalization effect

164496,386012,HD,Are Record Levels Of Consumer Credit Dangerous To Your ETF Portfolio ,opinion,"Technology was the best performing sector in the five years prior to the 2000 2002 stock market bear  The acceleration of dot com mania created a boom to bust scenario that few had ever seen  Yet  tech  actually weakened before other segments of the economy  What s more  corporate shares of technology companies witnessed far more violent sell offs than stock shares of other sectors 
Financial corporations led the bull market advance in the five years prior to the 2007 2009 collapse  Questionable underwriting practices fueled a frantic housing balloon  Banks and insurers that had been runaway performers in the uptrend suddenly began to reverse their direction  Indeed  the financial sector actually buckled months in advance of other sectors  Eventually  the drag of financials overwhelmed stocks from every other segment 
The recent past demonstrates that human beings often become too enamored too easily  Investors in the late 1990s were willing to pay exorbitant prices for any company with ties to the Internet  irrespective of revenue and profitability   In the 2000s  people were willing to do anything to acquire property  even if the property cost 40  more to own than to rent 
Granted  the last two bear markets punished the irrational exuberance of individuals as well as entities  It happened in  tech   It happened to lenders and insurers  However  is there any reason to believe that a single sector has gotten so far out of whack that the 2009 2014 bull market might be jeopardized 
If there is a  bubble  this time around  one would have to take a look at consumer credit  Some folks believe that the record levels of credit used to acquire non investment products and services is an indication of confidence  Others feel that stagnation in wage growth coupled with the rapid decline of workers in the workforce is a signal of an unhealthy reliance on credit 
I agree with the latter 
The central bank of the United States  a k a   the Federal Reserve   has been successful in persuading Americans to borrow and spend at exceptionally low interest rates  In fact  the best performing stock sector over the last five years is the consumer discretionary segment  SPDR Select Consumer Discretionary  ARCA XLY  is up roughly 194   far outpacing the next closest performer  SPDR Select Sector Industrials  ARCA XLI  at 155  and SPDR S P 500 Trust   ARCA SPY   up 125  
Indeed  consumer discretionary has led the way in the current bull market  And the increase in consumer credit has had a whole lot to do with it  The question is  would a slide in consumer discretionary share prices be as onerous as the slumps in the aforementioned sector stars  i e   technology  financials  etc   
Probably not 
The consumer may be over leveraged  And consumers may already be pulling back on their purchases  After all  if middle class Americans were genuinely feeling good about the direction of the economy  you would not see so many retailers  e g   Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   PetSmart  NASDAQ PETM   Home Depot  NYSE HD   Lowe s  NYSE LOW   Staples  NASDAQ SPLS   etc   struggling to generate revenue  While one could make the case that tapped out consumers could foreshadow a recession and or bear market in stocks  it would be quite the leap to claim that a  consumer discretionary bubble  will shock the S P for a 50  catastrophe 
Again  U S  consumers have been relying too heavily on credit for their purchases  And ultra low rates may be encouraging the activity  That said  investors can steer around any immediate icebergs by avoiding ETFs like SPDR Select Consumer Discretionary  XLY  and Market Vectors Retail  NYSE RTH  

Whether the smart money is exiting XLY due to overvaluation concerns  fears of a consumer credit bubble  or business cycle rotation  the money is moving just the same  Energy  SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE   typically performs well in the latter stages of a business cycle and it is outperforming most sector funds today  I would attribute some of that outperformance to investors revisiting the emerging market growth story  If you re not a big fan of sector investing  you may want to consider participating in equities via a low volatility investment  For instance  iShares USA Minimum Volatility   NYSE USMV  may not rocket ahead in a raging bull market  but it holds its own nicely during periods of uncertainty

But revolving credit also increased  which indicates that an improving labor market and stock market gains have boosted consumer confidence  This has coincided with higher appliances and furniture sales  indicating an economic recovery Consumer Credit Rises The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System reported yesterday that consumer credit increased by  19 6 billion in May  following a  26 1 billion increase in April  This increase in the indicator of potential future spending levels was more than the consensus estimate of an increase by  17 5 billion  Consumer credit increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7 50   Non revolving credit increased at an annual rate of 9 25   Revolving credit rose at an annual rate of 2 50  Home Sales Surge The basis for the revival of home furnishings and building materials is the fact that housing data itself is on the positive side  Sales of new single family houses increased 18 6  from April s revised rate of 425 000 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504 000 in May  New home sales for the month of May increased to the highest level in six years  Existing home sales rose 4 9  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 89 million in May from an upwardly revised 4 66 million in April  This was also the fastest pace of increase in seven months  The pending home sales index  a forward looking indicator based on contract signings  went up 6 1  to 103 9 in May  Further  May s 6 1  increase turned out to be the largest month over month gain since April 2010  It also touched the highest level in eight months The Silver Lining of Retail Sales The U S  Department of Commerce reported that seasonally adjusted sales of retail and food services rose 0 3  in March  less than the previous month s gains of 0 5   This rise in retail sales in May was also less than the consensus estimate of an increase of 0 6   Excluding motor vehicles sales  retail sales increased 0 1   less than the consensus estimate of a 0 4  increase

164525,386041,HD,The Headline Data That Financial Media Ignored On Wednesday,opinion,Wednesday was a wild trading session where we saw the largest intraday selloff in the S P 500 E Mini futures that we have seen in some time  Intraday price action was driven largely by statements made by Chairman Bernanke and the release of the Federal Reserve Meeting Minutes which saw some monster intraday moves and a large spike in the Volatility Index  VIX  While the world is focused on when the Federal Reserve is going to taper their Quantitative Easing program and the impact those actions will have on financial markets  I wanted to look at another divergence in the economic data which is supported by market action Instead of trying to determine how or when the Federal Reserve will taper or end their monetary experiment  I wanted to juxtapose statements that were made today with the actual facts  Readers can draw their own conclusions Recently  we have been told that the housing market is in the early stages of recovery  Unfortunately due to low interest rates housing has turned back into a speculative market  Consequently  a lot of so called fast money is flowing into housing which in many cases is either being purchased for rentals or by foreign investors as a speculative investment At present the housing market is not being driven by capital formation at the household level and data indicates that construction jobs are under pressure and affordability is reversing  The chart below illustrates what has recently transpired in the 10 Year Treasury Yield As can be seen above  the 10 Year Treasury yield has risen considerably since the beginning of the month of May  Normally when interest rates are rising and Federal Reserve policy is indicating that a form of tightening seems likely we typically see a rush of mortgage applications and home starts as borrowers try to lock in lower interest rates  Furthermore  the spring and early summer months are generally considered a very favorable time to sell existing homes in the United States In light of all of the above mentioned facts paired with our Federal Reserve Chairman stating that housing is starting to recover  readers would expect that housing starts and mortgage applications would be jumping higher Unfortunately the mortgage application data came out on a day when the Federal Reserve was controlling the headlines  The mortgage application data indicated the largest 2 week rate of decline in mortgage applications since the housing bubble popped Furthermore  this is supposed to be a strong seasonal time for real estate and interest rates are rising as shown above  If readers look at recent price action in the Spiders Homebuilders ETF  XHB  or Home Depot  HD  it would appear that all is well in the land of housing and Chairman Bernanke and the Federal Reserve are spot on with their bullish analysis Until the past few trading sessions  the homebuilders have been in an obvious bullish run to the upside  The rally that transpired since the late February 2013 lows tacked on close to 20  gains in XHB  However  as noted above  the past few trading sessions  price action appears to have stagnated and we saw new recent lows on Wednesday Home Depot  HD  is another stock that relies heavily on home construction and improvement and would likely benefit from both new home building and existing home purchases which typically require immediate customization or improvements  The recent price action in Home Depot is shown below Home Depot has had an impressive rally since the beginning of 2013  HD has tacked on over 20 points on its share price representing a near 30  move higher year to date  However  exuberance on Tuesday after earnings were released saw a spike Wednesday morning which was promptly reversed intraday Based on the recent price action in both the homebuilders ETF  XHB  and Home Depot  HD  readers would tend to agree with Chairman Bernanke that housing was recovering and that the recent mortgage application decline was merely  transitory  However  there is one eye opening concern that does not support Chairman Bernanke s position about a housing recovery and unfortunately points to less demand in the immediate future  While many investors do not track lumber prices  the chart below demonstrates the sheer bear market that has befallen lumber futures prices As can be seen above  random length lumber futures have gotten crushed to the downside over the past two months  In early March  lumber futures were trading up around the 410 price point  At the close on Wednesday  random length lumber futures closed at 305 20  a more than 25  drop in price in roughly 2 months How is housing rebounding with lumber prices falling  While Home Depot sells many products  most major remodeling projects and even smaller upgrades require the purchase of lumber  Have logging companies discovered an untapped lumber resource I will let readers decide whether to believe the price of lumber and mortgage application data or a Federal Reserve Chairman that declared on January 10  2008 that  The Federal Reserve is not currently forecasting a recession  For those paying attention  the macroeconomic data is crumbling in the United States and Europe  The printing press and monstrous liquidity can only fuel markets for so long  Can Chairman Bernanke and the Federal Reserve print Cap EX spending increases and rising profitability  I think we all know the answer  In the end  when the Federal Reserve is printing  85 billion dollars per month to buy U S  government debt perhaps fundamentals are largely irrelevant ,2013-05-24,J.W.

164552,386068,HD,Will The Worst Sentiment Reading Since 12 2011 Rattle Consumer ETFs ,opinion,What does it mean when we learn that consumer sentiment drops to the lowest level since 12 2011  For the bulls  it means that any setback in consumer  feelings  will be offset by the Federal Reserve s easy money policy  that is  the Fed will not quit its bond buying  interest rate lowering until exceptional employment prospects spur greater consumption For the bears  however  many believe the writing for a substantive sell off is on the  Wall   In spite of the fact that SPDR Select Consumer Discretionary  XLY  and SPDR Select Consumer Staples  XLP  have been notching high after all time high  both fell further on 3 15 2013 than most of the other key sector ETFs Naturally  bulls regard the slight selling pressure as little more than a knee jerk reaction  They are also pointing to the fact that what consumers feel  sentiment  often does not correspond to what they do with their money Not surprisingly  the bearish guidance involves a  Sell in April and Avoid a Pain Pill  opportunity  They contend that Q1 2013 earnings will show the adverse effects of the lower take home pay that began at the start of the year  And the bears decry that the automatic spending cuts that began last month will inevitably reduce government jobs  they believe the numbers will look dismal in the March and April labor stats It may be beneficial to take a longer term view of Consumer Discretionary  XLY  to take a quick respite from the bull bear debate  Over the last decade  then  what can we learn about the performance of XLY relative to the broader S P 500 benchmark The chart above is incredibly intriguing  The most obvious thing that pops out is the fact that an unwavering faith in the strength of the U S  consumer resulted in a total return that was 50   5000 basis points  greater than buying n holding the benchmark  On the surface  this would seem unassailable proof that the consumer sector has its advantages  Yet the first 6 years of the decade showed little difference in performance whatsoever  In fact  due to the housing collapse  the downside slide in consumer spending began first with XLY during the 2007 2009 stock market crisis  Still  the end result after 6 years was decidedly similar  So if our current 4 year bull market tells us anything  it tells us the power of the Fed s quantitative easing  that is  if the central bank is able to keep interest rates below free market levels   if government powers can create an environment where consumers will borrow to buy home appliances  cars and 54 inch TVs   consumer oriented companies can crush earnings expectations  Better earnings result in higher stock prices  higher stock prices fuel momentum and even higher stock prices  There s only one problem with the idea that funds like Vanguard Consumer Discretionary  VCR  or SPDR Select Consumer Discretionary  XLY  are unbreakable  The problem  Reversion to the mean  History teaches us time and again that outperforming sectors become underperforming sectors and vice versa  In this case  XLY s stratospheric rise over the last 4 years is likely to revert back to the mean performance of the S P 500  Right now  that s a fairly depressing pullback  Nevertheless  don t expect Consumer ETFs to flounder overnight  Since its remarkable success is largely tied to the low interest rates that consumers have enjoyed   since the Fed isn t going to let rate increases harm a perception that employment GDP progress is just around the bend   Consumer ETFs should be able to hold their own  If you re worried about rising rates  however  you might consider diversifying in the space  Market Vectors Retail  RTH  diversifies between defensive toilet paper and tooth paste stocks as well discretionary spending at Amazon  AMZN  and Home Depot  HD   iShares Global Consumer Staples  KXI  diversifies 50   like Unilever  UL  and Nestle  NSRGF   Disclosure  Gary Gordon  MS  CFP is the president of Pacific Park Financial  Inc   a Registered Investment Adviser with the SEC  Gary Gordon  Pacific Park Financial  Inc  and or its clients may hold positions in the ETFs  mutual funds  and or any investment asset mentioned above  The commentary does not constitute individualized investment advice  The opinions offered herein are not personalized recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities  At times  issuers of exchange traded products compensate Pacific Park Financial  Inc  or its subsidiaries for advertising at the ETF Expert web site  ETF Expert content is created independently of any advertising relationships ,2013-03-17,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-worst-sentiment-reading-since-12-2011-rattle-consumer-etfs-159224,159224
164574,386090,HD,ETFs That May Get A Lift From The U S s Snowstorm Nemo,opinion,Investing in stock assets when the S P 500 is hitting fresh highs can be as dangerous as driving on a yet to be plowed stretch of highway  You may get to your destination without a hitch  Then again  you might spin out of control and crash  At present  both the  and  Snowmageddon  on the East Coast are likely to have an adverse impact on U S  economic growth  It follows that a blind allocation in a blizzard is ill advised  Traditionally  clean up efforts have been beneficial to corporations like Home Depot and Lowe s  Reconstruction endeavors have also been positive for the homebuilders  In theory  you may even see a jolt to the automakers if enough cars are destroyed by Superstorm Nemo  There s little reason to doubt that repairs and rebuilding will occur after the snowfall stops  On the other hand  homebuilders and automakers have already had a remarkable run  Indeed  it may be more sensible to pursue beneficiaries that have not pole vaulted quite as high over the previous 3 6 months  For example  according to the Automobile Association of America  AAA   the price of retail gas has rocketed 30 cents in the last month alone  By way of comparison  natural gas prices have been tame  If one accepts the idea that a snowstorm of the projected magnitude is likely to push heating costs higher  and if one looks at residential heating oil prices outpacing retail gasoline over the previous 8 winters  it is reasonable to anticipate bigger profits for the natural gas producers  Enter First Trust Natural Gas  FCG   Whereas the Dow and the S P 500 have risen way above the highs of September 2012  FCG is still recovering  Only recently has this exchange traded tracker of natural gas companies climbed back above a long term 200 day trendline Another motif that may have traction is the increased usage of the Internet and social media during superstorms  It happened during Hurricane Sandy in October  And whether one employs  hashtags  on Twitter  or seeks guidance at Facebook  Linked In or Google  there is plenty of reason to expect larger than life traffic volume  online retailers also stand to gain Unfortunately  Global X Social Media  SOCL  has already experienced a super sized jump off its November lows  It also has an enormous 13  weight in Facebook  which might increase volatility in your portfolio  I would prefer First Trust Technology AlphaDex Fund  FXL   which boasts a wider distribution across tech companies as well as a stock selection methodology based largely upon fundamental value Finally  a snowstorm  even one as severe as Nemo  may not be as threatening to the insurance industry as hurricanes or earthquakes  And Sandy did little to deter people from betting heavily on financial company gains On the flip side  the frequency of weather related events may undermine the ability for insurance companies to accurately underwrite  If they cannot accurately assess probability of loss  insurers may experience smaller profits  either due to an unwillingness to write policies or due to a substantial uptick in claims If you are an aggressive trader  you might consider shorting SPDR KBW Insurance  KIE   The fund is severely overbought as evidenced by Relative Strength Index  RSI  readings consistently over 70  the ETF itself is more than 15 3  above a 200 day moving average  Disclosure  Gary Gordon  MS  CFP is the president of Pacific Park Financial  Inc   a Registered Investment Adviser with the SEC  Gary Gordon  Pacific Park Financial  Inc  and or its clients may hold positions in the ETFs  mutual funds  and or any investment asset mentioned above  The commentary does not constitute individualized investment advice  The opinions offered herein are not personalized recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities  At times  issuers of exchange traded products compensate Pacific Park Financial  Inc  or its subsidiaries for advertising at the ETF Expert web site  ETF Expert content is created independently of any advertising relationships ,2013-02-10,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/etfs-that-may-get-a-lift-from-the-u.s's-snowstorm-nemo-154592,154592
164575,386091,HD,Is Tampa Pension Fund Manager The Real Deal  ,opinion,Some managers are  Jay Bowen s stock picking has made the Tampa Firefighters and Police Officers Pension Fund one of the best performing public pensions in the U S  As of December 31  Mr  Bowen s annual returns beat pension giant Calpers which employs 125 consultants and 1 100 money managers over three year  five year and 10 year spans  The Tampa fund appears to be well funded at about 90   It uses an unusually high annual investment target and discount rate of 10  to calculate the present value of benefits owed to retirees  The fact that a particular manager has generated above average returns over the past 10 years is not an anomaly  but rather  a statistical certainty  Given Tampa discounts their liabilities by 10   implying an expected return of 7  or so  I suspect that statistical logic isn t their strong suit  so they simply see this case in isolation  and infer his return based on what looks to them like a long track record  over ten years  As the housing bubble showed  you can t argue against someone who has outperformed over the past 10 years  so I m sure they are going with their rosy assumption  which I bet will fail with a high probability  This reminds me of a sales pitch a neighbor broker once told me about  He would take his clients to lunch or dinner  and tell them a long  happy tail about an old client of his firm who had simply put away a modest amount in a company they recommended for over 20 years  and by the time she retired  she had tens of millions of dollars and spent most of her time on charity  This fantasy was very appealing because it really happened  as Home Depot was one of those stocks that went up 100 fold over its lifetime  Further  doling out charity is a great way to enjoy high status in your golden years without guilt  it s something the non rich simply can t do or criticize  Of course  for every lady like this  there were thousands who didn t do nearly as well  but only a cynic would conclude such cases were impossible ,2013-03-13,Eric Falkenstein,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-tampa-pension-fund-manager-the-real-deal-158767,158767

increases of over  600 billion would be implemented  and the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  has concluded that such a scenario would push the economy into recession next year  The CBO has also forecasted that the unemployment rate would jump to 9 1  by the end of 2013 if the automatic cuts in spending occur U S  share markets continue to trade in very subdued conditions  erasing earlier

164670,386186,HD,Is America The Most Materialistic Society In The History Of The World ,opinion,When it comes to materialism  has any nation ever surpassed what we are seeing in the United States right now  We define our lives by how much stuff we have  to a large degree our personal and business relationships are defined by how much money we make  and even most of the important dates on our calendar are all about materialism  Just think about it  We throw outrageous birthday parties for our kids and we shower them with gifts  Most of our  holidays  have become highly materialistic  and the biggest holiday of all in our society  Christmas  is an absolute orgy of materialism  We make lists of the    and we glorify their achievements  We spend most of our time either making money or spending it  Even the phrase  the American Dream  reveals how materialistic we are  When most people are asked what  the American Dream  is  they start talking about a house  a car  vacations  retirement  sending your kids to college  etc  The American Dream has become all about money and stuff  Sadly  no matter how big our homes are and no matter how many shiny new toys we accumulate  we never seem to be happy  We always want more  and we always seem to be willing to go into more debt to get it  We are the most materialistic society in the history of the world  and our endless greed is going to end up swallowing us alive  When it comes to materialism in America  there are outrageous examples all around us  but one of my favorite examples is the     It is a Tumblr blog of photos from Instagram of young Americans showing off how they are enjoying the vast wealth of their parents  The following is how  describes the blog     The controversial new Tumblr is a collection of snapshots from the photo sharing site that depicts the children of wealth and privilege   summering in the Hamptons  lounging on yachts and posing by their luxury cars  One does a back flip out of a helicopter near St  Tropez  Others snap pictures of their restaurant bills   allegedly paying thousands of dollars for lobster  champagne and high end liquor  In the warm patina of the Instagram  the youngsters appear to be living over the top lifestyles   and enjoying every moment   Our everyday is better than your best day   reads one caption  a bit tauntingly  And   Do you have a horse in your backyard  Didn t think so   But just because you have a horse on your property does that make your life better than the rest of our lives  Of course not  Wealth does not equal happiness  Unfortunately  however  most Americans have totally bought into this lie  Most Americans believe that more money equals a better life  In response to  the Rich Kids of Instagram   the Huffington Post recently put together a piece entitled    that features photos of cats as they  model upscale accessories  lounge with bottles of champagne  sail on yachts and ponder life while relaxing atop piles of money   Of course a lot of those pictures are quite funny  but they also reveal a deep truth about our society  We have spent our lives chasing after the almighty dollar thinking that it will make us happy  Study after study has shown that we tend to link wealth and happiness  The following is from a recent  about one of those studies     Many parents already know older children can be materialistic  Some tweens not only want the latest games and clothes  but also think owning these things will bring them happiness  friends and popularity  And marketers are eager to get them to buy  Tweens spend  28 billion a year  not including the more than  200 billion their parents spend on them  according to market research company C R Research    But even though we have an incredibly high standard of living compared to most of the rest of the world  are most of us actually happy  No way  In fact  Americans take more anti depressants than anyone else on the planet  It is really easy to get caught up in materialism though  Let me share an example from my own life  Several months ago our old truck completely died  Instead of pouring thousands of more dollars into fixing it  we decided that we would get another used truck  So the other day I stopped by a dealership while my wife was grabbing some things from Home Depot  The salesperson started showing me some of the used trucks on the lot  but after a while I suggested that he show me some of the new trucks that were sitting on the other side of the lot  Before I knew it  I was sitting in the most expensive truck on the lot and he was showing me all of the cool features it had  And I have to admit   for a few moments there I was really enamored with that truck  It was the coolest truck that I had ever seen in my life  Of course my wife and I don t need a truck like that  We only need to haul stuff around a few times a month  And we certainly do not need the amount of debt that it would take to buy such a truck  But for a few moments there I really wanted it  The pull of materialism can be very strong  So would that truck have  changed my life  or brought me lasting happiness  Of course not  It would have brought some thrills for the first couple of days  but after a while it would just be sitting in the garage taking up space just like any other truck would  So did I end up buying a truck  Not yet  But we need one soon  My wife has been without a truck for quite a few months now and she is getting impatient  But whether we get a nice used truck or a used truck that has one foot in the grave  it really isn t going to change our lives much  In the end  our lives should not be defined by what we own or by how much money we have in the bank  But how do we refer to ourselves in this day and age  The American people are called  consumers  and the truth is that we consume far more than anyone else on the globe does  Just look at our eating habits  Of all the major industrialized nations  America is   The next time you go into a store  take note of how many people are overweight  It has not always been this way  Back in 1962   of all Americans were obese  But now overeating is a national sport  At this point  approximately  of all Americans are obese  and it is being projected that number will rise to  by 2030  While we are gorging ourselves with food  what else do we like to do  That s right   we love to watch television  In fact  the average American watches  of television every single week  We have become completely and totally addicted to entertainment  and we have become trained to be constantly  plugged in  to something  Our lives have become all about constantly feeding our greed and our selfishness  In fact  that is a major reason for the breakdown of the family in America  We tend to view marriage as a temporary condition that can be quickly discarded when it no longer makes us happy  Sadly  the United States has the highest  in the world by a very wide margin at this point  In addition  more Americans than ever are putting off marriage these days  Young Americans are being told that  an education  and  a career  are more important  According to the Pew Research Center  only  of all American adults are currently married  Back in 1960   of all adults in America were married  As a result of these factors  we are an incredibly lonely nation  Today  the United States has the highest percentage of  on the entire globe  In order to fill the void  the American people turn to things that will numb the pain  American use  than anyone else on the planet and they also use  than anyone else on the planet  We have more  stuff  than any other society in the history of the world has ever had  but it has not made us happy  And how did we pay for all of this  We paid for a lot of this with debt  In fact  we have accumulated the biggest mountain of debt in the history of the world  During my lifetime  the debt of the U S  government has gotten more than 30 times larger  For much more on this  please see my previous article entitled     But the federal government is not the only one with a debt problem  The truth is that our entire society is absolutely drowning in debt  Over the past 50 years  the total amount of debt in the U S  has grown from less than a trillion dollars to nearly 55 trillion dollars     We have used massive amounts of debt in an attempt to feed our endless greed and materialism and we have gotten ourselves into a whole lot of trouble  This is one of the reasons why I write  I want people to understand how bad things have really gotten  Thanks to our foolishness  our economy has been declining  it is going to continue to decline  and a massive  is coming  Some people believe that this is a message of  doom and gloom   but that is not the case at all  Sticking our heads in the sand and pretending that somehow everything is going to be just fine is not going to do anyone any good  Instead  I believe that warning people about the coming economic collapse is a message of hope  There is hope in understanding what is happening  developing a plan to deal with it  and preparing yourself and your family for the storm that is coming  It is the people that are ignoring all of the warnings that are going to be in real trouble  Millions upon millions of people will be absolutely blindsided by what is coming  Many will give in to total despair once they realize that their prosperity is gone and they have done nothing to prepare for what they are now facing  My hope is that the information that I write about will be shocking enough that it will wake people up and motivate them to  so that they can handle the incredibly challenging years that are ahead  And the truth is that our lives should not be about our money and our stuff anyway  Your possessions are just temporary  None of them are going to last forever and you certainly cannot take them with you when you die  Even though our economy has had some rough times  we still have a higher standard of living than 99 percent of the humans that have ever lived on this planet have had  You would think that would be enough for us  But it isn t  We have hoarded our wealth and we have lived in luxury and self indulgence  When our debt fueled prosperity disappears  most Americans are not going to know how to handle it  Most Americans will believe that their lives are  over  at that point  But those that are not caught up in materialism and that have prepared for what is ahead will understand that the next chapters of their lives can be the greatest chapters of all ,2012-09-20,Michael T.

164671,386187,HD,Small Businesses Disagree With BLS,opinion,Since the release of the most recent BLS Employment Situation Report  which showed an astounding drop in the unemployment rate  I have spent a good bit of time dissecting the release and discussing why the real unemployment rate is really between 17  and 22  depending on how you calculate it   See  and   However  today s release of the September NFIB Small Business Survey shows the extent to which the current BLS employment calculation method may have detached from reality From the NFIB report   September was another month of low expectations and pessimism for the small business community  with the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index losing 0 1 points and falling to 92 8  The recession level reading was pulled down by a deterioration in labor market indicators  with job creation plans plunging 6 points  job openings falling one point and more firms reporting decreases in employment than those reporting increases in employment  Since the commencement of NFIB s monthly surveys in 1986  the Index has been below 93 0 a total of 56 times  32 of which have occurred since the recovery began in June 2009  The detachment between the real economy  and that reported by the government  continues to exasperate the best laid plans of the Department of Central Planning  aka the Fed   As reported the NFIB small business survey has remained mired at recessionary levels since statistical end of the last recession in 2009 The ongoing problem remains  poor sales   which is the driver for all other business actions from increased capital expenditures to future employment  From the report   Weak sales continue to be an albatross for the small business community  The net percent of all owners  seasonally adjusted  reporting higher nominal sales over the past three months was unchanged at a negative 13   cementing the 17 point decline since April and affirming weak GDP growth for the second quarter  Twenty one  21   percent still cite weak sales as their top business problem    historically high  but down from the record 34  reached in March 2010  Seasonally unadjusted  23  of all owners reported higher sales  last three months compared to prior three months  down one point  and 30  reported lower sales  up one point   Consumer spending remains weak and high energy costs continue to  tax  consumer disposable income  The net percent of owners expecting higher real sales was unchanged at one percent of all owners  seasonally adjusted   down 11 points from the year high of net 12  in February  The weak reading is unlikely to trigger orders for new inventory or business expansion  Not seasonally adjusted  24  expect improvement over the next three months  down four points  and 31  expect declines  up three points   The chart below shows capital expenditure plans versus future expectations about the economy  The importance here is that companies are primarily spending on maintenance of plants  property and equipment rather than expansion and upgrades  In the most recent report only 34  reported spending on new equipment which was down seven points from August  Only 16  acquired vehicles    a decline of five points  and just 14  improved or expanded facilities which remained unchanged from the previous report  Overall  there was a substantial reduction in capital spending activity with the percent of owners planning capital outlays in the next three to six months falling three points to 21  If employment was surging as reported by the BLS in the last month these numbers should be rising as employers expend capital to boost production  Furthermore  if business were hiring as strongly as reported then the number of business owners who think that this is a  good time to expand  their businesses should be much higher than 7  which is just 50  of where it stood just prior to the last recession The disconnect between the BLS s employment survey which showed an increase of 574 000 non farm payrolls in September  114 000 after revisions  versus the NFIB which showed fewer jobs in September only adds further fuel to the debate  If the BLS report was correct then the NFIB report should be showing an increase in employment  However  the survey showed that not only have firms not hired in the last month but only 10  plan to increase employment at their firm in the next three months  This is down a full three points from the last report while 11  plan employment reductions  two points higher than last month  as well  On a seasonally adjusted the net percent of owners planning to create new jobs fell six points to 4  which is historically a very weak reading especially during an economic recovery Essentially  current levels of hiring are just keeping up with population growth  but not exceeding it  As discussed    a look at full time employment relative to civilian the population shows that this is indeed the case   Unlike the traditional employment metrics used by the BLS which have been adjusted to obfuscate the real employment situation   the level of full time employment relative to the total population accounts for the movements into  and out of  the workforce  This calculation provides a better barometer of the economic health of the country   The reality is that by this measure the real employment situation is running close to its worst levels since 1968 There is really not much wonder as to why there has been such a lash back against the recent BLS jobs report over the last few days  This time  however  it has picked up high profile figures such as GE s former boss Jack Welch who tweeted just after the release on Friday   Unbelievable jobs numbers     these Chicago guys will do anything     can t debate so change numbers  and Ken Langone  founder of Home Depot  also chimed in on  saying   Damn it  these numbers don t make sense  However  it is not just the NFIB report that is showing lower levels of job creation that run counter to that of the BLS  Each month we update the STA Composite Employment Index which is an index of the employment subcomponents of the Chicago Fed National Activity Index  Chicago ISM  several regional Fed manufacturing indexes  ISM surveys and the NFIB report  As you can clearly see in the chart below not only has the four month average of the employment index deteriorated in the last month    it has fallen for six months straight from its peak in March of 26 46 to 18 42 today  A reading below 20 has normally been indicative of a recessionary economy No matter how you look at the data there is a clear disconnect between the BLS report and economic realities  From the NFIB s point view it is  economic uncertainty  that weighs on business owners and keeps them on the defensive  The actions by the Federal Reserve to buy bonds and inject liquidity into the financial system does not solve the problem of  poor sales   reduce regulations that strangle growth or solve the  fiscal cliff  issues that threaten business profitability by the end of the year Bill Dunkleberg from the NFIB sums it up best   Politicians have little understanding of the costs their actions impose on the private sector   Frequent changes in the tax code  should not consistently rank in the top 15 problems that owners face  ,2012-10-09,Lance

164673,386189,HD,Romney Gains  Welch Doubts And Gold Pauses ,opinion,In the wake of the debate last week Mitt Romney closed the gap with Barack Obama successfully making the election a statistical tie  While Obama leads by a point in many polls  Romney leads in some and the momentum is decidedly in his favor  The President will need a great performance from Vice President Biden in the upcoming vice presidential debate against challenger Paul Ryan While some pundits offered Wild Joe s experience and Mr  Ryan s likely deference to Biden s seniority as an advantage  I think the youngster comes intellectually armed and oratorically dangerous to push Biden back on his heels  Biden is likely to get ruffled and aggressive and given his recent public gaffe s I suspect this will be a much more entertaining event than even Romney Obama  Those Chicago Guys A big benefit to Obama s re election campaign was last weeks unemployment number  Roundly criticized as inconsistent with other measures of the economy it was Jack Welch  former GE chief  that made the biggest headlines Friday when he Tweeted that  those Chicago guys  will do anything to swing the campaign  Implying that the numbers were falsified in order to make political gain is a questionable decision  one which could harm Mr  Welch as much as point out the disparity Many economists however agreed that the number was odd  given that it did not jive with expectations nor other measures of employment  The U 6 number  the measure which includes underemployed part time and discouraged workers  did not budge  The headline rate dropped from 8 1  to 7 8   a big move and the lowest the unemployment rate has been since January 2009 the month Obama took office  It is suspiciously low and many economists are still analyzing the data to figure it out Jack Welch got support this week from Donald Trump and Ken Langone  the Home Depot founder  Both men agree with Welch  Good for Welch  Trump is never one to shy away from publicity and Langone has long been critical of Obama  Trump was keen to predict that the number will likely be adjusted up  after the election   after Obama wins  I concur  Conspiracy or not  the number will be adjusted and the real unemployment rate is higher than 7 8  Frankly  7 8  unemployment stinks anyway  But it makes a great story for Obama  Listen to me  it took four years  but unemployment is now below where George W  Bush left it  Poor George  He ll remain Obama s go to excuse even if he wins reelection Muddled And ConfusedGold remains muddled in confusion and is likely to remain so until after the election  After peaking last Thursday at a multi month high  gold  represented by the SPDR Gold Trust ETF  NYSE  GLD  in the chart below  has been sliding back a little  The previous two similar peaks  February 2012 and November 2011  present a bit of a resistance level  which is cause for concern  The last time GLD traded meaningfully above these peaks was when it hit its all time high in August 2011 Watch For ResistanceI am keeping my eyes on those levels  Further resistance can trigger a sell off of a good 10  quite easily  I do think gold will move higher from here  however  even after a 10  draw down And I am in good company as many analysts and pundits are predicting   2000 gold  I read  2400 by the end of 2013 recently   Volatility will be the key  especially if the economy worsens  In that circumstance  gold will likely get spanked as a  risk asset  first and then fled to as a  safe haven  second  the net result will be higher prices  Stay tuned   ,2012-10-10,Steven P.

164698,386214,HD,Housing Starts To Disappoint ,opinion,It s hard to make much of the long term housing starts chart relative to the number to be reported for May later today  with consensus expectations of about 720K  but it is pretty clear that the long term sideways trend was broken to the downside and it is the downtrend in housing starts over the last few years that must be respected  This is true even whether that small and confirmed Double Bottom works to bring housing starts back up closer to 800k or whether it turns out to be some sort of Bear Pennant for a potential disaster in housing ahead with the downtrend emphasized by the latter possibility and one that should be considered carefully with the potential for a 15 25  decline ahead in the CSI   There are other charts  however  that may be reflecting what will be reported today and those are  not surprisingly  homebuilding related securities that include the S P Homebuilders ETF  XHB  along with the very gamey Hovenanian  HOV  and the more staid Lennar Corp   LEN   Starting out with the catch all XHB that includes the likes of Home Depot  HD  and Lowes  LOW  as well  it is showing a confirmed Rising Wedge that suggests XHB is unlikely to take its 50 DMA out for any time too long considering a target of  12 16   In weekly form  the Descending Trend Channel comprised of Bear Wedges presents as a Symmetrical Triangle that is more prone to a downside break  but let s treat both sides with the bullish scenario confirming at  21 53 for a target of  24 13 while the bearish side confirms at  18 93 for a target of  16 33 and a level that supports the Rising Wedge    Put most simply  XHB is trading in a topping pattern of some sort that should bring it down toward  16 at a minimum with resistance around the top trendline of that Descending Trend Channel providing reason to think the bearish catalyst could come today  in part  on what may be a disappointing housing starts number   Interestingly  the charts of HOV   and not a component of the XHB   support that conclusion with a gross Rising Wedge showing in the weekly chart for a target of  1 52 and a level that is supported by a Spike Top and a downside gap in the daily chart   The Spike Top speaks to a possibly disappointing housing starts number as well considering it is ready to confirm right away at  2 44 for a target of  2 11 while the gap will try to bring HOV down to about  1 70 and a level that may make this name interesting from a technical perspective   Right now  though  HOV looks like XHB along with LEN  Pulte Group  PHM  and Toll Brothers  TOL  even though HOV s chart is showing somewhat different technicals than those names with the real similarity coming from the likelihood for a move to the downside in the very near term   It is for this similarity and a likely move down in the homebuilding sector that provides good reason to think housing starts for May will disappoint when reported later today ,2012-06-19,Abigail Doolittle,https://www.investing.com/analysis/housing-starts-to-disappoint-126892,126892
164699,386215,HD,Alpha Hunters  Investing In Urban Communities ,opinion,In 1800 only 2  of the world population  which was just 970 million in total  was urbanized  By 1950 that figure had grown to 30   and by 2030 it is estimated that more than 60  of the world s population  around 5 billion people  will live in towns and cities  Currently in excess of 193 000 people are added to the urban population every day  more than 2 each second While much attention is given to the urbanization of the developing world  similar trends have been occurring in the developed countries which have profound economic and social effects  The 2010 US Census showed that America s urban population increased 12 1  from 2000 2010  against a national population growth rate of around 9 7    Almost 80  of the US population now live in urban areas In the developed and developing world  urban communities are synonymous with contrast  they contain some of the densest pockets of wealth and poverty together with huge diversities in ethnic groups  languages  cultures  economies and more  They are seething masses of humanity with a mix of social issues and opportunities  and we are only just beginning to understand them To learn more about urban communities and the investment case they present  I spoke to K  Robert  Bobby  Turner  Chairman  CEO   Co Founding Partner of Canyon Partners   Canyon Partners and its affiliates  including Canyon Capital Advisors  Canyon Capital Realty Advisors and ICE Canyon  are investment management firms and registered investment advisers headquartered in Los Angeles  California  with approximately  19 billion in assets under management Bobby Turner is Chairman  CEO and Co Founding Partner of Canyon Capital Realty Advisors  LLC  CCRA  and a Partner of Canyon Partners  LLC  Canyon  Mr  Turner has been a pioneer over the past decade in the area of  triple bottom line  investing   an investment philosophy of providing sound financial returns for investors  fostering opportunities for residents of the communities in which it invests  and embracing environmental responsibility  These funds include the Canyon Johnson Urban Funds  a series of closed end real estate funds and joint venture with Earvin  Magic  Johnson  focusing on inner city and urban real estate development  and the Canyon Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund  a joint venture with Andre Agassi focusing on the development of learning friendly  environmentally responsible charter school facilities for best in class charter school operatorsMr  Turner serves on the Advisory Board of the Virginia Avenue Project  a Los Angeles based not for profit organization providing after school services for inner city and at risk youths  and on the Board of Directors of the Pacific Charter School Development Corporation  a Los Angeles based not for profit organization focused on providing under served California students with high quality charter school facilities  Mr  Turner also serves on the board of the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City  ICIC   a national not for profit organization founded in 1994 to promote a market based approach and cutting edge solutions for inner city revitalization  Mr  Turner is an active member of the International Council of Shopping Centers  ICSC   the Pension Real Estate Association  PREA   and the Urban Land Institute  ULI   He is a graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania  B S   Finance  where he and his wife have endowed a curriculum development fund and speaker series for social impact studies  and where he serves on the University s Undergraduate Executive Board of Advisors Q  What is the rationale behind urban development and urban investing  K  Robert  Bobby  Turner  Investing in urban communities  education and infrastructure are essential for the future of our culture and society  They are also incredibly smart investments  Often people view them as social or impact investments  I hate that moniker because it assumes or implies a reduction in yield  I typically think impact investing  on the whole  can generate better risk adjusted yields than the alternatives If one wants to treat societal problems  then philanthropy and government spending are fine  If one wants to cure societal problems  one has got to come up with sustainable solutions  and that means attracting for profit capital Q  What is the economic role and impact of urban communities  K  Robert  Bobby  Turner  America s urban markets represent 75  of our population  68  of jobs but only 12  of the nation s land mass Some people think of urban as only the inner core impoverished  others include the first ring suburbs  Urban can be poor  urban can be rich  To me  urban is defined by density and diversity  Urban is an opportunity    I have not been an urban investor in re gentrification  which tries to change the character of a community and  candidly  is very speculative  Instead I look at revitalisation  which constitutes investing in existing densely populated and ethnically diverse communities and delivering the goods and services that are sought after but not provided  You are not trying to create demand  but rather aim to fulfill unmet demand Q  What is your investment mandate     K  Robert  Bobby  Turner  It s very easy to invest money  all you have to do is hit send on your wire instructions   In our business you are held accountable on getting your money back with a return thereon  The primary job of a good investor is to do three things   Identify  Quantify and Mitigate Risks   In most investment theses one of the risks you always identify and quantify but struggle to mitigate is the risk of demand   If you build something  if you create a product  if you have a service  is there a consumer base out there  In most cases  entrepreneurs take the risk to create demand  or hope that demand will come to them We have a  6 D s  approach D1   Density of Population   There has to be at least 250 000 of a reasonable radiusD2   Diversity   That s where the opportunity is  The emerging  overlooked  misunderstood minority communities   Traditional capital does not come from those communities and hence does not have comfort investing in those communities D3   Demand   I m not looking to try and create demand   I need to empirically prove to myself that there is a tremendous wait list for the goods and services I m looking to provide D4   Developer   Real estate is a cottage industry  a local industry   You may have gone to the best business in the world and learned that the three most important things in real estate are location  location  location  but it s just not true  It s relationship  relationship  relationship D5    De Leadership   I know it s not proper English but you simply don t want to invest in communities that aren t characterised by strong  supportive leadership that embrace partners  We actively shop marketplaces for opportunities with strong city  mayoral and community support D6   Doing Good   We believe that by being open  honest and transparent with communities  they are more likely to protect  respect and patronis\ze our projects   We work as a double bottom line investor   Our primary responsibility and obligation to make money for our investors   That however  is not mutually exclusive to making positive change   In fact  they are synergistic and by being socially impactful  you can reduce the risk We don t have a specific mandate in terms of what we invest in  Our aim is broad reaching  what does the community need  One community may need job creation  another may need worker housing  another may need for sale housing  some may need for rent housing and of course retail Q  What are the fundamentals supporting urban investment  K  Robert  Bobby  Turner  The US population is going to grow by over 120 million in the next 30 years  The vast majority  perhaps more than 90   will be minority groups who will move to what are called gateway cities where there already exists a density and diversity of those populations Q  What do you see as the key macro problems in urban markets  K  Robert  Bobby  Turner  As a society  we are in real trouble  particularly in America  We are a society of consumers not investors  In my generation  the baby boomers  we have believed that success is defined by materialism  As Americans  we spend more than 51  of our disposable income on housing and transportation  That is ludicrous when compared against the vast majority of the world who spend significantly less  France spends just 32  on income and housing  Japan 27   United Kingdom 21   India 14  and China 10   Americans love big homes  The average home in America is 2 300 sq  ft  Compare that with France and Japan where the average is 1 200sq ft  the United Kingdom where it s around 818 sq  ft  India where it s 504 sq  ft and India at 350 sq  ft  Our homes are almost 9 times the size of a typical Chinese home   Also  only 4 5  of the US population uses public transportation  That s unbelievable  The US household carbon footprint is more than 5 times the global average  We are consuming Think of the impact on the economy when we spend all that money on consumption rather than where we could be spending  healthcare  education and so on  It translates very easily  Today  America ranks 5th in the world on per capita education spending  We test nearly 35th in the world in relation to STEM  Science  Technology  Engineering and Mathematics   Why is that  If we look at how and where we spend money as a society  We as Americans rely on K 12 education to be paid entirely by the government  We don t subsidize or supplement it  The average American family spends less than 1  of their disposable income on education  The country that ranks 1st in the world for STEM is South Korea  This is a country that also relies on their government to pay for K 12 education  Notwithstanding  the average Korean family spends over 10  of their disposable income to supplement education in the form of tutors  after school programs  summer programs and so on If you ask an American where the DJIA or Facebook is trading today  everybody knows  Ask the same person how many kids dropped out of high school last year and nobody knows  That to me is very short sighted  after all what is the better barometer of the future of America  You now have a number of new generations  Generation X  around 40 million large  kids born between 1965 1980  who are fairly pessimistic  They ve seen the market crash and see that home ownership  401 K s and pension plans  which their parents told them would allow them to retire at 62  simply don t work now  12 million homes are worth less than their debt in the USA  pension funds are down  services and amenities are down and the reality is that Gen X have to adapt to new rules  They are downsizing and de leveraging  Then you have Generation Y  75 million in size born from 1980 to 1995   This group is raised on technology  My kids live on Facebook and their lives are about consensus and community building  It s not about living in an isolated mansion  They see a parent s failure to retire and see that home ownership is no longer interesting  For them  the new American Dream is about the experience of products  and they are very concerned about the environment Q  Do underlying trends in Generation X and Y impact your urban investment strategy  K  Robert  Bobby  Turner  The preferences and sentiments of the next generation of Americans will be driven toward transit oriented urban living  Part of this is emotional and part is economic  If the average household that spends 25  of their budget on transportation moves to a transit rich neighborhood  they could take this spend down to just 9   We re talking 14  of income that could now be spent on something else just by moving to a transit rich neighborhood  We haven t done that yet in America  we haven t invested in the infrastructure  and as a result only 4 5  of the population use public transportation I believe that legislation will also come in  meaning that smart growth and global warming policies will drive demand  We as a society are finally recognising that something must be done  We ve just experienced the warmest 12 months in the history of record keeping of America  there was no winter here this year  If people still believe that global warming is a myth  My goodness we re in a whole heap of trouble Q  Is the investment methodology for urban different from other forms of investment  K  Robert  Bobby  Turner  The skills required to be successful in urban development are very different than those required in non urban development  You are dealing with a very different consumer  You are dealing with minorities  language issues  immigrants  crime  gang membership and so on  In the goal of identifying  quantifying and mitigating risks  which have typically been the realm of government spending and philanthropy   you ve got to recognize the conditional skills and tools you need are different  you have to think out of the box  Grabbing your HP 12 C and doing combinations  simulations and permutations on cash flow models simply won t cut it When we talk about urban  the vast majority of people think   my goodness  these are poor communities  risky communities  communities that are characterized by ethnic communities with low income and high poverty rates  high crime rates  drug issues  gang issues etc etc    The reality is that while many of the communities we invest in may be poor per capita  they are significantly richer when you assess spending and disposable income per square mile  than some non urban marketplaces  I remember back in 1994  I was developing a big box retail project in Harlem  New York  I met the folks from Home Depot and we suggested they developed their first Manhattan based Home Depot in Harlem  The response was that they thought it was safer to build their next store in Greenwich  Connecticut  Why  Because they felt the per capita household income in Greenwich was say  100 000 and in Harlem it was  25 000  We had to educate that retailer about the fact that population density in Harlem was over 10 times that in Connecticut   The average house in Greenwich sits on around 1 acre while in Harlem you have 50 apartments in the same space  In reality you have to multiply the density of population by per capita income to figure out what the true spending power is   and that requires education When Magic and I got together  we defined intelligence in two ways  We started with IQ  your intellectual quotient  how good you are at linear thought processes  and then realized that you also have EQ  your emotional quotient  how good you are at understanding and working with people   You want to focus on marketplaces where you can collaborate with communities and partners to identify  quantify and mitigate risk Our investment methodology is driven around what consumers needs are  If you go into a community to build retail  don t be arrogant enough to assume that you know what retail that community wants  You have to work with community leaders to find out what kind of restaurants  dry goods  soft goods  banking and other items they want  Who are the dominant ethnic grocers in the area to anchor the market with  How are you going to deal with crime and gang membership  In this case  there are great opportunities with public private partnerships that work with local law enforcement agencies  There s also great ways to work with technology  Things as simple as changing the wattage of bulbs in a parking field so that you light it up like a soccer field  That s very disruptive to criminals  CCTV  24 7 local police presences   These are things you have experience of   but which most investors simply do not understand Magic and I brought together a dream team of people to help us run this fund  a member of our team is a recovering law enforcement agent   He goes into a neighborhood with us  sits down with the local police precinct and watch managers and helps us to understand how  as a partnership  we can mitigate risks Q  What risks are you not prepared to take on  K  Robert  Bobby  Turner  Things like zoning and entitlement  those are political risks  I will only take on risks I can control  things like construction risk  financial risk  lease up risk and even the risk that I may not find patrons  What I m not going to do is buy land or a building and hope that I can convince politicians and policy makers to support my ideas for re use or development  We work in partnership and I do not need to invest in marketplaces that are not supportive of urban development Q  What is the role of education in urban development  K  Robert  Bobby  Turner  Our urban fund and our education fund are so co dependent on each other  The biggest social issue facing communities is education  the fact that we re failing to educate the backbone of tomorrow s society  With all of our developments  we aim to complement them with education projects We re no longer competitive in the global economy with regards our GDP when compared to other countries who are actually educating  We ve gone from number 1 to number 35 in education in 20 years  Over that same period  US GDP has grown 150   South Korea has grown over 250   China 1700   India 472   A lot of that is due to education Outside my main job over the last 7 years  I ve built 38 charter schools in Los Angeles using Melinda Gates  money  creating 16 000 school seats  I ve found that by using philanthropy I was only moderately impactful  In LA alone  there are over 38 000 children on the wait list  there s a lot of work yet to be done This is generational  The Chinese  the South Koreans  the vast majority of these emerging nations are doing now what we did in the west hundreds of years ago  They re investing generationally  North America and the EU have lost that  we re consumers and we don t think of anything other than ourselves What does this mean for Investors   Risk Managers Many of the greatest investment opportunities in history have come from major macro trends in society be they industrialization  globalization  conflicts or otherwise  Urbanization is no less profound than any of these  potentially being the single biggest migration in human history Urbanization presents exceptional short  and long term opportunities for investors with the right skills  appetite and  perhaps most important  the right attitude

course  these nascent signs of growth in the housing industry don t translate into 10  home jump prices  as some   But they do lead to increased optimism about the state of our housing market  which

coatings and paints manufacturer and distributor in the world  It has seen tremendous growth recently  as evidenced by a 46  average earnings growth for the past 3 quarters  Moreover  this growth has largely been sustained throughout recent years  Valspar has a 3 Year EPS Growth Rate of 24  and has reported 3 consecutive years of annual earnings growth  Valspar also has  raised its shareholder dividend for 34 consecutive years  Although Valspar recently lowered estimates for this year s earnings growth  it is in a strong position to benefit from an improving domestic housing market  about half of Valspar s revenue is generated in the U S  Investors agree  as evidenced by the 36 9  YTD gain in its stock price Valspar s strong earnings is due to several reasons  For one  it has been on top of innovation in the coatings and paints industries  which are hardly known for technological advances  Recently  Valspar introduced a new paint color application  known as ConnectLIVE  that will will enable customers to pick the right color for their home  This app  available for free download on the iPad  utilizes video technology to create a virtual appointment between a Valspar color consultant and customers  the color consultant recommends a customized color scheme for each person s space and style  Valspar s innovative mindset and its ability to leverage new technology for its own benefit will continue to positively impact the company in its future Valspar is also significantly benefiting from its international presence  Although it was recently negatively impacted by a soft housing market in Australia  Valspar has had huge success in China  Much of its growth is coming from a wider array of products aimed at the Chinese affordable housing market  which is being supported by the Chinese government  Valspar s products have been positively received in China  which remains a relatively untapped market for major coatings and paints companies  Despite these significant advantages  Valspar is not content to rest on its laurels  Instead  it has continued to aggressively expand while also undergoing restructuring to improve the company  In 2010  it announced the acquisition of Australian paint manufacturer Wattyl Limited  which has played an integral part in establishing Valspar s presence in the Asia Pacific region  Valspar has also recently initiated a restructuring plan in which it is dumping high volume but unprofitable product lines in order to create a slimmer  more profitable company  This has allowed Valspar to post a gross margin of 34 6  for the second quarter of 2012  up 230 basis points from 2011  Also  Valspar s paint segment EBIT margin increased to 12 5  in the second quarter of 2012  up 200 basis points YOY  With this combination of restructuring and aggressive expansion  Valspar is poised to benefit in the long term Overall  Valspar is an excellent company with sound financials that has several significant catalysts going in its favor  If the U S  housing market continues to improve  Valspar will be an attractive stock that investors should definitely consider adding to their portfolios

Valspar introduced a new paint color application  known as ConnectLIVE  that will will enable customers to pick the right color for their home  This app  available for free download on the iPad  utilizes video technology to create a virtual appointment between a Valspar color consultant and customers  the color consultant recommends a customized color scheme for each person s space and style  Valspar s innovative mindset and its ability to leverage new technology for its own benefit will continue to positively impact the company in its future Valspar is also significantly benefiting from its international presence  Although it was recently negatively impacted by a soft housing market in Australia  Valspar has had huge success in China  Much of its growth is coming from a wider array of products aimed at the Chinese affordable housing market  which is being supported by the Chinese government  Valspar s products have been positively received in China  which remains a relatively untapped market for major coatings and paints companies  ExpansionDespite these significant advantages  Valspar is not content to rest on its laurels  Instead  it has continued to aggressively expand while also undergoing restructuring to improve the company  In 2010  it announced the acquisition of Australian paint manufacturer Wattyl Limited  which has played an integral part in establishing Valspar s presence in the Asia Pacific region  Valspar has also recently initiated a restructuring plan in which it is dumping high volume but unprofitable product lines in order to create a slimmer  more profitable company  This has allowed Valspar to post a gross margin of 34 6  for the second quarter of 2012  up 230 basis points from 2011  Also  Valspar s paint segment EBIT margin increased to 12 5  in the second quarter of 2012  up 200 basis points YOY  With this combination of restructuring and aggressive expansion  Valspar is poised to benefit in the long term Overall  Valspar is an excellent company with sound financials that has several significant catalysts going in its favor  If the U S  housing market continues to improve  Valspar will be an attractive stock that investors should definitely consider adding to their portfolios ,2012-07-10,George Liu,https://www.investing.com/analysis/housing:-valspar's-a-good-gauge-129155,129155

164728,386244,HD,Another Misbehaved CEO At Best Buy ,opinion,I m not sure what s up with some of these big corporate CEOs keep making the news headline for having  inappropriate relationship  with a female employee  The latest episode of high profile executive resignation  read  fired  came from Best Buy  BBY   the electronic retail giant  Best Buy  in the morning of Tuesday  April 10 that CEO Brian Dunn s resignation was the result of a  mutual agreement that it was time for new leadership to address the challenges that face the company    The real story behind Dunns  abrupt departure was only revealed two days later by Best Buy s hometown newspaper  the   Best Buy s board of directors is investigating allegations that Dunn s misused company resources in the course of an inappropriate relationship with a female employee  If this sounds familiar  it is because Mark Hurd  the former CEO of Hewlett Packard  HPQ   was ousted under somewhat similar circumstances just last August   Mark Hurd was dubbed as one of the best CEOs in the country that had turned HP around into one of the world s biggest technology companies  However  Hurd s drastic cost cutting measures  including 15 200 job cuts  also had alienated many employees as well as board members  which is likely one of the contributing factors to his eventual dismissal   Brian Dunn  on the other hand  is supposedly well liked within the company  Never graduated from college  he has worked his way up from the sales floor to the C Suite during his 28 years with Best Buy  However  the company stocks have declined almost 43  since Dunn took over as the Director and CEO in June of 2009  and has been struggling with losing sales to online rivals like Amazon and NewEgg  Dunn and Best Buy s board have been criticized for not doing enough to cut costs  and increase its online presence  Not even Dunn s plan to close 50 of its 1 100 large U S  stores and to expand its smaller Best Buy Mobile has managed to inspire investors  So it looks like Dunn s days of CEO were already numbered  and this incident was just the last straw for the company board to move up the CEO replacement timeline   Some believe Best Buy s outdated big box store model is the culprit of the company s inability to compete with online retailers like Amazon  However  big box stores do serve a different target audience from online shopping sites  Big stores like Walmart  WMT  may still compete effectively with the likes of Amazon with proper store location  space utilization  good supply chain management and customer service  Ultimately  as noted in our previous analysis  Best Buy fails miserably compared even to big box peers including Home Depot  HD   and the main problem has to do with its poor corporate and store management  terrible customer service and lack of a focused leadership and strategy The difference between HP and Best Buy is that Hurd was a successful CEO leaving HP at a much stronger position to deal with an executive turnover than Dunn had with Best Buy   But even so  HP stocks have not regained the lost ground after Hurd s exit eight months ago  see chart above    Right now  Wall Street analysts are focusing on the search for Dunn s replacement  Needless to say  it will be a monumental uphill battle to even halt the current downward spiral of Best buy no matter who takes the helm ,2012-04-14,EconMatters,https://www.investing.com/analysis/another-misbehaved-ceo-at-best-buy-120092,120092

164732,386248,HD,The Trade  Home Builder Stocks  Mortgage Rates  Key Levels,opinion,This week  we will examine three different companies of whom are benefiting from a low interest rate environment  Many leading stocks in the home builder and home improvement sectors have soared in 2012 as the 10 year bond yield has declined below 2 00 percent  Last week  the 30 year mortgage rate fell to 3 79 percent which is an all time low  Unlike in 2005  home prices are currently at depressed levels  falling 35 percent from the 2006 peak  Therefore  the ability to obtain a mortgage rate under 4 00 makes housing and property attractive to many investors  Lets take a close look at the stocks that seem to be soaring due to these current interest rate conditions Mohawk Industries  Inc   NYSE MHK  is one of the world s leading producers of floor covering products for residential and commercial properties  Some of the products that the company makes include carpets  ceramic tiles  laminates  rugs  carpet pads  hardwood  and resilients  Last week  MKH stock finished at a new three year high closing at  73 52 a share  It is important to note that the stock has surged higher by more than  30 00 since October 4  2012  The stock looks strong on the charts  trading above all of the important 50  and 200 moving averages  The only problem with the stock is that it is now very overbought and extended on the daily and weekly charts This formation tells us that the stock may now need to pullback and consolidate before moving higher  The near term resistance area for MHK will be around the  75 50 level  Should the stock pullback from its current price there should be short term support around the  69 00 and  65 50  and  62 00 levels  Take careful note of these levels  place them on your charts and trade them accordingly Masco Corporation  NYSE MAS  is another stock in the home improvements and building products business that made a new 52 week high  On October 4  2012 the stock traded as low as  6 60 a share  last week MAS closed at  14 40 a share  This stock is also short term overbought on the daily chart  The near term resistance levels for MAS stock will be around the  15 75 and  18 00 levels  The stock could be due to a pullback or consolidate before moving higher  Should the stock pullback in the near term there should be support around the  12 80  and 11 65 levels  The Home Depot  NYSE HD  is just another of the many stocks in the home repair sector that made a new high last week  This time around  the stock made a new 9 year high closing at  51 96 on May 4  2012  HD stock remains in a strong uptrend at this time  The only problem is that it could be due to pull back if the stock market pulls back  In other words  it could become a victim of  the overall stock market which is looking a little weak at the moment  HD stock will have daily chart resistance around the  53 25  and  58 00 levels  Should the stock pullback traders can watch for near term support around the  49 00  and  46 00 levels ,2012-05-08,Nicholas Santiago,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-trade:-home-builder-stocks,-mortgage-rates,-key-levels-122441",122441
164733,386249,HD,Predictable Suspects  5 ETF Short Squeeze Candidates  EWZ  EWP  UNG ,opinion,A stock or ETF s short interest and short ratio can be instructive on multiple fronts  Obviously  this data can lead a trader to valid bearish plays using the theory that the more folks that are paying attention to rising short interest  the more followers there are that apt to join the party  even if they re late    Or short interest data can be helpful in terms of making contrarian bets  After all  the shorts will eventually cover  whether they are doing so willingly or unwillingly  The bigger an ETF s short interest  the more viable the fund is as a short squeeze candidate  Plus  it must not be forgotten that the longer the days to cover  the more amplified the short squeeze effect could be    With that in mind  we went hunting for highly liquid ETFs  at least 250 000 shares in average daily volume  that have the look of potential short squeeze candidates  The list turned up some not so surprising candidates    iShares MSCI Spain Index Fund  NYSE  EWP  It s fair to say the results of the Greek and French elections over the weekend were priced into European and U S  equities because EWP is trading higher by almost 3  today on volume that is already more than double the daily average    We ve been bashing EWP and a yield that was in the double digits heading into today for a while and with good reason  Finviz data indicated almost 65  of EWP s 5 8 million shares outstanding have been sold short  In other words  it can be said that Monday s bullish action in EWP is largely the product of short covering  not traders and investors establishing new long positions in EWP    iShares MSCI Italy Index Fund  NYSE  EWI  See above  EWI  another eurozone ETF abomination yield trap that we ve not had kind words for recently  is higher by 3  as of this writing  As is the case with EWP  the worst of the eurozone political news may have already been baked into EWI  Short covering  Probably  Nearly 34  of EWI s 6 6 million shares outstanding are sold short    United States Natural Gas Fund  NYSE  UNG  UNG is a good news bad news story and has been for all of its five plus years of existence  The good new is UNG does exactly what it s supposed to do and that is efficiently track natural gas futures  The bad news  until recently  natural gas futures had been in a seemingly never ending tailspin for almost four years    Making a bullish call on natural gas is a bold thing to do at the moment  but UNG has shown some signs of life recently and the short squeeze potential with this ETF is nothing short of alluring  More than 57  of UNG s 435 4 million shares outstanding are sold short  Any bullishness for natural gas futures and or news of lower production could boost UNG  forcing a wave of short covering    Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR  NYSE  XLY  The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR is an interesting case because only in the past week have the shorts really started to see results  XLY is up more than 15  year to date  but has lost 2 1  in the week    Should real estate and employment data weaken  XLY s top 10 holdings such as Amazon  Nasdaq  AMZN   Home Depot  NYSE  HD   Ford  NYSE  F  and Nike  NYSE  NKE  could be crimped  If that happens  XLY could easily violate support around  44 50 and in that case  it would be best to join the shorts or put buyers rather than trying to catch a short squeeze  Translation  XLY probably needs to endure more near term pain before it becomes a credible squeeze candidate    iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund  NYES  EWZ  If we re going to be technical about things  EWZ s short interest of 18 1  of 143 million shares outstanding isn t considered high  Short interests of 20  and above are  high   However  speaking of 20   that s the decline necessary for a security or index to be considered in a bear market  Rounding EWZ s price at this writing up to  59 and it s highest closing price this year down to  70  we see that EWZ has lost almost 17  from its February peak    Given how volatile EWZ  losing 3  in a couple of days  in turn forcing the ETF into bear territory  is not out of the realm of possibility  Should that happen  the short interest here will very likely increase  Down the road  should Brazil ETFs bounce back  the short covering with EWZ would likely be intense  For now  play the downtrend with the ProShares UltraShort Brazil  NYSE  BZQ  and wait for EWZ s short interest to rise some more before taking nibbles from the long side By The ETF Professor,2012-05-08,Benzinga ,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/predictable-suspects:-5-etf-short-squeeze-candidates-(ewz,-ewp,-ung)-122521",122521
164734,386250,HD,3 Small Cap Stocks With Heavy Insider Buying ,opinion,As the market moved steadily higher throughout the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012  insider buying slowed to a crawl and eventually ground to a halt  That s just how insiders operate  They like a bargain just like everyone else  and frankly  by the end of the first quarter  it was getting harder to spot verifiable bargains    Of course  a slumping market is a sure fire magnet to get these insiders to open up their checkbooks  And that s precisely what s going on  Since the start of May  roughly a month after the market began to pull back  insider buying has surged  Right now  it s common to find a half dozen or more daily instances of at least  100 000 in fresh insider buying by a key executive     Yet you shouldn t necessarily follow their lead and take their actions as a buy signal  After all  insiders are notoriously bad market timers  and their buying often comes before even deeper drops ahead  Instead  I use insider buying signals for long term investment ideas  but almost never as a short term trade     I do look to insider buying signals when I m bearish on a stock  Fresh buying  after a stock has fallen substantially  may signal that the opportunity on the short side has already been fulfilled  For example  Netflix s  Nasdaq  NFLX  Jay Hoag  a company director  has bought a hefty  25 million in company stock in recent days at an average price of around  73 a share     I thought Netflix was overvalued in early March when it traded for  113 a share  and I still thought it was overvalued in late April when it had plunged to  86  I still think this company s upcoming challenges have yet to be factored into the stock price  but a move down to  70    along with that inside buying    would make me cover a short position if I had one in place    Here are three other stocks with recent insider buying that are worthy of more research    1  Merge Healthcare  Nasdaq  MRGE  This provider of digitized medical imaging services has fallen by two thirds from its 52 week high  taking a final sharp blow in early May when management announced that sales growth would slow this year  In response  six insiders have recently bought nearly  1 million in stock  on a collective basis   and this move could pay off handsomely because this stock looks quite oversold     Merge is well positioned to handle the ongoing shift in the health care sector away from written medical records to electronic medical records  The company s software works with all of the major health care information technology  IT  providers  systems  and by all indications  sales should again be rising at a sustained double digit pace in 2013 and beyond    2  Geeknet  Nasdaq  GKNT  Straight away  I d caution that this is a thinly traded micro cap  so it comes with its own set of risks  Geeknet recently decided to shed one of its two business lines  which could unlock real value  For a number of years  Geeknet worked to be a major player in the world of tech websites  operating sites such as Slashdot  an IT newsblog  and Freecode  which distributes Linux code and other software   Trouble is  there were never really big profits to be made from these sites  Now  management wants to unload those sites to better focus on a burgeoning e commerce business    This company s eponymously named website  thinkgeek com  carries a wide range of unique tech gadgets  many of which are exclusive to the company and are often hot selling gifts during the holidays  Sales in this business rose 50  in 2010  another 30  in 2011 and could rise another 15  to 20  this year to about  140 million     Insiders  led by Chairman Ken Langone  who co founded Home Depot NYSE  HD    have been steadily buying small clusters of stock since February  picking up more stock late last week after the company announced plans to seek a buyer for the various websites     Beyond the growth metrics noted above  this is also a value play  Net cash of  32 million accounts for more than one third if the stock price  If you back that out  then the price to sales ratio for this e commerce play is less than 0 5  said another way  every dollar of stock you pay for gets you 50 cents in sales     3  Vocus  Nasdaq  VOCS  Vocus helps corporate clients manage their online marketing efforts using search  social media and other tools  In late February  this company made a bold acquisition    and shares got crushed as investors realized the deal would hurt profits now but boost them later  A decision to buy iContact  an e mail marketing firm  for  169 million is expected to help Vocus offer an even wider array of integrated marketing tools     Still  management conceded that the deal would lead to much lower near term profits as expenses build in support of a larger sales force  Full year earnings forecasts fell by half or more  and Vocus is now expected to earn roughly  0 40 a share this year  down from  0 81 in 2010  and about  0 65 in 2013  Though shares have fallen from  34 to  15 during the past year  they may not look like a deep bargain on a price to earnings  P E  basis  but a group of five insiders recently bought more than  1 million in stock  collectively  at an average price of around  16  That surely makes this stock worthy of further research     Risks to Consider  As noted above  insiders are notoriously poor market timers  and these stocks could fall even more if the market stumbles badly  Don t confuse insider stocks with value stocks    Insiders have a much better track record if you have a one to two year time horizon  Their buying often comes at a time when a company is in transition  as is the case with these four stocks noted above  and it often takes several quarters for that transition to play out  Still  they could turn out to be great pickups for your portfolio BY David

nearing a bubble top  This played out in 2005 2006  I ve suggested many times in the past that the biggest issue facing America from an employment perspective is outsourcing  which we will recap here   In October 2007  when oil broke  80 a barrel the first time  we predicted an economic collapse that was unparalleled  The banking crisis hit behind that  We also pegged the bottom in late 2008 early 2009 from the VIX reading  All of these reports are available in the archive We are  currently  in a near Depression that can t be rivaled since the early to mid 1930 s  mostly caused by the lack of regulation in the real estate and mortgage markets of the mid 2000s  but also by a derivative bubble in the stock markets and the controlled price of oil But the problems aren t over  partially because of our own undoing  due to a lack of education We have talked many times in the past about how technology affects employment  The reality is that the US  the greatest economy in the world until the last 5 years  has begun to outsource what I call support employment  Ever bought a Dell  DELL  computer  Ever needed help  Ever talked to someone with a name that sounded foreign  There you have it  Now  this isn t the end of the world  I live in Arizona  a state where house cleaners and landscape maintenance folk have employed what I will generously call  cheap labor  for a long time  But there comes a time where technology and outsourcing make a difference  Been to a grocery store lately  What used to take 8 check out clerks helping you check out and pay is now down to three plus the guy that monitors the self checkout lines  Home Depot  HD  and Lowe s  LOW  offer this now  It s a norm  This is where the world is going We eliminated manufacturing jobs with computers  Now check out clerks  Then sales people  It doesn t end  but it does mean trouble on the labor front  An economy will never support 4  unemployment with most employment dependent on higher end wages  We don t even need to talk about minimum wage  Let s just face the facts  The Internet  technology  and out sourcing have increased unemployment Then the rest of the world tried austerity  What is it  It s tightening the belt  It s taking the idea that we can spend less on things and do better  To be kind  it s BS  It doesn t work  Spending less on things means higher unemployment  which is the whole problem right now What is a Depression  It s when everyone spends less and becomes risk averse  How does it work  Simple  Most people decide to pay off debt instead of invest and spend  That s individuals  That s businesses  That s people in general  That s the government  Historically  what breaks that cycle  The only group in the equation that can spend more  Government  Businesses in this country are sitting on two TRILLION dollars in excess capital  Profits have never been higher  But they don t spend  For the first time in 30 years  individuals are paying off debts  And  tax rates are at historic lows  If low tax rates created jobs  we would have the lowest unemployment in years  But we don t  Why Because low taxes don t mean anything for employment  Businesses produce goods  and they do it when they see buyers  There are no buyers because unemployment is too high  The middle class gets smaller day by day  So how do we fix this  There is only one way that has worked throughout history  The government must spend If we need a reminder of this  look at most of the countries in Europe over the last two years  They tried to cut government spending  and unemployment rose  They tried to balance the budget by spending less  saving more  and not raising costs  It didn t work  It never has before in history  The role of government should be simple  Stay out of the way usually  but when things are good  collect taxes that pay off debts  and when they aren t good  spend  That s reality  Don t spend more in the bad times than you have to  but spend to bridge the gap until the economy is repaired  There has never  not once in history  been an economy that has fixed itself on lower taxes  In fact  countries have died on that principle Europe is now the example  Britain felt a depression coming and cut spending without raising taxes on the elite  and now faces higher unemployment than ever  That means a smaller middle class and no buying power to buy goods from producers The current US Congress was voted in with one job  Pass a Jobs Bill  Not a tax cut  which we ve been trying for ten years without success  but a Jobs Bill that puts people back to work  Until you accept that this country includes people that will forever be middle class  but people that can build and fix and improve infrastructure  well  you haven t understood this country France and Greece and most of Europe tried austerity  It s a bad principle  Balance your books during the good times  We didn t do that in 2000 when we had a surplus  We voted to give the money back  remember the  200 check you got in 2001   and to cut taxes on the  job creators   That was our solution  We don t try to balance the books when spending is weak  At those times  we should spend more  The only reason this is a problem is that most of the world went on a ten year spending binge without trying to balance the books when things were good  Now we have to clean it up The current Congress has failed miserably at their primary job  which is to put the middle class back to work  There has been no bill passed that represents or enables those jobs  The economy is now in trouble because of this failure  The US sat through a debt downgrade not because we were unwilling to understand the issues  but because we couldn t do what has always been done to solve the problem  cut spending where we can and raise taxes to pay the bills  This was the first downgrade of US debt in history  and it wasn t because of deficit spending  It was because the S P and groups that decide when to upgrade and downgrade realized that we were no longer serious about solving our problems There is now only one path out of our own misery  and that is for the government to recognize that there are bridges and roads and rails to be repaired  and that US workers are the best to make those fixes and improvements  We need to invest in our future and our infrastructure as a country as we always have in the past  raise taxes on those that benefit the most  and take strides to balance our budget  We can fix this in the next couple of years  but not if we continue to believe that taxes are a bad word  especially for those that benefit from this great country  Put people back to work and you will have a growing class of citizens who can spend to purchase goods and services  and that will break the cycle of depression  It won t happen without that  no matter what anyone does with taxes Technology improves and eliminates jobs  Tightening the proverbial belt of spending does the same  Combine the two and employment can never improve  It means that less people can trade  less people can invest  markets become dependent on the Fed  and volume and activity decreases  which is bad for traders  We can do better  Let s not get the next Congress wrong ,2012-06-11,Tradesight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/austerity-and-technology:-two-evil-words-for-employment-126064,126064
164765,386281,HD,Individual Stocks and Diversification,opinion,In another article  I wrote about a client who originally had his 401 k  invested 100  in company stock   The gist of that article was to highlight the importance of investing according to your risk tolerance  given that his original investment was very aggressive  while his risk tolerance was conservative But what if his risk tolerance had indeed been very aggressive  as well   Would his original investment have been then suitable for him In a word  no No matter how aggressive an investor you are  investing in one company  or even a few companies  is not a wise move A Few is Fine  if They re Quality  Right Let s say you have your portfolio invested roughly equally in five stocks  all strong companies like Coca Cola  Home Depot  Apple  etc   Return over the long term has been good    You think your portfolio is sound But what if something happens to shake the very foundations of one of those companies   What if poison somehow makes its way into millions of bottles of Coke Zero   Millions of people die from the poison   Coca Cola is plunged into a legal nightmare   Pepsi takes advantage of its foe s troubles by advertising its production process security and quality control measures   Stock price plummets amid reports of Coca Cola s eminent ruination Where is the value of your Coca Cola investment now   What if your kid s college tuition is due and you need to sell Coca Cola stock a month after the first poisonous death    You could be selling at a loss   The tax benefit you gain from the capital loss would be pittance compared to the harm it does your portfolio Ok  this is surely an unlikely scenario  as Coca Cola s own quality control and product testing measures are in place to prevent this from happening   But it s not impossible   And you have 20  of your portfolio riding on Coca Cola s bottling process   Even the simple market price variation of the stock could be problematic if you need to sell at the wrong time Good Diversification Means More than FiveA properly diversified portfolio does not have large concentrations in any one company   A good portfolio includes hundreds of companies  even thousands if you use funds and not individual stocks   In such a portfolio  concentration in any one company could be as low as 1    If that one company goes under  the impact on your overall portfolio would be miniscule So More than Five is All I Need Not exactly   Good diversification also means choosing the right combination   You don t want to own the S P 500  and only the S P 500   You don t want all American companies   You need a mix of different types of asset classes Correlation in the finance industry is a quantitative measure of how closely two investments react compared to each other   A correlation of 1 indicates that the two investments are perfectly correlated   meaning they will react the same way to changing market conditions   The closer the correlation is to 1  the more similarly they will react A correlation of  1 indicates that two investments will react the opposite of each other   The closer to  1  the higher degree of opposite directions   A correlation closer to 0 indicates that the two investments move in ways that are not related to each other In relation to your portfolio  you want to make sure you have investments that are not closely correlated   This involves choosing investments whose correlation approaches 0   Another technique sometimes used is hedging   A hedge is an investment used to offset potential losses that may occur by another investment   This is most often accomplished by using investments involving negative correlation Using the S P 500 example  the S P 500 includes the 500 largest US companies   a good companion investment would be bonds  Or money markets   Or foreign stocks   A hedge against a falling dollar could be investing in foreign bonds in their local currency Of course  diversification does not protect you from systemic risk   As seen in 2008 2009  if the whole market goes down  your portfolio is going to go down with it   Highly volatile markets tend to erase the benefits of correlation   You can t control this kind of risk  like you can investment risk  but that is no reason to forgo diversification Enough is EnoughSo it s not enough to choose just a few stocks   It s not enough to choose a large amount of the same type of investment   A desirable portfolio will focus on global long term healthy asset classes  Within each asset class  a focus on historical volatility  correlation to the S P 500 and potential future return will net the best results  Such a portfolio is much more efficient  in terms of risk and reward  than just a few stocks of all one type ,2011-12-05,Casey Stubbs,https://www.investing.com/analysis/individual-stocks-and-diversification-107613,107613
164766,386282,HD,FX Snapshot  February 21  2012,opinion,Major News this WeekThe Greek saga is looking more and more like a soap opera that is a bit long in the tooth  Last week s news fluctuated  with one day bringing us closer to solving the deadlock between the Eurogroup and the people of Greece  and the next informing us that there had been a setback  The Eurogroup meeting planned for Monday  February 13  when Greece was supposed to receive  130 billion that the ministers of finance of the eurozone had promised if it would agree to their requirements  was postponed to today  The market has lost all sense of where this story line is heading  and the USD CAD responds to each piece of news coming over the news wires  We also received inflation data on Friday that was in line with analysts  expectations  Here are some highlights of the economic news expected this week CanadaCanadian economic news will be sparse this week  The only significant indicator expected is Retail Sales for December  This data will be known Tuesday and analysts expect the figure to be  0 2   which would be down from its last reading at 0 5   Mark Carney  Governor of the Bank of Canada  will deliver a speech in New York this Friday United States The release of economic data will begin on Wednesday with figures on Existing Home Sales in January  Given the most recent U S  data have been encouraging  economists are expecting homes sales to have increased by 400 000 since the last announcement  On Friday  we will know the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index  This important U S  measure is expected at 73  compared to 72 5 last month International The week will be filled with international economic news  On Tuesday  Australia will release its report on the latest meeting of its central bank  It should be recalled that the bank decided to stop reducing rates  leaving them unchanged on the heels of two consecutive reductions  The report will provide an indication of expected future movements  Also on Tuesday  we will know the Consumer Confidence indicator for the eurozone  On Wednesday  the eurozone will release its Manufacturing Purchasing Managers  Index  which is expected to be 50 5  and England will release a report on the latest meeting of its central bank  On Friday morning Germany will release annualized GDP data for the fourth quarter  Analysts believe that the figure will be unchanged  at 1 5   Naturally  we will continue to monitor the Greek soap opera very closely  as in previous weeks  Have a good week The LoonieThe only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable The following graph  which illustrates annualized quarterly changes in economic growth in the U S   demonstrates how volatility in GDP growth has diminished over the years  It appears that a better understanding of economic drivers and the larger reliance on services has dampened swings in economic activity  Unfortunately  this improved economic stability has not reflected itself in financial market activity  As can be seen in the second graph  fluctuations in the currency market seem instead to have grown over the years  This phenomenon can also be seen in the stock markets  whose plunge in 2008 was the worst correction in the last 50 years What is the cause of this situation First  it is becoming increasingly easy  and inexpensive  to buy and sell financial products  This improved liquidity allows investors to react to the smallest changes in economic outlook  Since it is often difficult to determine a  value  for a financial asset  investors tend to trade on the basis of foreseeable changes in its price  its direction   without considering the asset s actual value  This is why we are seeing more and more financial bubbles  In this context  forecasting prices of a financial asset has become even more difficult  In addition  the current economic environment makes forecasting even more complicated  Not only do we need to anticipate changes in the major macro economic variables  GDP  inflation  the trade balance  etc    we also need to forecast the actions  or inaction  of various political leaders  While a financial crisis rages on in most of the West  political leaders must make important  and unpopular  decisions on what comes next  As if this was not already difficult enough  we also need to predict the public s reactions to such decisions In this environment  the surest prediction is that we will continue to see considerable volatility in the prices of financial assets  As seen in 2008  the sheer amplitude of these movements may catch us off guard  while events considered improbable based on the statistical record are occurring with increasing regularity  It has therefore become even more important to seek protection from the moods swings of the financial markets  Have a great week Technical Analysis USD CAD  The expected rebound occurred  but failed to go above 1 0051  only reaching the start of the 1 0052 1 0072 range  In short  nothing much has happened to the USD CAD  which has remained in the 0 9920 1 0072 range since January   The following graph provides daily data  Complete indecision  which can be summarized as follow  an inability to move above the 100 day moving average  the green line   an inability to return to the medium term bearish channel  in pink   and closing right on its 20 day moving average  the red line   the crossing of which in mid  January  the red line  spurred a 450 point surge  The EUR USD remains in a long term bearish channel  in blue  Volatility  We know that many FX pairs are experiencing extremely low volatility  and this represents a great opportunity to buy options at very reasonable prices  to cover rising or dropping levels  depending on whether you are a buyer or seller  Contact your dealer for more information Fixed IncomeCanadian swap and government yields ended the week unchanged for most maturities  as domestic inflation numbers temper the effects of weaker US economic data  and the overall nervousness caused by European markets Yields dropped last Tuesday  as weaker than expected U S  retail sales data and a series of downgrades in Europe by credit rating agency Moody s fuelled demand for Canadian government bonds Market sentiment shifted on Thursday on encouraging news for the US housing and labor markets and signs of progress on the Greek debt crisis The move continued Friday morning after the release of higher inflation numbers in Canada  The total inflation rate climbed 2 5   outpacing the 2 3  anticipated by most economists  Although the number was still in line with the central bank s forecasts  traders reduced their bets for a rate cut in the second half of 2012 This week  we will watch a series of corporate earnings releases from blue chip companies  Walmart  Home Depot  Kraft  Dell     and a few key economic indicators  Tuesday will see the release of Canadian retail sales  the German GDP is scheduled for Thursday  while US housing market statistics are expected on Friday morning  Enjoy your week CommoditiesIn response to the oil embargo set by the European Union  EU   Iran will increase its deliveries of crude oil to China  It now seems clear that the Chinese government will not adhere to the sanctions imposed by the U S  The tug of war between the West and Iran is far from over  and the countries of Europe  already hard hit by the financial crisis  will be the next victims of this confrontation  The price of a barrel of light sweet crude  WTI  for delivery in March surged during the week  closing 5  higher  The price of heating oil  the main index used to hedge the price of diesel  was stable for the week  following a very strong increase earlier in the month  Setting aside the fears raised by the situation in Iran  the possibility of an agreement on the Greek sovereign debt problem is good news for markets  which expect conditions in Europe to stabilize  Combined with better data announced in the U S   this good news could also support the price of oil over the coming months Last Week at a GlanceCanada   In January  the year on year inflation rate sprang to 2 5   On a month over month basis  the CPI rose 0 5  in seasonally adjusted terms  The movement was driven mostly by the transportation component   1 3    Six of the eight broad CPI categories saw monthly advances  Health personal care and recreation education were flat on a seasonally adjusted basis  The Bank of Canada core CPI  which shocked with its softness in December  bounced back 0 2   0 3  seasonally adjusted   This nudged the year on year rate two ticks higher to 2 1   Still  over the past three months  core inflation has remained subdued  progressing only 1 0  annualized  In December  Canadian factory shipments jumped 0 6   well short of the 2  gain expected by consensus  Twelve of the 21 industries rolled forward  The main thrust was provided by transportation equipment   3 7    with autos the main contributor  These increases more than offset decreases in petroleum and coal products and machinery  In volume terms  shipments grew 1 2   Elsewhere  Canadian securities transactions data for December revealed that foreigners added C 7 4 billion in Canadian assets to their portfolios  These included a mix of bonds   C 2 1 billion   money market instruments   C 3 5 billion  and stocks   C 1 7 billion  United States   In January  the consumer price index rose 0 2  over the prior month  Both energy and food prices were up 0 2   The annual inflation rate dropped a tick to 2 9   Excluding food and energy  prices climbed a consensus matching 0 2  on impulse from higher medical care  tobacco and apparel prices  among others  These increases more than offset declines in other segments  including vehicles where prices pursued their downward slant for a fifth month running  The year on year core CPI ticked up to 2 3   On a three month annualized basis  core CPI stood at 2 2   a five month high Still in January  retail sales swelled 0 4   half as much as expected by consensus  The prior month was revised down one tick to flat  The downside surprise to the headline results was due to autos  It should be noted that while unit auto sales were actually very strong in the month  dollar revenues slipped 1 1  on the back of discounts at auto dealerships and of rental car purchases  which are accounted for under business fixed investment  Excluding autos  sales were much stronger  rising 0 7  after sinking a downwardly revised 0 5  in December  The ex autos increase was fuelled by a rebound in gasoline   1 4    sporting goods   1 1   and food beverages   1 3   sales  These more than offset declines elsewhere  including in health personal care   0 3    Discretionary spending  i e   retail sales excluding gasoline  groceries  and health personal care  notched up 0 1  after rising 0 5  the month before  With January s gains  real retail spending has now risen at more than 7  annualized since consumer confidence struck bottom back in August  This is the greatest five month increase in retail sales since December 2010  After expanding at an annualized rate of 8 7  in 2011Q4  real retail spending growth is presently tracking at 1 9  annualized in 2012Q1  which is consistent with moderating yet still healthy GDP growth on the quarter  Again in January  U S  industrial production held level instead of climbing 0 7  as per consensus expectations  However  the prior month was revised up six ticks to  1 0   Capacity utilization fell one tick to 78 5   from an upwardly revised 78 6    Manufacturing production expanded 0 7  after swelling an upwardly revised 1 5  in December  thanks primarily to auto production  which ramped up 6 8   Mining output sank 1 8  after posting robust gains in the prior three months  After showing unexpected weakness in December  utilities contracted sharply once again   2 5    probably due to unseasonably warmer winter temperatures  In February  the Philadelphia Fed index of manufacturing activity rose to a four month high of 10 2  The new orders component reached 11 7  its highest point since last April  The shipments index soared to 15  also a high mark since April  The New York Fed s Empire Index of manufacturing activity flew to 19 53 in the month  its highest level since June 2010  The two activity indices point to increased factory activity in February consistent with Q1 GDP growth of about 2  annualized  Back in January  U S  housing starts bounced back sharply to 699K  topping consensus expectations for 675K units  Single starts fell after three straight months of solid growth  while multi unit starts rebounded slightly after a disappointing December  Building permits rose to 676K  from a downwardly revised 671K   roughly in line with consensus expectations  Single and multi unit permits were up 0 9  and 0 4   respectively  Hence  the January drop in single starts is not likely the start of a downtrend Euro area   The eurozone economy shrank less than expected in Q4  According to the Eurostat flash estimate  GDP fell 0 3   non annualized  after gaining 0 3  the previous quarter  France saw its economy grow 0 2   providing some offset to the weakness in other member countries  including Germany   0 2    Italy   0 7   and the Netherlands   0 7    Of the countries that have reported GDP estimates  Portugal recorded the weakest economic activity   1 3    In comparison  the economy of the United States grew 0 7  in Q42011  while those of Japan and the United Kingdom contracted 0 6  and 0 2   respectively ,2012-02-21,The National Bank of

164767,386283,HD,Sentiment Improves as Second Bailout Loan is Disbursed in Greece  21 Feb 2012,opinion,The Euro is trading on a firm footing on Tuesday after the meeting between European finance ministers came to an agreement do disburse the second bailout loan for Greece   Part of the specifics included losses of 53 5 percent for private investors holding Greek bonds   In addition to this  markets are expecting the release of positive macro data today out of the Eurozone  with consumer confidence figures scheduled for release and improvements showing in the consensus estimates In Australia  the RBA released the minutes from its last monetary policy meeting  which showed that the decision to leave interest rates on hold was a reached with a unanimous vote   This decision was a surprise to most of the market  so the fact that the central bank was in total agreement is leading many analysts to revise their interest rate forecasts for the rest of this year   This type of news  of course  is bullish for the regional currency and bearish for regional equity markets  and we did see rallies in the Australian Dollar after the report was made available In the UK  macro data is mostly second tier but we will see earnings reports from Dragon Oil  AMEC  Segro  and Croda International during the London session   In Asia  stock markets were seen lower  even with the positive news of the Greek resolution in Europe    In Japan  Mazda was one of the bigger laggards  as stories surfaced that the company is in need of raising additional investment capital  to the tune of 100 billion JPY    Ryosan energy was also lower after downward revisions were made to its year end profit forecasts   These stories helped send the Nikkei 225 lower  where it now trades at 9 465 In the US  stock are trading mostly unchanged  with the S P 500 futures showing a gain of 8 2 points   Macro data in the region is scarce here as well  with only the Chicago PMI figures being released   This number has the potential to create some short term volatility but the general trading tone today is more likely to be driven by headline sentiment and the optimism created by the Greek loan story   Key earnings  however  will be seen from Wal Mart  Home Depot  Kraft  and Chesapeake Energy   Yesterday  markets were closed for holiday in the US  so expect some trading hangover to be a guiding factor as investors return back to their trading   title  EUR USD  width  761  height  393    The EUR USD is trading firmer on the hourly charts but prices are starting to roll over after testing key resistance in the 1 3290 region   This area marks critical historical levels as well as the 38 2  retracement of the decline from last November  so we are taking a contrarian bearish view unless we see a daily close above here   Bear targets include 1 2960 initially and a break here will accelerate losses The FTSE 100 continues to pressure significant long term resistance in the 5930 area but prices are having a difficult time pushing higher and momentum indicators are beginning to show reversal signals   Risk to reward clearly favors short positions in the longer term  with current levels seen as acceptable short entries   First bear target comes in at 5800  which is a range low in addition to being a psychological level ,2012-02-22,Spread Betting,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sentiment-improves-as-second-bailout-loan-is-disbursed-in-greece:-21-feb-2012-114662,114662

amount in 2011  But this  think tank   ESRI  had forecast 2011 growth of 2 2  initially  which begs the question  why is it a  leading think tank  as described by the Wall Street Journal  What were they thinking  Separately  President Obama s corporate tax plan could hurt business in Ireland in particular because he seeks a minimum tax on profits made by U S  firms overseas and Ireland s legal

in the Philippines  Last weekend  the Wynn board moved to buy out Okada s 20  stake in Wynn Resorts for  1 9 billion   a 30  discount to its market value  Okada is trying to block the move The battle between Apple and Proview Technology moved to Shanghai  with Chinese tech firm Proview arguing Apple infringed on its trademark on the mainland  Previous court rulings in favor of Proview covered specific retailers in smaller cities  so a Shanghai order would eat into one of Apple s biggest markets  Apple s lawyer argued   Proview has no product  no markets  no customers and no suppliers  It has nothing   Apple sold 1 3 million iPads in China in the third quarter  A ruling is expected soon Meanwhile  leading Apple contract manufacturer  Taiwan s Foxconn Technology Group  said it was hiking wages by up to 25  in its second major salary hike in less than two years as Foxconn comes under further scrutiny for work conditions at its massive plants in China  Workers there currently

lost more than  3 billion   2 4 billion in the fourth quarter   with sales continuing to slide But Sears shares soared 34  over three days  beginning Wednesday  as Lampert took pains to assure analysts that he was not taking the company into bankruptcy and that suppliers had no reason to worry as the company has ample liquidity  In turn  Sears will sell down its vast real estate holdings  spinning off 1 200 smaller stores in a rights offering that s expected to raise  500 million  while 11 department stores will be sold to a mall developer for  270 million The thing is  you re still

called for the nation s wealthiest to pay more taxes  to which New Jersey Republican Gov  Chris Christie replied this week that Buffett should  just write a check and shut up  In an interview with CNN s Piers Morgan  Christie said   I m tired of hearing about it  If he wants to give the government more money  he s got the ability to write a check  Go ahead and write it  Later  in a town hall meeting  Christie said  Democrats  want you to be angry because your neighbor makes more than you do  That s not the New Jersey I know  and it s not the America that I know  Related to the preceding  an AP GfK survey found that 65  of the people favor Obama s plan to require people making  1 million or more pay taxes equal to at least 30  of their income  Just 26  opposed Obama s idea  2 3s of independents support the idea  An AP GfK poll found that 72  of Americans support raising taxes on people with incomes over  1 million a year  But  by a 56 31 margin  more embraced cuts in government

164771,386287,HD,These Companies Are Buying Back a Total of  75 BILLION in Stock,opinion,Wall Street strategists try way too hard to deliver a precise forecast of where the market is headed  They look at price to earnings  P E  ratios  projected sales and profit growth rates  dividend yields and other measures to come up with a target price for stocks  They re wasting their time  The actual price of a stock is determined far more simply  You only need to focus on the supply and demand for stocks For example  the investment firm Liquidity Trim Tabs looks at how much money investors have poured into mutual funds on a daily basis  On days when funds come into the market  the market typically goes up  The reverse is also true Yet as we ve seen the last few years  most investors have been pulling money out of equity funds  parking their money in places like bond funds  Analysts at JP Morgan note that individual investors have pulled  370 billion out of equity funds since 2007  That should have led to a stock market pullback during the past two to three years  but the opposite has been true  The market has tacked on major gains in the current multi year rally How do you explain the anomaly  You have to look at the supply side of the equation as well  Thanks to a wide range of stock buybacks  partially offset by new stock issuance from IPOs and secondary offerings   the supply of stock available for sale is now back down to 2006 levels  according to an analysis done by Bloomberg JP Morgan suggests companies have bought back three times the amount of stock that individual investors have sold  implying that supply is shrinking much faster than demand The trend continues in 2012 Even as the IPO market starts to heat up in 2012  creating a greater supply of shares on the market  the volume of stock buyback activity appears to be far higher  Young companies are issuing a few hundred million dollars in stock  but many blue chips are buying back billions of dollars in shares  This table below looks at the biggest buyback announcements of just the first 10 weeks of 2012 You re looking at roughly  75 billion in stock being taken out of the market by these 24 companies alone  which ignores current major buyback programs that were already in place before the year began   Some of this robust buyback activity can be attributed to interest rates hovering at generational lows  A number of companies such as Hasbro  NYSE  HAS   for example  have taken out loans simply to buy back stock  Timing and buyback size are everything Of course  many of these companies may be making a huge mistake if their shares are already near multi year highs and their P E ratios aren t especially cheap  Case in point  Companies in the S P 500 earmarked roughly 35  of their 2007 cash flow to buybacks  only to find their stocks plunge to much lower levels in 2008  after the buybacks had been completed  Had they waited until the market tanked  they would have shrunk their share counts much more aggressively  Some companies may eventually regret parting with so much cash  Cable operators like Comcast  Nasdaq  CMCSA  and Time Warner Cable  NYSE  TWC  are buying back huge chunks of stock  even though  over their industry  You shouldn t necessarily see these buyback programs as an inducement to buy  either  Tech stocks like Qualcomm  Nasdaq  QCOM  and Motorola Solutions  NYSE  MSI  are buying back stock because they have too much cash  not because they are bargains  Each trades for more than 15 times projected earnings  I like to focus on stocks that have a chance to reduce their share count by 10  or more  such as Applied Materials  Nasdaq  AMAT   Target  NYSE  TGT  and Marathon Petroleum  NYSE  MPC   Each stock trades below the broader market multiple of around 15 to 16  What it means for the market Regardless of what buybacks mean for a particular stock  it s an unequivocal positive for the market  With fewer shares in play  earnings per share could spike to record levels when the economy rebounds  Let s use Home Depot  NYSE  HD  as an example  The do it yourself home improvement retailer had 2 3 billion shares outstanding in 2004  but after years of buybacks  that figure has shrunk to 1 56 billion  Back in 2004  Home Depot earned  1 89 a share  With today s lower share count  that EPS figure would have been  2 82  Coincidentally  that s about what Home Depot is expected to earn this year because net income is far lower than it was back in 2004  But what happens when the housing market improves and profits rise back to 2004 levels  Home Depot would earn closer to  5 a share    a company record  by far  Home Depot could have been more effective at buying back stock only when shares were in a funk  but the company will still reap the benefits of 700 million cut in the share count  And as long as the supply of stock remains restrained  the seeds are sown for further market gains down the road  J P Morgan thinks of buybacks as  bullish fuel as investors will ultimately move back into equities   They favor financial services stocks  which are already inexpensive  compared with the rest of the market  and thus could have a more dramatic impact on their share count if more shares are bought back  Risks to Consider  These big buybacks would prove foolhardy if they are completed just before the next market downturn  Investor Action   Boosting earnings is one thing  but lowering the denominator  number of shares  in calculating that all important EPS figure is also a solid move  And when the numerator  earnings  rises higher  EPS can really shine  Be sure to sort through the stocks in your portfolio to see how any buyback plans will affect the stock  And don t forget to consider this when making any new purchases ,2012-03-20,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-companies-are-buying-back-a-total-of-$75-billion-in-stock-117550,117550

164803,386319,HD,Global Macro Data to Guide Sentiment Today,opinion,Markets have put the breaks on the last week s risk rally as traders square positions ahead of a wide range of macroeconomic event risks scheduled for today   Contributing to this lack of optimism is the continued volatility seen in Italian treasury bonds  which is also starting to be seen in Spain as well   These increases in borrowing costs are leading analysts to revise growth forecasts lower as investors are now requiring higher premiums before investments are made in European sovereign debt   The US Dollar was the main beneficiary overnight as high yielding currencies sold off along side equity markets In the UK  FTSE 100 futures are pointing to a lower open ahead of today s CPI  RPI and Home Prices data   This will guide trading in the London session along with earnings releases from Burberry Group  Talk talk Telecom  and Oxford Instruments   Equity markets in Asia  Europe and the US are all following this trend and trading in the negative so it appears as though we will need to see some positives in today s economic releases in order for this to change course During the New York session  we will see the PPI  Advance Retail Sales  and the Empire State Manufacturing Index alongside some significant earnings reports   Corporate earnings today will come from Home Depot  WalMart  Staples  Autodesk and Agilent Technologies   In Europe  data will be seen with the Eurozone GDP and ZEW reports  along with the EU Trade Balance data   There are no major earnings releases but these would be unlikely to attract much attention anyway  as markets continue to be focused on the negative effects caused by the sovereign debt story  and the macro data gives a better indication of this In Australia  the RBA released the minutes from its last policy meeting and these got some attention as well  in that some members argued that a decrease in interest rates was unnecessary   The dovish members won out  however  and from the minutes we can see that the prevailing decision was based on the uncertain global outlook and the recent declines in inflationary price pressures   The minutes will likely lead some analysts to revise their interest rate forecasts as further rate cuts in 2012 start to look more questionable   AUD USD Pressures Support Above 1 01The AUD USD is starting to look more and more like a head and shoulders pattern on the 4H charts  with the neckline coming in at 1 0125   The level has already been tested and has held so far  but the bounce has been limited and the negative momentum indicator suggests that we will see another test in the coming sessions   A break would be very bearish and target the daily 61 8  Fib retracement The FTSE continues to be caught in its daily descending triangle formation  with consistent lower highs being seen since the beginning of the month   Momentum is in neutral territory  so it is difficult to anticipate the direction of the next break   Better to wait on the sidelines until we see a daily close below 5330   5560 can also be used as an acceptable short term sell area ,2011-11-15,Spread Betting,https://www.investing.com/analysis/global-macro-data-to-guide-sentiment-today-105640,105640

but note an appearance by billionaire Mark Cuban on CNBC  wherein he totally trashed investing in the stock market  saying it was for  hackers    hedge fund types looking for nothing more than an edge  and that cash is  king   Can t say I disagree with Mr  Cuban   U S  Treasury Yields6 mo  0 04  2 yr  0 28  10 yr  2 01  30 yr  2 99 Foreign central banks purchased  38 8 billion in Treasury notes and

 Japan  the second largest holder  also increased its share Total net buying of U S  assets  including equities  totaled  68 6 billion  the highest since November 2010  U S A  U S A    Bankrupt brokerage MF Global s record keeping was so sloppy  there is no telling just where the missing  600 million in customer money is  Myriad federal regulators as well as criminal investigators are on the case and one thing is becoming increasingly clear  the final days were beyond chaotic as MF failed to register all the transactions that took place  forcing regulators to reconstruct the ledger  The bankruptcy trustee alone has a team of 200 accountants attempting to unwind the firm  in addition to 200 MF Global employees who were retained for this purpose  Some customers are finally getting access to a portion of their money the lucky ones as much as 60   Some MF customers are also ticked at JPMorgan Chase as they feel the bank is looking to cut ahead of them in the long line of creditors  JPMorgan argues it s the lead creditor because it had provided MF with a revolving  1 2 billion line of credit before MF imploded    UBS  Switzerland s biggest bank  is looking to reduce headcount by a further 1 500 2 000  after announcing it would eliminate 2 000 back in July   Citigroup is looking to cut 3 000 positions  equal to about 1  of the staff  In both the case of Citi and

staff   From the Financial Times  The Federal Housing Administration touts itself as the only U S  government agency that  costs taxpayers nothing   That may soon change and was hardly true in the first place  Founded in the Depression  the FHA s role in fostering home ownership expanded hugely after the crisis hobbled its private but government sponsored brethren  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  Its share of new mortgages insured expanded six fold to more than 30 percent of the market  But an audit released this week shows that it faces a 50 percent chance of exhausting its current reserves  If home prices fall sharply  auditors reckon it could require as much as  43 billion in support  Some experts say it may be more  The FHA has pitifully small reserves on a portfolio that is now  1 1 trillion   As for Fannie and Freddie  a congressional committee approved a measure that would slash pay for employees of the two mortgage giants  which is leading to an exodus of executives  Freddie CEO Charles E  Haldeman Jr   announced plans to leave next year  The House committee plan still must be approved by the full House  likely  but then move to the Senate  not as likely  Rep  Spencer Bachus  R   Ala   said   Taxpayers own these companies and staff should be paid accordingly   The CEOs at Fannie and Freddie have base salaries of  900 000  but stood to make as much as  6 million a year after receiving deferred pay and bonuses It s an easy argument to make that the executives don t deserve this kind of money  but you still have to be able to attract the right kind of talent or you potentially cost taxpayers further  billions on top of the  150 billion the two have already cost us  However  I m in no way defending  6 million   Enbridge  a Canadian oil pipeline company  is buying a 50  stake in a pipeline that would run south from landlocked Cushing  Oklahoma to the Gulf of Mexico  Thus the oil would then be available for Gulf Coast refineries and change the supply demand situation in the region and lessen the need for imports from Mexico and Venezuela The significance is that heretofore there was excess supply in and around the Cushing delivery point for West Texas Intermediate crude  the price of which I list at the end of the column each week  That has helped keep prices down vs  similar oil types  but now the move by Enbridge is an attempt to drain inventories So the price of West Texas immediately soared over  100 a barrel on the news  but then finished the week around  98   Meanwhile  regarding the controversial Keystone XL pipeline that the Obama administration is looking to delay until after the 2012 election  if it allowed it at all  TransCanada agreed to change the route of the pipeline to avoid the ecologically sensitive Sandhills region of Nebraska  Canada needs the crucial pipelines to export its growing oil sands production from northern Alberta  the third largest reserves in the world  Daily production of 1 5 million barrels from the sands is expected to increase to 3 7 million in 2025   And one other item on the energy front  In August  the latest month for which Energy Department data is available  U S  refiners exported a record average of 895 000 barrels a day of refined fuels  most going to Central and South America  though the Netherlands was the biggest single buyer  mostly diesel fuel But with incentives to produce diesel  that means less production of gasoline by the refiners and that equates to stubbornly high prices for U S  consumers at the pump  in fact currently record prices for this

Emirates for as many as 70 aircraft  California is slated to take in  3 7 billion less in revenues than a budget crafted just a few months ago planned on  necessitating even more cuts to services  including a shorter school year  Tuition at state universities would also rise further  Needless to say  residents of all kinds are outraged   The  constitutionality  of the Obama health care law will be decided by the Supreme Court next spring  March with a likely decision in June  and the nine Justices are going to allow an historic 5   hours to hear oral arguments   Normally it s just one hour for each case presented before them  Editorial   Wall Street Journal The issue at the heart of the ObamaCare challenge brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business is whether the federal government has the constitutional authority  under the Commerce Clause  to order everyone in the United States to purchase health insurance   the so called  individual mandate   If
