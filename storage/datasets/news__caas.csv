3448,224963,CAAS,5 Emerging Market Stocks To Buy After A Rough 2019,opinion,Emerging markets  EMs  were on a rough patch in 2019  with both Argentina and Iran remaining in recession and slowdown visible across Brazil  India  Mexico  Russia  Saudi Arabia and Turkey  The nearly 2 year long trade war between the United States and China also impacted the emerging markets  The series of tariff hikes dampened trade and hit hard the export driven emerging economies Along with that  slowdown in China s economy also spilled over into other developing nations  driving investors away from these markets  Evidently  the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  NYSE EEM  rose 14 6  last year  less than the S P 500 Index s rise of 29 8   However  2020 looks a lot more promising for the emerging markets  here s why  2020 Emerging Market OutlookThere is no assurance that the global economy will rebound this year  but Argentina and Iran are expected to emerge from recession  The World Bank expects a slight decline in growth throughout the United States  Europe and Japan  Collectively  such countries are expected to grow 1 4  this year compared to 1 6  growth in 2019  Much of this is due to the softness in the manufacturing sector and the effect of U S  tariffs and retaliatory measures  However  developing countries are expected to grow at a 4 3  pace in 2020 compared to the 4 1  in 2019 Per a Bloomberg survey of 57 global investors  strategists and traders  emerging markets  assets are expected to outperform their developed peers this year  Moreover  the survey claims that Asia has the best prospects among the rest Theory states that emerging markets perform better during the global business cycle s expansion phase  hence  equities will definitely benefit from the upturn in the global business cycle  Total wealth  stocks and bonds together  of EMs at present exceeds  27 trillion  which is more than the combined wealth of the United States and Germany But  which emerging countries will gain the most Slowdown in the economy along with softness across the manufacturing space had dampened China s growth  However  the iShares MSCI China ETF  MCHI  with holdings from 597 securities grew 22 5  in 2019  thanks to Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and Tencent  which make up nearly 30  of the portfolio  And with the Chinese administration consistently  injecting a lot of liquidity into the system  and easing of the U S  China trade war lowering the tariffs  China seems to have brighter growth prospects this year An underperformer in 2019  South Korea may rebound this year  The U S  China trade war played a massive role in dampening the economy  Moreover  the semiconductor dominant country went into a downturn in 2017 and did not recover in the last two years  However  Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co   Ltd  s   OTC SSNLF   stock has climbed nearly 30  keeping investors hooked to this emerging market Russia was the super performer among the EMs in 2019  the MOEX Russia Index rose 28 5   quite close to the S P 500 index  In fact  the iShares MSCI Russia Capped ETF  ERUS  rose 35 8  last year  surpassing the most successful global indexes like the S P 500 and Nasdaq  The country is expected to continue the momentum in growth and emerge as a fairly valued and popular market Moreover  this year EMs will be a brighter spot for investors as their high growth prospects and rapid pace of industrialization provides higher opportunities of earning significantly higher return  As long as central banks across the globe keep monetary policies relaxed taking inspiration from the Federal Reserve  EM s will perform better  Additionally  the three consecutive rate cuts by Fed lowered the rate of dollar  This in turn helped these EMs that export commodities to perform better as they make the most of the low dollar environment 5 Stocks that Can Make the Most of EM s Growth in 2020As the U S  China trade tiff eases and both countries sit for further resolution  and Fed and other central banks keep rates unchanged and offer liquidity  shares of EM s will surely see a northward movement  In fact  per IMF projections  emerging market and developing economies will experience growth of 4 6  in 2020 compared to the growth in the advanced economies of 1 7  Moreover  emerging markets have attractive valuations and their economies grow at a faster pace  which works perfectly in investors  favor Thus  we have selected five solid stocks from the emerging markets that are poised to grow and flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Sell  or 2  Buy  China Automotive Systems

3453,224968,CAAS,4 Stocks To Watch  FNSR  HTBX  SCMP  VUZI,opinion,"Finisar Corporation  NASDAQ FNSR  gapped sharply after it got up to almost 35  which was my target  and then it backed off to 33 97  It was still up 1 21  or 4   to 33 97  on 2 7 million shares traded on Monday  That s the second biggest volume on an up day since Sept  Now coming out of a flag I think it s significant  but closing at the bottom of the range bothers me  Let s see if there s a follow through  If there is  the target is 37  and eventually 42 
Heat Biolog  NASDAQ HTBX  popped on Monday  It s been up 5 6 days in a row  and particularly in the last 3 days on heavy volume  On Monday  it was up 74 cents  or 30   to 3 23  on 18 5 million shares traded  It was running up near the resistant level and closed above it  The next target is in the 4 85 area  So  if it follows through on Tuesday and runs  we ll just have to see what happens  After hours it did get up to my 3 55 day trade target and pulled back  and then closed strong at 3 44  another 21 cents  so that s 95 cents for the day in a beautiful  intraday rising channel  Again  the target is 4 50  85 
Sucampo Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ SCMP  is interesting  I m never happy when a stock breaks out  pops  flag  doesn t follow through  and pulls back below the breakout point at the low end of the range  That s disconcerting  It was up 30 cents  or 2   to 16 15  on 1 8 million shares traded  But when 1 8 million shares trade  with five   I think they ll be able to short that with a pullback  There is resistance  and my target is 18 1 2  followed by 20 3 4 
Vuzix Corp Cmn Stk  NASDAQ VUZI  was up 25 cents  or 3   to 8 55  on 288 242 shares traded on Monday  and moves up a little bit more each day  It s been up five of the last six days  Ever since the spike down  it has moved up aggressively  back up towards the resistance zone  I would have to say the next target is 9 00  and then 9 50  possibly as much as 9 80  If you see an immediate surge on heavy volume  it might move up slowly  I would not be shocked to see it reach 11 12

3468,224983,CAAS,5 Highest Growth Stocks Since Trump Victory,opinion,"Shrugging off the initial skepticism  the equity market continued its steady ascent since the elections  sending major indices to record highs  Although several critics have doubted the recent bull run as an aftereffect of Donald Trump s victory  experts widely believe that the stock market euphoria is largely attributable to some of the sweeping policy changes proposed by the President elect As we mark the first month of his unexpected win  let s dig a little deep to have a broad overview about the catalysts to the stock market uptrend Investor Friendly PoliciesInfrastructure Thrust  Trump intends to spend  1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years  primarily driven by private financing  In order to lure more capital investment  he aims to offer significant tax breaks to those investors who park a sizable capital in these projects  He envisions that the lost tax revenue would be more than balanced by new income tax revenue from construction workers and business tax revenue from contractors 
As the U S  reportedly needs to spend about 0 7  of its GDP in infrastructure projects till 2030  according to the McKinsey Global Institute  to meet the increasing demands of the economy  a focused roadmap with thrust on the development of key infrastructure facilities is likely to benefit the overall industry Tax Overhaul  In order to augment consumer spending  Trump intends to overhaul the tax structure  This includes the restructuring of the seven individual tax brackets into three and lowering the corporate tax rate to 15  from 35   He expects the lower tax regime to spur higher consumer spending and create about 25 million new jobs over a decade 
The U S  corporate tax rate is reportedly the highest among the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development countries  Consequently  Trump s proposed tax regime is likely to be a boon for those companies that are reeling under a high tax burden Regulatory Rollbacks  The Trump regime is likely to have a series of regulatory rollbacks aimed to boost the profitability of small and medium sized companies  Investors continue to turn to banks as the regulatory burden is likely to ease under Trump presidency  One such change will be the raising of the minimum asset threshold for banking behemoths to  250 billion from  50 billion  This will lend more flexibility  boost valuations  strengthen consolidation and increase lending  Trump has also called for repealing parts of the Dodd Frank Act  which has for a considerable period of time limited operational flexibility Screening ParametersAs the equity markets brace for the Trump era with a relentless surge in major benchmark indices  we have zeroed in on five stocks based on certain screening parameters  These include an average return in excess of 50  in the last 30 days along with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  or better and a Value Growth Momentum score    of  B  or better Our research shows that stocks with a VGM score of  A  or  B   when combined a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  offer the best investment opportunities for investors 5 Top Picks that Trumped MarketAK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS    Ohio based AK Steel is a leading producer of flat rolled carbon  stainless  electrical steel and tubular products  It operates eight steel making and finishing plants  two coke plants and two tube manufacturing plants in Ohio  Pennsylvania  Indiana  Kentucky  Michigan and West Virginia  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a VGM score of  A  and an average return of 56 2  in the last 30 days China Automotive Systems Inc    NASDAQ CAAS    This Zacks Rank  2 stock manufactures and sells automotive systems and components in the People s Republic of China  The stock has a VGM score of  A  and boasts an average return of 89 4  in the last month Hovnanian Enterprises  Inc    NYSE HOV    Headquartered in Red Bank  NJ  Hovnanian is one of the nation s largest homebuilders and develops single family detached homes  attached townhomes and condominiums  urban infill  and active lifestyle homes  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a VGM score of  A  and an average return of 51 6  in the last 30 days KEMET Corp    NYSE KEM    Headquartered in Simpsonville  SC  KEMET is reportedly the world s largest manufacturer of solid tantalum capacitors and one of the world s largest manufacturer of multilayer ceramic capacitors that are used in the automotive  communications  computer related  industrial  consumer  military aerospace  and alternative energy industries  It has a VGM score of  A  and an average return of 66 8  in the last 30 days  KEMET sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  Universal Technical Institute  Inc    NYSE UTI    Universal Technical is a leading provider of post secondary education in the U S  offering degree  diploma and certificate programs in the fields of professional automotive  diesel  collision repair  motorcycle and marine  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a VGM score of  B  and an average return of 57 8  in the last month Moving ForwardJeremy Zirin  chief equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas  perfectly summed up   Things were already improving before the election  What s happened since is that many of the pro growth trends have been exacerbated  and the market is looking at Trump s policies as likely to continue to boost growth   Backed by a favorable Zacks Rank and a health VGM score with a solid 4 week return  these stocks could form an integral part of your portfolio to profit from the growth wave Zacks  Best Investment Ideas for Long Term ProfitToday you can gain access to long term trades with double and triple digit profit potential rarely available to the public  Starting now  you can look inside our stocks under  10  home run and value stock portfolios  plus more  Want a peek at this private information ",2016-12-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-highest-growth-stocks-since-trump-victory-200169269,200169269
3469,224984,CAAS,3 Reasons Value Stock Investors Will Love China Automotive Systems  CAAS ,opinion,"Many investors like to look for value in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for value investors in the near term 
This method discovered several great candidates for value oriented investors  but today let s focus on China Automotive Systems Inc    NASDAQ CAAS   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous reasons why this is the case  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for CAAS s status as a solid value stock below 
Forward PE for China Automotive Systems 
Easily one of the most popular readings for value investors  the forward PE ratio shows us the current price of a stock divided by the full year earnings  Generally speaking  value investors like to see this ratio below 20  though it can vary by industry CHINA AUTO SYS PE Ratio  TTM 

   Right now  CAAS has a forward PE of just 10 15  which means that investors are paying  10 15 for each dollar in expected China Automotive Systems earnings this year  Compared to the industry at large this is pretty favorable as the overall space has an average PE of 13 11 in comparison 
Price to Forward Sales for China Automotive Systems
One of the most underrated ratios for value investors is the price forward sales metric  This ratio shows investors how much they are paying for each dollar of revenues generated  In other words  a lower number is better here while a price to sales ratio of 1 means that you are paying one dollar for each dollar in sales

3493,225008,CAAS,Auto Earnings Releases On May 12  NSANY  CAAS  UFAB  WPRT,opinion,"The Q1 earnings season is nearing the end with about 23  of the S P 500 members left to report results as of May 6  So far  the auto sector has outperformed the remaining 15 Zacks sectors in terms of earnings  As of May 6  it was the only sector to maintain an earnings beat ratio of 100   per our   Moreover  auto sector companies recorded impressive year over year earnings growth of 53 2   Meanwhile  revenues in this sector witnessed a modest 4 4  improvement  with a beat ratio of 40  
Revenues of auto companies are being driven by strong sales in important markets like U S   Europe and China in the first quarter  Meanwhile  the bottom line is benefiting from an increase in the sales of higher margin vehicle segments  such as SUVs and light trucks  due to low fuel prices  However  sluggishness in some emerging markets and expenses related to safety recalls are challenges  The negative impact of foreign currency translation also remains a major headwind 
Among the many stocks lined up to report this week  let s see what awaits these four auto sector companies scheduled to release their results on May 12

3494,225009,CAAS,U S  Auto Sales Fall 6 1  In May  4 Stocks To Avoid Now,opinion,"U S  light vehicle sales fell 6 1  year over year to 1 54 million units in May 2016  This marked the biggest decline in U S  sales since Aug 2010 
While two less selling days compared with May 2015 played a role  the main culprit was a 16  fall in passenger car sales  which offset a 2 4  rise in truck sales  Sales on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate   SAAR   basis dropped to 17 46 million units in May 2016 from 17 47 million units in May 2015 
Although the fundamental factors influencing the auto industry remain strong  the rise in sales volume is expected to be low this year  Given the all time high sales in 2015  even a small increase will set a new record  However  many analysts are of the opinion that auto sales are reaching a peak  which poses a concern 
In fact  automakers have been offering more and more incentives to lure in customers  Per TrueCar  average incentives per vehicle increased 7 1  in May  However  this too failed to pull up sales

3496,225011,CAAS,3 Reasons Why China Automotive Systems  CAAS  Is A Great Value Stock,opinion,Many investors like to look for value in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for value investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for value oriented investors  but today let s focus on China Automotive Systems Inc     NASDAQ CAAS    as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous reasons why this is the case  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for CAAS s status as a solid value stock below Forward PE for China Automotive SystemsEasily one of the most popular readings for value investors  the forward PE ratio shows us the current price of a stock divided by the full year earnings  Generally speaking  value investors like to see this ratio below 20  though it can vary by industry Right now  CAAS has a forward PE of just 5 85  which means that investors are paying  5 85 for each dollar in expected China Automotive Systemsearnings this year  Compared to the industry at large this is pretty favorable as the overall space has an average PE of 11 05 in comparison CHINA AUTO SYS PE Ratio  TTM    Price Cash Flow for China Automotive SystemsAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This reading is preferred by some since it avoids amortization and depreciation concerns and can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business The P CF ratio for CAAS comes in at 5 95  and since investors are generally looking for a reading under 20 here  this is pretty good news  Meanwhile  we should also point out that the industry average for this metric is 7 61  so China Automotive Systemshas its peers beat in this regard too CAAS Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionThe solid value ratios outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  but we should also note that the earnings estimate revisions have been trending in a positive direction as well  Analysts who follow CAAS stock have been raising their estimates for the company lately  meaning that the EPS picture is looking a bit more favorably for China Automotive Systemsnow Over the past 30 days  1 earnings estimate has gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that 1 estimate has moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too   These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as 30 days ago CAAS was expected to post earnings of 64 cents per share for the full year though today it looks to have EPS of 72 cents for the full year Bottom LineFor the reasons detailed above  investors shouldn t be surprised to read that we have CAAS as a stock with a Value Score of  A  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  So if you are a value investor  definitely keep CAAS on your short list as this looks to be a stock that is very well positioned for gains in the near term Zacks  Top Investment Ideas for Long Term ProfitHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today s most promising long term stocks  Starting now  you can look inside our portfolios featuring stocks under  10  income stocks  value investments and more  These picks  which have double and triple digit profit potential  are rarely available to the public  But you can see them now ,2016-11-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-china-automotive-systems-(caas)-is-a-great-value-stock-200165266,200165266
3497,225012,CAAS,Should Value Investors Pick China Automotive  CAAS  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put China Automotive Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CAAS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  China Automotive has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 5  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts China Automotive s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 7 0  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that China Automotive has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 6 3  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  China Automotive has a P S ratio of about 0 3  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  China Automotive currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CAAS a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 5  which is noticeably better than the industry average of 8 7  Clearly  CAAS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though China Automotive might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of C  This gives CAAS a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate jumped 30 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has climbed about 19 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below China Automotive Systems  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineChina Automotive is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a good industry rank  top 15  out of more than 250 industries  and a top Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2017-10-02,Zacks Investment
