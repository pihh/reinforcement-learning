188331,409847,PPL,Why PPL  PPL  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  PPL  PPL   which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This energy and utility holding company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5 74  
For the most recent quarter  PPL was expected to post earnings of  0 49 per share  but it reported  0 52 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 12   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 56 per share  while it actually produced  0 59 per share  a surprise of 5 36  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for PPL lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
PPL has an Earnings ESP of  2 82  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

188351,409867,PPL,Why PPL  PPL  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
PPL in Focus
PPL  PPL  is headquartered in Allentown  and is in the Utilities sector  The stock has seen a price change of  0 65  since the start of the year  The energy and utility holding company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 41 per share  with a dividend yield of 5 33   This compares to the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield of 3 22  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 96  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 64 is up 3 8  from last year  Over the last 5 years  PPL has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 2 30   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  PPL s current payout ratio is 68   meaning it paid out 68  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  PPL expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is  2 34 per share  with earnings expected to increase 4  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  PPL is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2018-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-ppl-ppl-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200352290,200352290

188354,409870,PPL,Earnings Preview  PPL  PPL  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects PPL  PPL  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 14  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy and utility holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 49 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 95 billion  up 1 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PPL 
For PPL  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 03  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PPL will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PPL would post earnings of  0 56 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 59  delivering a surprise of  5 36  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

188387,409903,PPL,Is PPL Corporation  PPL  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put PPL Corporation   NYSE PPL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  PPL Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 9  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts PPL Corporation s current PE ratio tad below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that PPL Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 3  which is roughly in line with the current level  Hence the forward earnings estimates are already incorporated in the company s current share price P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  PPL Corporation has a P S ratio of about 2 9  which is lower than its industry s average of 7 5 right now If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  PPL Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes PPL Corporation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio of PPL Corporation  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 9  which is lower than the industry average of 9  Clearly  PPL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though PPL Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of D  This gives PPL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimate go higher or lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revisions in the same time period The current quarter consensus estimate has increased 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below PPL Corporation Price and Consensus   This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePPL Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 27   it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  its industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia  AIDS  muscular dystrophy  hemophilia  and other

188459,409975,PPL,Are Utilities In A Bubble ,opinion,"Utilities are on a tear  Without accounting for dividends  the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLU  is up 17  so far in 2016 and 28  over the past three years  in both cases outperforming the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY    Stocks that are supposed to be safe income plays have delivered major capital gains 
It s not hard to figure out why this is happening  Interest rates have been at historic lows for several years now  As the Fed continues to push back its timetable for raising rates  bond investors are capitulating and turning to Utilities as a source of yield 
This run up has many people uttering an unusual phrase   Utilities Bubble   Could these traditionally safe stocks be dangerously overvalued and setting up for a crash  And if so  how should investors manage their portfolios to mitigate this risk 
Utilities  Profits Do Not Justify The Stock Performance
Let s quickly dispense with one possible counterargument  that the strong run for Utilities stocks is based on improved financial performance and not yield chasing investors  Figure 1  which shows the trends in average return on invested capital  ROIC  and cumulative after tax operating profit  NOPAT  for the sector over the past few years  clearly shows that profits are flat to down and not driving stock valuations higher 
Figure 1  Utilities ROIC And NOPAT

Nor do macro industry trends support hope for growth in future cash flows  In fact  the exact opposite is true 
Solar panel installations are projected to  in 2016 
The market for energy efficient LED lighting is   part of a larger move towards greater energy efficiency in US households 
With shrinking demand  Utilities will be forced to raise rates on remaining customers  leading to an even higher adoption of solar power and energy saving devices    half of electric utility executives expect these trends to send their industry into a  death spiral  within the next decade 
Underlying cash flows and industry trends do not support the recent outperformance of Utilities stocks 
Current Valuations Imply Unrealistic Profit Growth
Utilities tend to be one of the slowest growing sectors in the economy  Moreover  with the growing threat to the core business model  you d expect to see them trading at a discount to the rest of the market 
Instead  when we measure the profit growth implied by the market s valuation  we see that XLU and SPY have the same exact price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 2 8  Based on their valuations  Utilities are expected to grow at the same rate as the rest of the S P 500  which seems unrealistic 
With inferior profitability  a below par profit growth outlook  and valuations on par with the rest of the market  Utilities pose quite a risk to investors  portfolios 
Figure 2  Ratings Breakdown

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Figure 2 shows that the Utilities sector has a much higher concentration of Dangerous and Very Dangerous rated stocks than the rest of the market  In fact  only one stock in the sector earns our Attractive or Very Attractive rating  whereas every other sector has at least nine companies that are Attractive or better 
Low Rates Can t Keep Propping Up Utilities   Dividend Yields Are At Risk
There are two ways for the bubble in Utilities to end  The simplest mechanism would be if interest rates started rising again  This trend would push investors back into bonds and cause the price of Utilities to fall back to a level that better reflects their cash flows and risks 
However  even if interest rates stay low for an extended period of time  Utilities investors are still at risk 
The high dividends that have attracted so many investors to this space are unsustainable  The 75 Utilities companies that we cover have had negative free cash flow in four of the past five years  with a cumulative cash burn of almost  150 billion over that time  The profits simply aren t there to cover the high dividends that investors prize 
In addition  rising equity values for Utilities offsets the advantages that cheap debt has for their cost of capital  Even with interest rates at record lows  the weighted average cost of capital  WACC  for Utilities companies has been rising this year as equity becomes a larger and larger portion of their capital structure 
Where To Turn In The Sector
Unfortunately  many advisors and portfolio managers are stuck with a mandated exposure to the Utilities sector  forcing them to search for a way to hit targeted allocations without jeopardizing client portfolios  While there is only one stock that earns our Attractive or better rating in the sector  there are a couple that are not egregiously overvalued 
UGI Corporation  NYSE UGI  is the most profitable stocks in the sector  with an ROIC of 8   It s also the cheapest with a PEBV of 0 9  In addition  it has delivered three consecutive years of positive free cash flow  which suggests its dividend could be sustainable  On a fundamental basis  it clearly appears to be the best in the sector  Unfortunately  its 2 1  dividend yield might be on the low side for those that require income from their investments 
PPL Corporation  NYSE PPL  is another Utilities stock that has some margin of safety  It has a much higher dividend yield of 4 2   and  like UGI  it has delivered positive free cash flow for three consecutive years  In addition  its price to economic book value of 1 6 is well below the industry average  In part  this seems to be due to overstated concerns about the company s exposure to the UK  even though it is highly hedged to protect against the drop in the pound  Investors needing exposure to the sector should take advantage of this comparatively cheap valuation
