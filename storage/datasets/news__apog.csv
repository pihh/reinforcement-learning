payments Fiscal 2020 GuidanceApogee reaffirmed guidance for fiscal 2020  The company expects revenue growth between 1  and 3   with growth in three of the company s segments  The upside is likely to be offset by decline in Architectural Services on account of execution schedules for backlog projects The company s anticipates operating margin in the range of 8 2 8 6   Improved margins in the Architectural Glass and Architectural Framing Systems segments will be somewhat offset by lower margins in the Architectural Services segment owing to reduced volumes and less favorable project maturity compared with fiscal 2019  Moreover  start up costs related to the strategic growth investment in Architectural Glass  costs associated with supply chain initiatives  and higher corporate costs from higher legal expenses will also impact margins The company projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of  3 00  3 20 and capital expenditures in the band of  60  65 million Price

22042,243557,APOG,What Makes Apogee  APOG  A Strong Sell ,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Apogee Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ APOG    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  further confirms weakness in APOG A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen one estimate moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revision  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from  3 01 per share a month ago to its current level of  2 22 Also  for the current quarter  Apogee has seen one downward estimate revision versus no revision in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to 35 cents a share from 92 cents over the past 30 days The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 15 5  in the past month Apogee Enterprises  Inc  Price and Consensus   So  it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Industrial Products sector  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Tennant Company   NYSE TNC    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and may be a better selection at this time  You can see Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance  Our recent biotech recommendations have produced gains of  98    119  and  164  in as little as 1 month  The stocks in this report could perform even better ,2019-12-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-apogee-apog-a-strong-sell-200495464,200495464
22043,243558,APOG,Spotify  Apogee Enterprises  Costco  Tesla And Microsoft Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 30  2019    Shares of Spotify   NYSE SPOT   as the Bull of the Day  Apogee Enterprises   NASDAQ APOG   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Costco   NASDAQ COST    Tesla   NASDAQ TSLA   and Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Shares of Spotify have surged 35  in the last three months and it crushed Q3 Wall Street estimates  posting surprise positive earnings  Spotify has also continued to expand its paid subscriber base in a crowded streaming music market and focused on new ways to grow Spotify s Playlist Spotify helped jump start the paid streaming music space back in 2008 that has helped reinvigorate a music industry that long feared illegal downloads would take over  In fact  streaming represents roughly 80  of recorded music sales  according to industry reports  and Spotify is the world s largest streaming music company Spotify beat Q3 2019 top and bottom line estimates at the end of October and reported adjusted earnings of   0 41 per share  which destroyed our Zacks estimate that called for a loss of   0 40 per share The streaming music powerhouse also posted its 8th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow  And SPOT saw its total monthly active users jump 30  to 248 million  which outpaced the high end of its own guidance More importantly  the company s vital Premium Subscribers who pay monthly fees for ad free music surged 31  to 113 million  The growth was driven by the continued success of its  14 99 a month Family Plan and the  4 99 month Student Plans  This user expansion has helped curb some of Wall Street s worries that Spotify s much larger tech titan peers would make things far harder on the much smaller firm Tech Giant Competition Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Music has grown in popularity  but luckily for Spotify the iPhone giant hasn t tired to undercut its pricing models with both their individual premium plans coming in at  9 99 per month  Meanwhile  Amazon s premium streaming music service hasn t gained as much steam as Jeff Bezos might have hoped Overall  Spotify has been able to grow in the crowded and lucrative streaming music space compared to its rivals  Last quarter  Spotify said   relative to Apple  the publicly available data shows that we are adding roughly twice as many subscribers per month as they are  Additionally  we believe that our monthly engagement is roughly 2x as high and our churn is at half the rate   Spotify boasted similar claims about its superiority to Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Investors should also note that Spotify has invested heavily in its podcast business over the last year and it is now the second largest player in the growing market behind only Apple  SPOT plans to increase its podcast unit to help bring in more advertising dollars as the division only accounts for 10  of its ad revenue  It is worth noting that 90  of the company s total revenue currently comes from its non ad supported Premium business But the Stockholm headquartered firm s paid users still hear ads through podcasts that have ads as part of their own separate business model   We continue to see exponential growth in podcast hours streamed  up approximately 39  Q Q  and early indications that podcast engagement is driving a virtuous cycle of increased overall engagement and significantly increased conversion of free to paid users   Spotify wrote in prepared Q3 remarks Other FundamentalsSpotify went public in April of 2018 and found early success  Then SPOT stock fell from August 2018 until near the end of the year  Shares of SPOT are now up 34  in 2019  35  in the last 12 weeks  and 6  in the past month  all of which outpace the S P 500 s average climbs Clearly  Spotify is still a growth stock  with its valuation still pretty out of whack as it spends to expand  But Wall Street seems okay with its focus on expansion in a crowded and growing space  Meanwhile  SPOT holds a  B  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system and it is part of an industry that rests in the top 30  of our more than 250 Zacks industries Outlook   Earnings TrendsSpotify s Q4 fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to jump 22 6  to  2 09 billion  based on our current Zacks estimates  Spotify reports its sales in euros   Looking further ahead  SPOT s full year fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to surge roughly 28  to reach  7 56 billion  with 2020 projected to come in nearly 25  higher at  9 43 billion For reference  Spotify s full year fiscal 2018 revenue climbed 28 5   which shows that the firm s top line growth is expected to churn along at a solid pace At the bottom end of the income statement  the firm s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to tumble from   0 41 per share to   0 48  Plus  Spotify s full year earnings are expected to sink from   0 60 to   0 90 a share as it spends on expansion  Then  peeking ahead  SPOT s fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS figure is projected to improve significantly to a   0 50 loss We can also see just how much more positive Spotify s adjusted earnings outlook appears  The firm s full year fiscal 2019 estimate is up 50  in the last 60 days and 73  over this same stretch for 2020 Bottom LineSpotify s strong upward earnings revision trends help the firm earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  at the moment  SPOT does face tough competition  but growth focused tech investors might want to take a bite out of Spotify because of its ability to thrive in an industry that looks poised to expand for years to come  Apogee Enterprisesis a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and it is the Bear of the Day today   Let s take a look at why this stock has fallen to the lowest Zacks Rank and became the Bear DescriptionApogee Enterprises is a leader in technologies for the design and development of value added glass products  services  and systems  The company operates under four segments  with three of the segments serving the commercial construction market The Architectural Glass segment  25  of total revenues in fiscal 2019  fabricates glass used in customized window and wall systems forming the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings  The segment consists of Viracon  a fabricator of coated  high performance architectural glass for global markets  Its markets include the U S  government  offices  education  health care and hotels Recent EarningsThe most recent quarter was a big miss of the Zacks Consensus Estimate   The company reported  0 57 in EPS when the estimate was calling for  0 76   That 19 cent difference translates to a negative earnings surprise of 25  The company also lowered guidance when they reported and that is the reason that estimates took a tumble Estimates FallWhen earnings estimates fall  the Zacks Rank tends to fall as well   The movement in earnings estimates is the single biggest factor that influences the Rank  so when a company lowers guidance you can rest assured that the Rnak will slide APOG saw estimates for the current quarter slide from 98 cents to 84 cents   The full year 2019 number fell from  3 04 to  2 84   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 slid from  3 57 to  3 35 as well ValuationAt 11x forward estimates the stock looks pretty attractive after taking a steep drop   This stock has been a good one for a long time  so this reduction in guidance is something that needs to be explored in a deeper fashion   Sure the estimates fell and that pushed the Rank down  but there could be a bigger problem or it could be a buying opportunity   I am going to keep this stock on my radar screen and see how next quarter comes

22107,243622,APOG,Should Value Investors Choose Apogee  APOG  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Apogee Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ APOG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value  oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Apogee Enterprises has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 34  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 09  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Apogee Enterprises  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 17 9 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Materials Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 87  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Apogee Enterprises has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 84  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Apogee Enterprises  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Apogee Enterprises has a P S ratio of about 0 69  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 19 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Apogee Enterprises currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Apogee Enterprises a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Apogee Enterprises is just 1 18  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 21  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  APOG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Apogee Enterprises might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and Momentum Score of A  This gives APOG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at the best  As a result  the current year consensus estimate declined 0 33  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate fell 1 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Apogee Enterprises  Inc  Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineApogee Enterprises is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 9  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next

Though the recent rally in sterling this week  trading near Monday s six month highs of 1 4782 against the dollar  suggested that markets were betting that the Remain camp would claim victory over a Brexit  as the vote to leave the EU is known  in Thursday s U K  referendum on its membership in the European Union  EU

U S  financial markets were watching developments closely with concern over the impact if a Brexit came to pass 
Both  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  and UBS warned in notes released Wednesday that a vote by the U K  to leave  while having a more dire effect on London s FTSE 100  could also drive the S P 500 down by 7 5  or 9   respectively 
Meanwhile  Yellen repeated her semi annual testimony given on Tuesday to the Senate for the benefit of the House Committee on Financial Services 
As in the prior day s remarks  Yellen repeated that there was uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook but the Fed anticipated a gradual increase in rate hikes 
She also fingered the rebalancing of China s economy and Thursday s U K  referendum as the major external risks 
With that in mind  attention would focus on Yellen s June 29 appearance at the European Central Bank s conference to see how her views on monetary policy might change after the British people make their decision on whether they will remain or leave the EU 
Among other Fed officials speaking on Wednesday  Fed governor Jerome Powell insisted that U S  central bank was  ready for whatever happens  in Thursday s vote  while Fed vice president Stanley Fischer focused only on the progress on  too big to fail  regulation

22186,243701,APOG,Apogee Reshaping Business Mix To Deliver Stable Results,opinion,During second quarter fiscal 2018 conference call  Apogee Enterprises  Inc  s   NASDAQ APOG   Chief Executive Officer  Joe F  Puishys highlighted that the company is in the process of reshaping business mix to deliver more stable performance through any economic cycle  Its recent acquisitions of Sotawall and EFCO are likely to facilitate these efforts  The company is also poised to deliver growth in the next few years driven by robust backlog  order activity and growth in commercial construction Apogee is a leader in technologies for design and development of value added glass products  services and systems and falls under the Zacks  industry  The company reported earnings per share of 60 cents in second quarter fiscal 2018  down 22  from 77 cents per share recorded in the prior year quarter  The company reported total revenues of  344 million  up around 24  year over year  on the back of growth in Architectural Framing Systems revenues Segments Poised for GrowthEnabled by the Sotawall and EFCO acquisitions  the Architectural Framing Systems segment delivered a whopping 105  growth in revenues in the reported quarter  It is currently the company s largest segment  contributing 53  of revenues  It is expected to be Apogee s fastest growing and highest margin architectural segment as well as the most stable performer across the economic cycles As part of Apogee s transformation strategy  the Architectural Glass segment  will now deal with large and midsize projects rather than predominantly large projects  The company is witnessing double digit growth in the midsize project sector  which tends to be more stable than the very large projects in all economic conditions Meanwhile  Puishys noted that the Architectural Services segment s contribution has trickled down to 14  of total revenues in the reported quarter from 25  contribution five years ago  It is a volatile business as it executes a small number of large dollar projects and timing of work is dependent on job site schedules that often fluctuate  Nevertheless  it continues to generate the highest Return in Invested Capital  ROIC  for Apogee  The company plans to deliver segment margin improvement through careful project selection rather than focus on projects with top line growth at low margins Coming to other segment   Large scale Optical segment will continue to generate the highest margins  The company foresees growth opportunities in engineered optics that value antireflective properties for both glass and acrylic products  The company is receiving initial orders in automotive and signage applications which hold promise Growth through AcquisitionsOver the last six months  Apogee acquired two companies   Sotawall and EFCO  Sotawall  will contribute to Apogee s revenues and margin growth in commercial construction markets that are anticipated to grow through fiscal 2020  The EFCO acquisition will help in expanding Apogee s presence in the midsized commercial buildings  broaden product offerings and enhance geographic presence across the United States  The acquisitions will aid Apogee build a more diversified portfolio  which offers greater long term growth opportunities Promising Guidance for Fiscal 2018  2019Apogee projects fiscal 2018 full year revenue growth of between 24  and 26   This will translate to revenues of  1 4 billion  higher than the milestone of  1 billion in revenues achieved for the first time a year back  Earnings per share are expected to lie between  3 40 and  3 60  reflecting a year over year growth of 15   The guidance factors in lower revenue and margins due to some larger projects with higher costs that EFCO will be delivering in second half fiscal 2018 The company remains optimistic about backlog  awards and bidding  For fiscal 2019  Apogee anticipates double digit revenue growth and triple digit operating margin improvement  backed by order pipeline and backlog already booked for fiscal 2019 Apogee continues to expect mid single digit growth in U S  commercial construction as market activity  the Architecture Billings Index  ABI   office employment and office vacancy rates exhibit a positive momentum  The ABI has been at 50 or better for 21 of the last 24 months  indicating sustainable growth in architectural activity as a score above 50 represents an increase in billings from the previous month  With internal market visibility from backlog  commitments and bidding activity along with external metrics moving in the right direction  the company foresees continued market growth for the next few years Along with Apogee  companies like NCI Building Systems Inc    NYSE NCS   and Armstrong World Industries  Inc    NYSE AWI    Beacon Roofing Supply Inc    NASDAQ BECN   will gain from strength in U S  commercial construction markets Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s

22449,243964,APOG,Should Value Investors Consider Apogee Enterprises  APOG  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Apogee Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ APOG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Apogee Enterprises has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 66  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 17  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Apogee Enterprises  current PE ratio way below its midpoint  which is 32 45  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Industrial Products sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 52  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Apogee Enterprises has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 19  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Apogee Enterprises stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Apogee Enterprises has a P S ratio of about 1 40  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 13 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Apogee Enterprises currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes APOG a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Apogee Enterprises might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives APOG a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by about 11 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has climbed about 9 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Apogee Enterprises  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineApogee Enterprises is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  top 5  out of more than 250 industries  and strong Zacks Rank  Apogee Enterprises looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Glass Products sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this

22584,244099,APOG,5 Efficient Stocks Poised To Fetch Significant Returns,opinion,"Companies with a favorable efficiency level have always been on investors  radar due to their potential to perform better than others  A company that is capable of converting its input into outputs efficiently generally attracts investors  attention  Thus investing in efficient companies is likely to provide solid yield in any market conditions 
Key Efficiency Ratios
In order to measure the efficiency level of a company  one must consider the efficiency ratios  The popular ones are 
Inventory Turnover  The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory is considered as one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is suffering from weak sales  which resulted in excess inventory  
Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers 
Asset Utilization  This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert its assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4 quarter average of total assets  Like the above two ratios  high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient 
Operating Margin  This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control its operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers 
As efficiency level varies across different industries  it is best to select those stocks that have higher ratios compared to their industries  Along with higher ratios  we have considered only those stocks that have either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  in order to make the strategy more profitable 
Screening Parameters
Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average   The value of these ratios higher than industry averages indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers     
Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through 
The use of these very few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 700stocks to only 22 
Here are five of the 22 stocks 
Lantheus Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ LNTH   is involved in developing  manufacturing  selling and distributing diagnostic medical imaging agents and products for diagnosis of cardiovascular and other diseases  This Zacks Rank  1 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of more than 100  
The Home Depot  Inc    NYSE HD   is one of the world s largest home improvement retailers  The company offers a level of service unprecedented among warehouse style retailers  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 4 2  
Neenah Paper  Inc    NYSE NP   is a leading global specialty materials company  focused on premium niche markets that include advanced filtration media  specialized substrates and premium printing and packaging papers  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 9 8  
Illinois Tool Works Inc    NYSE ITW   manufactures and markets a variety of products and systems that provide specific  problem solving solutions for a diverse customer base worldwide  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 2 6  
Apogee Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ APOG   is a leader in technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products and services  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 9 8  
While backtesting over a two year timeframe  Aug  1  2014 to Aug  5  2016   considering a four week holding period  a portfolio following this strategy provided a total return of 15 9  compared with the S P 500 s return of 9 3   Thus this strategy may prove to be profitable for investors seeking healthy returns

22589,244104,APOG,4 Stocks To Catch The Industrial Production Recovery,opinion,"Industrial production rebounded in September from a decline in August  adding to the tally of encouraging economic data signifying improvement in the U S  economy during the third quarter  The Federal Reserve reported that the increase in industrial production during the third quarter was the best in the year so far  Rise in manufacturing and mining outputs played a crucial role in boosting overall industrial production last month 
Rebound in Industrial Production
Industrial production rose 0 1  last month  rebounding from 0 5  decline in August on the back of 0 2  gain in manufacturing and 0 4  increase in mining productions  Moreover  industrial production during the last quarter rose at an annual pace of 1 8   the highest since the third quarter of 2015  Strong gains in utilities production despite a decline last month and a rise in manufacturing output primarily boosted industrial production last quarter  Utilities and manufacturing outputs registered gains of 0 9  and 6 2  during the third quarter  respectively 
Among the major market groups  it was non industrial supplies that primarily led industrial production higher   It was also boosted by a strong rebound in construction output  After falling 1 4  in August  production at the construction segment rose 0 8  last month  Separately  capacity utilization rose to 75 4  last month from 75 3  registered in August  While capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector rose 0 1  to 74 9  in September  the same in the mining segment increased 0 5  to 75 5  
Will the Rebound Sustain 
Though up slightly in September  capacity utilizations remain significantly below the long term  1972 2015  average of 80 0   This is an indication that there is enough room for the economy to expand its capacity in order to boost industrial production further in the days ahead  However  it will entirely depend on near term prospects of the U S  economy  Recent economic data including ISM Manufacturing Index and factory orders signal toward improvement in the U S  economy in the second half of the year 
The ISM Manufacturing Index increased 2 1 percentage points to a level of 51 5  during the month of September  The reading exceeded the level of 49 4  registered during the month of August  Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing activity  Strong gains in new orders led manufacturing activity to rebound last month  Additionally  factory orders rose 0 2  in August after advancing 1 4  in July  Though non farm payrolls decreased last month  the labor market remained on a strong footing 
Separately  other economic data including nine year high consumer confidence and strong gain in retail sales also indicate that the economy is rebounding  These positive indications along with a recovery in oil prices in recent times have left little doubt about the sustainability of last month s rebound

22603,244118,APOG,Look Beyond Profits  Bet On 5 Stocks With Rising Cash Flows,opinion,In the impending second quarter earnings season  one would find it easier to crunch profit numbers and evaluate surprises to scoop up big gains  But a company s profit doesn t necessarily channelize to the reserves to fund future growth  In fact  a profit making company can have a deficiency of cash flow and go bankrupt while meeting its obligations Therefore  to ensure that one is investing in the right stocks  a look at the company s ability to produce cash is warranted  Cash gives a company the flexibility to make decisions  the means to make potential investments and the fuel to run its growth engine  Cash also shields a company from market turmoil In any business  money flows in and out  but net cash flow indicates how much money the company is actually generating or burning  Having positive cash flows indicates enhanced liquidity  giving the company more means for debt repayment  expenses  dividend payouts  stock buyback and finally reinvestment in business  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies that a company s liquid assets are decreasing  resulting in reduced flexibility to support these moves  So putting your hard earned money in stocks with less cash does not make any sense at all However  positive cash flows alone are not sufficient to predict a company s future growth  If the cash flow is increasing over time  it indicates a company s competency in growing  In fact  rising cash flow implies management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements  reaping more money from its business  depending less on outside financing and finally its improving fundamentals So  while picking stocks this earnings season  don t look at profits only  Make sure to look for stocks with dependable and increasing cash flows Screening Parameters To find out stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time  we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5 year average cash flow per common share  This implies a positive trend and increasing cash over a period of time In addition to this  we chose Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance Average Broker Rating 1  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the company s future performance Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  of B or better  This score is also of great assistance in selecting stocks  Importantly  this scoring system helps in picking winning stocks in their individual industry categories Here are five out of 10 stocks that made it through the screen Apogee Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ APOG   is a leader in technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products and services  The company is based in Minneapolis  MN

22605,244120,APOG,Buy 5 Momentum Picks That Brokers Love,opinion,"Given a series of external forces that kept the U S  economy in doldrums over the recent past  the market was eagerly waiting for some kind of impetus to push the economy uphill  And it came in the form of a sharp rebound in the U S  jobs market  The June jobs report last Friday sent most of the indices skyward 
According to a CNBC news   The U S  economy added a better than expected 287 000 jobs last month  well up from the 11 000 in May  in a sign it had regained speed after a brief lull  
Bullish Jobs Report Sends Markets Soaring
This had a tonic effect on the stock market with the Dow Jones industrial average rising to a record high at the close of the Jun 12 session  Although NASDAQ is still lagging at this moment  the S P 500 index that was too fragile to show any strong signs of gain over the past one year  is finally on a new high  At yesterday s close  this index was trading at 2 152  Notably  apart from its previous day s close  the S P 500 index has failed to breach the 2 130 level since mid May 2015 
Are We Cheering Just a Little Too Early 
It seems like the market has completely put behind it the plunge suffered from the shocking Brexit vote  However  one cannot expect this single factor   the June jobs report   to overpower all other recent commotions the U S  market has been subject to  including the Fed s interest rate concerns  low oil prices  sluggish emerging market scenario and upcoming political game changing factors 
Though the Brexit effect seems to be fading away  we are on the cusp of a lackluster second quarter earnings season  with the bottom line expected to decline by  
At this point when there is a lack of clarity about the direction of the market and when sustainable development is still a matter of question  the ideal investment strategy is to go for momentum stocks  In other words  when the market sentiment is erratic  it s best to forget about long term growth and value investing  Instead  the emphasis should be on short term gains driven by favorable movement in the stock price and possibilities of a further rise in the days ahead  In a nutshell  don t hold the stock  get in  make profit and get out is the mantra 
In fact it will be a wiser decision if you pick those momentum stocks which are also strongly preferred by most of its covering analysts

22606,244121,APOG,Top 5 Stocks Exhibiting Significant Relative Price Strength,opinion,Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average On such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands At the same time  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better performance than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1

22609,244124,APOG,Look Beyond Earnings  5 Stocks With Increasing Cash Flows ,opinion,We are in the busiest week of the current reporting cycle  and crunching profit numbers and evaluating surprises might seem appropriate right now for investors  But looking beyond the profits and figuring out whether they are being efficiently channeled to the company s reserves can be a lot more rewarding  This

looking at a company s ability to produce cash is important in terms of protecting your money in addition to multiplying it No doubt  cash moves in and out of any business  but it is net cash flow that indicates how much money a company is actually generating  A positive cash flow denotes an increase in the company s liquid assets  which gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the flip side  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  a company can competently grow only when this positive cash flow is rising  as increasing cash flow indicates management s efficiency in generating more cash from its business and less dependence on outside financing So  while picking stocks this earnings season  don t look at profits only  Make sure to look for stocks with dependable and increasing cash flows Screening Parameters To find out stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time  we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least

Chanticleer Holdings Inc  NASDAQ HOTR  had an exceptional day on Thursday  up 43 cents to 2 94  or 17   on 1 million shares  It opened at 2 51  rocketed to 2 97  and closed at 2 94  The one minute charts shows how it popped  flagged  and pulled back slightly at the end of the day  closing at 2 94  This is the highest close this stock has had since the middle of 2014  More importantly  the volume picked up the last two days  Look for it to run up to 3 30 as early as Friday  There s double resistance there so it could pull back  but if it extends  it could reach up to 3 75  If you re trading short term  look for 3 30  75  intermediate term the target is 5 5 3 4 
TASER International Inc  NASDAQ TASR  had an awesome day on Thursday  up 2 24 to 27 40  or 8 9   on 5 2 million shares  The pullback  and a retest of the pullback  led to 5 days up  and then on Thursday  it gapped and ran  closing at the highest level it s closed in a long time  It needs to get over 28 1 4  The next target is 32 
Voltari Corporation  VLTC  surged to a 52 week high on Thursday on news that Icahn continues to invest  This stock has a steep angle of ascent  pulling back on low volume and popping on big volume  It looks like it can get to 7 3 4  so the next target is 71 2 3 4
