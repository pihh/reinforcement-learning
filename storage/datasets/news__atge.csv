11837,233352,ATGE,Is Adtalem Global  ATGE  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Adtalem Global Education Inc    NYSE ATGE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Adtalem Global has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Adtalem Global s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Schools industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 55 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Adtalem Global has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s arnings  of just 17 3  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Adtalem Global stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Adtalem Global has a P S ratio of about 1 7  This is far lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 7 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Adtalem Global currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Adtalem Global a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 11 4  which is far better than the industry average of 15 2  Clearly  ATGE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Adtalem Global might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of F  This gives ATGE a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty sicouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimates to go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen no upward and three downward movements in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 19  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has gone down by 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Adtalem Global Education Inc  Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAdtalem Global is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 20  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past six months  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breaking News  Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed  700 billion   more than a 3 800  increase in the previous 12 months  They re now bigger than Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and even Visa  The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved Zacks  has

11870,233385,ATGE,3 For Profit Education Stocks To Buy Post Q1 Earnings,opinion,For profit education companies lacked sheen in the last few years and the March quarter was no exception  The dismal scene can be traced back to lower student demand  regulatory restrictions  serious threats to federal funding and a competitive environment  So much so that prospective students are still reluctant to take loans for a higher degree Prominent players in the sector like DeVry Education Group Inc    NYSE DV    Universal Technical Institute  Inc    NYSE UTI   and American Public Education  Inc    NASDAQ APEI   are struggling with fading enrollments trends  Rising cost of necessities like health care  housing and education is crowding out discretionary spending for consumers Moreover  the U S  economy grew at its weakest pace in three years in the first quarter as consumer spending barely increased  The slow economic recovery coupled with gradual strengthening of the labor markets make it difficult for for profit companies to attract students preferring education to jobs Nevertheless  the big reason for choosing to invest in for profit education stocks now is Betsy DeVos  President Trump s Secretary of Education  She is considered the most business friendly person to hold the position since the Department of Education was created by Jimmy Carter in 1979 In fact  the U S  presidential election had a positive impact on the school industry as shares of for profit education companies rallied post Trump s victory  Trump has assured to support schools  confirming federal funding for online companies  He has even committed to ease regulations imposed on the industry by the Obama administration With changing times  for profit education companies are coming up with ad campaigns  investing in digital capabilities and stepping up social media efforts to increase their brand value as well as boost enrollment growth  The for profits are also forging corporate and community college partnerships to educate their workforce  Additionally  companies are improving their technology and infrastructure  increasing investments to improve the academic quality and retain students  buying complementary businesses and regularly introducing new programs and specializations to boost student outcomes In order to improve profits  companies like DeVry and Universal Technical Institute have resorted to aggressive cost cutting measures through significant layoffs and campus closings Schools with Promising PerformancesA few for profit schools such as Capella Education Company   NASDAQ CPLA   are thriving  beating estimates on both counts in the first quarter of 2017  Although the company s earnings decreased year over year  revenues improved  driven by positive enrollment levels recorded at Capella University Strayer Education s   NASDAQ STRA   first quarter earnings meet analysts  expectations  The company s revenues increased 3 3   primarily buoyed by 6

11871,233386,ATGE,Guess   GES  Slips To Sell  What s Wrong With The Stock ,opinion,"In order to cushion their portfolio  it is important for investors to exit underperforming stocks  which may dent their portfolio returns  Well  apparel retailer Guess  Inc    NYSE GES   seems to be one such underachiever that needs to be plucked out of investors  stock garden immediately 
The shares of this apparel retailer which carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  have declined 27 1  so far this year  underperforming the Zacks Categorized Textile Apparel Manufacturing market  which has reported a decline of 8 2   Let s delve deeper to find out what s weighing upon investor sentiment 

What s Wrong with Guess  
Guess  has been reporting lackluster results for quite some time  In fact the stock missed earnings in three of the last four trailing quarter  This is reflected in the fact that the stock has been witnessing downward estimate revisions since the past 60 days  During the recently reported third quarter fiscal 2017 results released on Nov 30  2016  earnings of 11 cents per share missed Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as year ago results by 21 4  and 26 7   respectively 
Further earnings came in at the lower end of the management s projected earnings range of 11 16 cents  The dismal performance weighed upon the stock and its price dipped 10 2  on Dec 1  a day after the company released its earnings   Read   
Notably  Guess  lowered its earnings outlook for fiscal 2017  to reflect lower comps and gross margin in the Americas Retail segment  It now estimates adjusted earnings per share in the range of 42 52 cents compared with 62 75 cents expected previously  This compares unfavorably with 96 cents per share reported in fiscal 2016  Further  the company lowered its revenue growth outlook and now anticipates net revenue to rise in the range of 1  and 2  in constant currency compared to a range of 2 5  to 4 5  expected earlier 
Apart from this  Guess  remains susceptible to macroeconomic headwinds like increased payroll taxes  fluctuating fuel prices  risk of unemployment and delayed tax refunds  Additionally  the company has been witnessing lackluster traffic in North America 
Guess  is strategically focusing on expansion in Asia and expects long term growth in the region  However  a soft macroeconomic condition in Greater China is slowing the company s growth in Asia  Lower consumer spending owing to uncertain economic environment along with falling exports and slow growth in industrial production  retail sales and construction activity is denting Guess  sales growth in the country GUESS INC Price

   Additionally  its business is heavily dependent on the tastes and preferences of consumers that keep changing with time  Consequently  the failure to identify consumer needs and act accordingly may reduce demand for its products and weigh on its financial performance

11898,233413,ATGE,Hanesbrands  HBI  Slips To Sell  What s Taking It Down ,opinion,"In order to cushion their portfolio  it is important for investors to exit underperforming stocks  which may dent their portfolio returns  Well  basic apparel retailer Hanesbrands Inc    NYSE HBI   seems to be one such underachiever that needs to be plucked out of investors  stock garden immediately 
This Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock has declined 19 2   underperforming the Zacks Textile Apparel Mfg market  which has showcased a decline of 5 1    Let s delve deeper to find out what s weighing upon investor sentiment 

What s Wrong with Hanesbrands 
Hanesbrands has been witnessing downward estimate revisions since it released lower than expected top line results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 on Nov 27  2016  Although the company posted in line earnings  top line marginally missed Zacks Estimate by 0 25   Lower year over year growth in the Activewear and Direct to Consumer segments resulted in the soft to in line results during the quarter   Read   
Notably  Hanesbrands has lowered the higher end of its fiscal top and bottom line outlook to reflect the soft results in the year to date period  For 2016  Hanesbrands anticipates adjusted earnings in the range of  1 89  1 92 per share compared to  1 89  1 95 expected previously  The company anticipates sales between  6 15 billion and  6 18 billion compared to  6 15 billion and  6 25 billion projected earlier  Hanesbrands estimates operating profit in the range of  940 million to  955 million compared to the range of  940 million to  975 million anticipated previously HANESBRANDS INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Apart from this  Hanesbrands remains prone to macroeconomic headwinds like increased payroll taxes  fluctuating fuel prices  risk of unemployment and delayed tax refunds  Further  Hanesbrands  limited exposure to international markets makes it more susceptible to these factors  Moreover  the company unlike its peers does not have any manufacturing facilities in key growth markets like Asia and Latin America where labor is relatively cheaper 
Additionally  its business is heavily dependent on the tastes and preferences of consumers that keep changing with time  Hence  the failure to identify consumer needs and act accordingly may reduce demand for its products and weigh on its financial performance 
Further  the company s strategy to focus more on premium brands and increase prices in these categories come with the inherent risk of consumers shifting to more competitively priced brands offered by competitors

11913,233428,ATGE,5 Low Price to Cash Flow Stocks For Assured Returns,opinion,Investors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks  But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you know the magic trick When it comes to the investment market  experts consider value style as one of the best approaches  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So  the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest considering Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  as one of the key metrics  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health A question may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric  when the most widely used metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  what makes P CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly reflecting the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves What s the Optimum Strategy However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should give you even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified

11929,233444,ATGE,5 Low Price to Sales Stocks Poised For Big Returns,opinion,While Price to Earnings is the first to cross one s mind when using valuation metrics  Price to Sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are suffering losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits Though a loss making company with a negative Price to Earnings ratio falls out of investors  favor  its Price to Sales could indicate the hidden strength in its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify recovery situations or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to Sales is often preferred to Price to Earnings  as companies and managements can fiddle with their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable A stock s Price to Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the Price to Sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So it goes without saying that a stock with Price to Sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower Price to Sales ratio is more suitable for investment versus a stock with a high Price to Sales ratio However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price to Sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price to Sales ratio In any case  the Price to Sales ratio used in isolation can t do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book  Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the Price to Sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry  A company with less debt should have a stable Price to Sales

Blue Buffalo Pet Products  Inc   NASDAQ BUFF  formed a flag or pennant about a week ago  I put a swing trade on it  and it popped out on Tuesday  up 29 cents to 23 70  or 1 24   on 802 000 shares traded  It was only up a small fraction  but on a bad day that s not too bad  It looks to me like it wants to go  When it does  the targets are 27 and 29 going forward

Stocks started the session down  a little over 150 points  then rallied and turned positive  then the Fed released its policy statement to wrap up its two day FOMC meeting  and stocks fell again  350 points from peak to trough  even though there was no surprise in the statement 
The Federal Reserve statement had a few changes from the last statement  First  there was no change in interest rates   as expected  The Fed says it expects the economy will continue to warrant only gradual rate increases   as expected  They will closely monitor global economic and financial developments   a soft backpedal from December  when they said risks were balanced  Not a big surprise 
Inflation is expected to remain low because oil prices are down  but that won t last forever   yeah  yeah  The strong dollar is a bit of a drag  Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year   an acknowledgement that economic growth slowed  well that s different 
Their confidence in the economy has eroded since December  Not exactly  The Fed also noted the strength of some economic measuring sticks  including continued job growth  more spending by businesses and consumers  and the revival of the housing market 
All in all  the Fed statement was expected  So why did the market selloff  Well  they didn t rule out another rate hike at the March 16 FOMC meeting  they didn t commit to a hike either  So  go figure  and while you figure  sell something 
Purchases of new U S  homes surged in December to the highest level in 10 months  closing out the best year for housing since 2007  Sales jumped 10 8 percent last month  the most since August 2014  to a 544 000 annualized pace  For all of 2015  purchases of new properties climbed 14 6 percent to 501 000  The warmest December on record probably played a big role in the stronger than forecast sales gain during the month  but the most basic reason is that demand is outpacing supply 
Puerto Rico plans to meet with creditors on Friday to discuss a possible restructuring of  70 billion of municipal bonds  The talks come as the island struggles to make progress on two tracks   striking deals with bondholders and persuading U S  legislators that it merits relief from the federal government  Further complicating the process  the territory has more than a dozen types of bonds and is negotiating simultaneously with several creditor groups that have competing claims 
Facebook  O FB  reported another quarter of soaring revenue  Sales rose 52 percent from a year earlier to  5 84 billion on the strength of its mobile advertising business and an increase in daily users  Profit rose to  1 56 billion  more than doubling from a year earlier  The numbers far surpassed Wall Street s expectations of  1 2 billion in profit on  5 37 billion in revenue  Facebook reported after the close  and shares jumped in after hours trade

Three major U S  shale oil firms announced big cuts to their 2016 capital spending plans yesterday in a bid to survive  30 a barrel oil prices  with one of them saying prices would need to rise more than 20  just to turn a profit  The cuts from Hess Corp  N HES   Continental Resources  N CLR  and Noble Energy  N NBL  ranged from 40  to 66   marking the second straight year of pullbacks by a trio of businesses normally seen as among the most resilient shale oil producers  The American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported that crude supplies climbed by 11 4 million barrels for the week ended Jan  22 
Since passage of the last major energy law  in 2007  the United States has gone from fears of oil and gas shortages to becoming the world s leading producer of both fuels  The use of wind and solar power is rapidly accelerating as those sources become cheaper than fossil fuels in some parts of the country  And President Obama s clean air regulations are reshaping the nation s power systems  as electric utilities shutter coal fired power plants and replace them with alternative sources 
But the nation s energy infrastructure has not kept pace with those changes  And so Congress today started debating a comprehensive energy bill for the first time in more than 8 years  Right now  Congress is just talking and they might not do anything 
Just hours after senators began debating the bill  it came under attack by both liberal and conservative advocacy groups  In a letter to senators  the Sierra Club complained that the bill s section on energy efficiency in buildings would actually roll back some existing efficiency standards 
Americans for Limited Government  a conservative group  urged lawmakers to reject the bill  In a letter  the group wrote   There is no excuse for the Senate to move forward with legislation that continues the practice of picking energy winners and losers  expands federal government authority and fails to turn control of federal lands back to the states  
California regulators are set to decide how much rooftop solar customers can get for selling their excess clean energy  The California Public Utilities Commission will consider a proposal about continuing a policy called net metering  which requires utilities to pay rooftop solar customers the full retail rate for electricity they put onto the grid 
The solar industry has been largely supportive of the proposed measure while the state s investor owned utilities have called it unfair and say it means people who don t have solar systems are subsidizing those who do  so they want to pay less  Seems the utilities don t want to pay for electricity  I know the feeling 
Meredith Corp   N MDP  walked away from its attempt to merge with Media General  N MEG   that opens the door for Nexstar Broadcasting Group  O NXST  to proceed with its plan to acquire the TV station owner after months of negotiation  Meredith  the owner of broadcast stations and magazines like Better Homes and Gardens  agreed to a termination package that includes a  60 million breakup fee 
Media General initially agreed to acquire Meredith for  2 4 billion in September  Nexstar later offered to buy Media General  eventually reaching an agreement for about  2 3 billion  But that deal couldn t move forward until Meredith released Media General from its commitment

Meanwhile  Google s secretive drone delivery project could include a component designed to store packages securely  A patent filed Tuesday in the United States  describes a  delivery receptacle  designed to take packages from an  aerial delivery device  for deposit to a secure location  The receptacle would use infrared beacons to connect with drones in the air and then guide them for delivery 
FedEx  N FDX  announced a new share repurchase program covering up to 25 million shares   3 billion at current prices   The question is what will they do when the drones take over

In December  Hayes was sentenced to 11 years  A dozen banks have been fined about  9 billion by global authorities over the last four years in relation to the manipulation of Libor  So  there you have it  Tom Hayes rigged a multi trillion dollar marketplace all by his lonesome  resulting in billions of dollars of fines  no executives knew anything or helped this mid level trader  just Tom  Now move along  move along  nothing more to see ",2016-01-28,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lonesome-tom-and-tom-alone-382004,382004

11952,233467,ATGE,Post Election Investing Observations,opinion,As the election winds down  what can we expect from the markets based upon who wins  What opportunities exist and what should our investment philosophy be  Sectors that do well under Romney A good place to invest may be stocks in the financial and education sector if Romney is elected  because these groups stand to benefit  Mark Flannery of Credit Suisse describes it this way   While we do not expect a repeal of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  a more  balanced  approach to bank supervision and future bank reforms are likely to be viewed favorably  We think a Republican administration would be a positive for bank stocks  Under Obama s watch in 2012  the education sector dropped 45  as the administration redid the federal student aid program  If Obama has a second term  another round of initiatives will cut into earnings for these companies  But if Romney wins  these initiatives will not take place and companies like DeVry Inc  DV  and Bridgepoint Education  BPI  just to name a few  will be able to rebound  Another sector that could prosper if Romney wins is managed healthcare  He has promised to dismantle Obamacare right away if he wins  There is a 2 3  excise tax medical health care stocks and medical device makers will have to pay under Obamacare  Companies like Wellpoint Inc  WLP  and Life Science Holdings  IART  will benefit under Romney  Watch Deep Sea Drillers Deep Sea Drillers Suffered under Obama after the BP spill in the gulf coast  It s the U S  Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement  which regulates domestic offshore drilling  and after the spill  it restricted the access to new deep sea drilling permits  They went from 106 in 2007 to 32 by 2010  It s the deep sea drillers that have suffered  Gulf drilling companies have seen stock prices fall  But if Romney wins  this may be a good sector to invest in  Romney has stated offshore drilling and additional permits would be the foundation of his new energy policy  Deep sea drillers could see their misfortunes turn to fortunes  These companies have taken a hit the last couple years and could be a  black gold mine   Wealthy will spend More if Romney wins A  that affluent business leaders plan to invest more  spend more and put more money into their businesses if Mitt Romney wins the election  39  of the business leaders would increase investments in their companies if Romney wins while the markets as a whole would increase spending by a third  But if Obama was in for a second term  32  would decrease or hold back investments while 37  in the market as a whole would reduce spending  Regardless of who wins  most investors may be sitting out  Maybe it Doesn t Matter Who Wins More U S   if Republican challenger Mitt Romney wins the presidential election than if President Barack Obama is re elected and they would also take more risk in their investments  Nevertheless  most would stay on the sidelines regardless of who wins because there is major concern with uncertainty  The looming fiscal cliff of automatic spending cuts and tax increases takes place January 1st 2013  unless congress acts  For this reason most investors see themselves in a hold pattern for the immediate future  I am not sure how much our politicians will accomplish  There is a no compromise battle going on in Washington and it is unhealthy for the country and there is no sign hostilities will recede anytime soon  I am not sure if Obama wins  another stimulus of his will do any good  if he can get one through   Can Romney really lower taxes  It will be hard and I am not sure either will be able to spark much growth in the next couple years  It is not logical to consider lowering our outrageous deficit by spending cuts and tax increases  this will just keep the economy moving along at a snails pace  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke continues to print money but all the Fed bailouts  loans  credits  and money printing have done nothing to create long lasting wealth and a healthy economy  Are we headed toward a major global crisis  Will it make a difference whoever is in the White House the next four years  2013 is going to be a challenge for either candidate  The economy is going to be slow going  high unemployment  and high debt  Some economists that have been polled believe the economy could fall another 2  and recession looms close  This belief by some analysts may not be far off from reality  Between 2000 and 2010  Wall Street lost and inflation adjusted 20  in value from retirement portfolios for 95 million Americans  The markets moved between 6400 14 000 and there is no reason it cannot do the same thing now  It is highly unlikely that neither Obama nor Romney will be able to fix the immediate problem in the next four years  So what should an investor do  Get defensive in your investing  We still have political warring going on and it is unlikely to end soon  There wars will continue to drive markets down  Disclosure  I have no positions in any stocks mentioned  and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours  I wrote this article myself  and it expresses my own opinions  I am not receiving compensation for it  other than from Seeking Alpha   I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in

11966,233481,ATGE,What s Working In 2015 ,opinion,"The market has been flat so far 
Doesn t feel like it with all the drama in the headlines  but this just happened 

February was a great month but other than that  it s been up and down 
First  if you want to skip the commentary and jump straight to the spreadsheet list of stocks and data  grab it below by sharing this post 
I use these screens as a personal way to gauge the market as a whole  the screens cover several different strategies  So when I see the majority of the screens under performing the markets  it s a sign that things are tough out there and serves as a reminder to focus on valuation and patience in order to maintain a successful portfolio 
So What s Working in 2015 
Not much according to what I m seeing via the  I follow 
Here are the performances for each value screen at the end of Q2 

The Year of Net Nets 
The  and  are smoking the market at 37  and 34  this year respectively  but there s an issue with the performance 
The first problem is that the NCAV and NNWC aren t tracking a full list of 20 stocks 
The NCAV list started off the year with only 8 stocks while the NNWC started with 12 stocks 
Some keen observers have asked why there are more stocks in the NNWC screen when it s more restrictive  and why all the NNWC stocks aren t included in the NCAV 
If I ran a simple straight selection criteria  there would be more stocks in the NCAV screen  and all the NNWC stocks would be listed in the NCAV list 
However  since I ve created custom criteria for both the NCAV and NNWC  the list is not equal 
The second problem is that both portfolios include Voltari Corp  NASDAQ VLTC   which ended Q2 up 700   It was up 2350  at one point 

But why is this an issue 
If you had a 100k portfolio to start the year and needed to buy  10k worth of VLTC at  0 66 a share  it would have been tough to buy 15k shares as the volume at the beginning of the year was between 30k to 50k shares a day 
That s assuming you were the only one who knew about VLTC 
If my lists were published for all to see  you would be competing to buy the same shares along with 10  20 or 50 other people 
50 x 15k shares per person   750k volume required 
So the lesson here is not to get glittery eyed by big performance numbers as it s hard to replicate 
I try my best to include as much fees and real life deductions as possible in the screens  but there s a limit to how much complexity I can model 
Other screens you see on the net claiming 40   returns YTD are hocus pocus 
Regarding diversification  when it comes to net nets  a portfolio made up of 10 is still too risky unless you do some deep research to make sure a few won t blow up 
For a good mix of net nets  you should have at least 20 because net net stocks by nature aren t high conviction or concentrated bets 
You do well when you buy a basket 
You go bankrupt when you go all in on a couple 
I usually buy individual net nets when the market has plenty of offerings  but even then  I m not willing to put more than 5  into a net net position 
The Real Outperformer of 2015
Now if you exclude the NCAV and NNWC from the performance list  that only leaves the  outperforming the market 
For the Altman Z screen  I ignore financials  utilities and mining 
Here s another look at the Q1 and Q2 side by side 

The Altman Z Stocks as of June 30  2015
Here are the 20 stocks that make up the Altman Z screen for 2015 sorted by performance  Click to enlarge the image 

The biggest loser is DeVry  NYSE DV  and it s not a surprise considering that the entire for profit industry has been smashed 
Looking back at when I held Strayer  NASDAQ STRA  last year  I m lucky to have gotten out with a 40  gain as the industry is just horrific  You have to be on the edge of your seat with the for profit sector as anything can happen at any time 
Another stock that I m glad to see in green which I currently hold is Cal Maine Foods  NASDAQ CALM  
This isn t a typical value play 
Most of the value is being derived from the increase in egg prices due to an outbreak of bird flu which I heard about at the beginning of the year 
This is more of a supply and demand scenario  and this was definitely luck on my part  I m not a huge commodity stock investor because of the constant need to monitor the market  egg prices  demand  affects on supply chain  what customers are willing to pay  trend in consumer eating habits and so on 
And I m not a fan of trying to time the commodity cycle  but I ll take it here

11973,233488,ATGE,5 Stocks To Buy In DeVos  For Profit Education Regime,opinion,For profit education stocks have received a strong lift from the Trump wave that has boosted the broader market  Sector leaders Adtalem Global Education Inc    NYSE ATGE   formerly known as DeVry  Grand Canyon Education  Inc    NASDAQ LOPE   and Strayer Education  Inc    NASDAQ STRA   have each outperformed the S P 500 since Trump s election President Donald Trump s appointment of Betsy DeVos as the Secretary of Education was a big reason for choosing to invest in for profit education stocks  She is widely considered the most business friendly person to hold the position since the Department of Education was created by Jimmy Carter in 1979 Will 2018 Shower Fortunes on For Profit Colleges The Trump administration is set to revise for profit education industry regulations  as announced by the U S  Department of Education last year  The department intends to bring about changes to the Borrower Defense to Repayment  BDR  and Gainful Employment  GE  system  introduced during Obama s reign DeVos seemed to have responded according to investors  plans  She has delayed the implementation of gainful employment rules  withdrawn key federal student loan servicing reforms  and signaled a less arduous regulatory environment for the industry  A gainful employment rule is aimed at ensuring that a program offered by an educational institution leads to  gainful employment in a recognized occupation   If the loan repayment amount is more than a certain percentage of the students  income  the program will not be eligible for federal aid  She withdrew important federal student loan servicing reforms that make it easier for college students to have loans discharged when they ve been defrauded by schools Meanwhile  DeVos recently made it clear that her top priority is expanding alternatives to traditional public schools  She defends her decision to relax a number of Obama policies in an effort to keep for profit schools an option for non traditional students  However  many industry pandits claim that it will trap students with false promises  burdens them with debt and finally leave them without any skills required to secure decent jobs Among other provisions drafted by the Trump administration  the House s recent draft bill proposes to undo the  90 10  rule introduced by the Obama administration  which requires for profit institutions to earn at least 10  of their revenues from sources other than federal financial aid  If graduates fail to find employment enough to pay back their student debt  colleges can still profit on loans backed by the federal government  The Obama era Department of Education required for profits to show enough employment numbers to remain eligible for federal aid For profit education companies are poised to surge given the friendly approach of the Trump administration toward these companies Encouraging Programs to Drive EnrollmentApart from the much needed regulatory support  industry giants are finding innovative ways to compete in an increasingly competitive education landscape and deliver returns to shareholders  In order to boost growth  school companies have resorted to aggressive cost cutting measures through significant layoffs and campus closings For profit education companies are investing in digital capabilities and stepping up social media efforts to increase their brand value as well as boost enrolment growth  The for profits are also forging corporate and community college partnerships to educate their workforce  Additionally  companies are improving their technology and infrastructure  increasing investments to improve the academic quality and retain students  buying complementary businesses  and regularly introducing new programs and specializations to boost student outcomes Investors are also taking notice of the positive changes in the industry and for profit school stocks are getting a strong boost under Trump s presidency and DeVos  control  The  has rallied 28 3  in the past year  outperforming the S P 500 s gain of 10 5   The industry has every reason to celebrate as it appears

SAO PAULO  Reuters    For profit school chain Adtalem Global Education Inc  N ATGE  has put its assets in Brazil up for sale  including flagship university Ibmec  four sources with knowledge of the matter said 
Adtalem s Brazilian assets are likely to fetch at least 2 billion reais   505 million   two of the sources said  Adtalem Global Education has a 97 9  stake in Adtalem Brazil 
The company runs 15 schools in Brazil under three brands  with nearly 82 000 students  Wyden Educational  Ibmec and Damasio 
The education company s Brazilian operation posted revenue of  50 million in the first quarter  down 15 5  from a year before  mainly due to a decrease in value of the Brazilian currency  Still  new student enrollment increased 17 7   mainly driven by demand for online courses and business oriented school Ibmec 
In its first quarter results  Adtalem said in a filing that the Brazilian economy  presented challenges for enrollment growth and created pricing pressures in the education sector   It offered discounts for students to compensate for delays and cuts in a federal student loan fund known as Fies 
Adtalem is in talks with  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  to hire its investment banking unit as an adviser on the deal  the sources added  Neither Adtalem nor Morgan Stanley replied immediately to requests for comment 
Some of the sources said Adtalem would attract more interest from buyers if it broke up its Brazilian operations  as the three businesses are very different  But two of the people said Adtalem intends to sell its Brazilian units in a single block
