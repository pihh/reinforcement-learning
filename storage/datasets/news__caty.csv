I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer  Mr  Pin Tai 
Pin Tai    Director and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you  Georgia  and good afternoon  Welcome to our 2019 fourth quarter earnings conference call  This afternoon  we reported net income of  67 4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019  a 4 3  increase when compared to net income of  64 6 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 
Diluted earnings per share increased by 5  to  0 84 for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared to  0 80 per share for the same quarter a year ago  In the fourth quarter of 2019  our gross loans grew by  346 9 million to  15 1 billion or an increase of 9 9  on an annualized basis  The increase in loans for the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by the growth in commercial real estate loans of  139 7 million or 8 3  annualized  commercial loans of  110 7 million or 16 9  annualized and residential mortgage loans of  77 8 million or 8 4  annualized  We anticipate loan growth in 2020 of between 6  to 7  
For the fourth quarter of 2019  our total deposits grew slightly by  34 million or 1  annualized to  14 7 billion  During the fourth quarter of 2019  money market deposits grew by  165 4 million or 32 6  annualized  NOW deposits grew by  75 9 million or 22  annualized  While time deposits decreased by  176 2 million with respect to the now partially resolved trade dispute between the US and China  we continue to monitor and evaluate this potential impact of the comparing tariff to our loan portfolio  Borrowers that we believe could be adversely impacted by the current tariffs hold approximately 2  of our total loans 
With that  I ll turn the floor over to our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Heng Chen  to discuss the fourth quarter 2019 financials in more detail 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you  Pin  and good afternoon  everyone  For the fourth quarter  we announced net income of  67 4 million or  0 84 diluted earnings per share  Our net interest margin was 3 34  in the fourth quarter of 2019  as compared to 3 77  in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 3 56  for the third quarter of 2019 
Excess liquidity during the fourth quarter reduced the NIM by 2 basis points  In the fourth quarter of 2019 interest recoveries and prepayment penalties added 4 basis points to the net interest margin  compared to 3 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 12 basis points for the third quarter of 2019  We expect our net interest margin for 2020 to be between 3 35  and 3 45  
Non interest income during the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased by  2 1 million to  8 7 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  This decrease was primarily due to a  4 million decrease in net gains from equity securities and partially offset by a  1 3 million increase in wealth management fees 
Non interest expense decreased by  3 2 million or 4 3  to  71 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 when compared to  74 4 million in the same quarter a year ago  This decrease was primarily due to a  5 7 million decrease in the amortization of the investments in low income housing and alternative energy partnerships  partially offset by a  1 2 million increase in FDIC and State assessments 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 19 5  and 20 1  for the full year of 2019  The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 is expected to be approximately 20  with the full year 2020 effective tax rate to be between 18  to 18 5  assuming the closing of another solar tax credit investment in the second quarter of 2020 
Solar tax credits amortization was  6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and  17 4 million for the full year of 2019  Solar tax credit amortization is expected to be approximately  24 million in 2020  including a  10 million of amortization from the proposed new investment  which we expect to close in the second quarter  The amortization expense is expected to be  8 million in the first quarter of 2020  then  5 3 million in the last    in each of the last three quarters of 2020 
At December 31  2019  our Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 10 83   the same as at December 31  Phonetic  2018  Our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio increased to 12 51  from 12 43  at December 31  2018  and our total risk based capital ratio decreased to 14 11  from 14 15  at December 31  2018 
Net recoveries for the fourth quarter of 2019 were  2 3 million  compared to net recoveries of  5 3 million in the third quarter of 2019 and net charge offs of  1 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018  There was a loan loss reversal of  5 million for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared to a loan loss reversal of  2 million in the third quarter of 2019 and no loan loss provision or reversal in the fourth quarter of 2018 
Our non accrual loans decreased by  6 7 million to  40 5 million  or 0 27  of period end loans as compared to the end of the third quarter of 2019 
Pin  please continue 
Pin Tai    Director and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you  Heng  We will now proceed to the question and answer portion of the call 
Questions and Answers 
Operator
 Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from Chris McGratty of KBW  Your line is open 
Chris McGratty    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods  Inc     Analyst
Great  Thanks for the question  Heng  I m interested in the assumptions behind the 2020 margin of 3 35  to 3 45   especially related to where we re starting in Q4  Could you provide kind of your interest rate assumptions  and whether this will be primarily a function of drop in the deposit cost further or maybe the factors that go into that  Thanks 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  Chris  we are assuming no further    no changes in the prime rate in 2020  And I think the biggest factor for the    for our guidance is that  in the first quarter we have  2 6 billion of relatively higher cost at CDs  the cost is    the average cost of these maturing CDs is 2 2  and we expect to renew them at no higher than 1 8   And these represent roughly 34  of our total CD portfolio  And this first quarter renewal should by itself add 8 basis points or improve the NIM by 8 basis points 
And then secondarily  I mentioned in my remarks that we had 2 basis points of excess liquidity  So  offsetting by all that would be some loss of rate as loans mature from our existing portfolio 
Chris McGratty    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods  Inc     Analyst
Okay  great  Thanks for that  And then  maybe a question on provisioning  given the implementation of CECL  in light of your 6  to 7  loan growth  how do you view the provision expense for 2020 given the change in accounting and given the pipeline of recoveries 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well  we think we are not quite  we are still working on CECL  we ve had 1 5 of dry runs  we re    and we re learning about that  I think we have not given guidance on the day one adjustment which would be for a moderate increase in the all  but we think in terms of provisioning that it would be just a little bit less than 1  of net loan growth  And that s in terms of our thinking on that 6  to 7  loan growth  a portion of that is residential mortgage  So that would be reserved at a lower rate than the rest of our loan portfolio 
And then lastly  we had recoveries for several quarters to show  Under CECL  we have to or companies have to book an asset for any probable recoveries of loans that were charged off before December 31  2019  But based on our pending litigation    collection litigation outlook  we think we have a couple of prospects for C I recoveries in 2020  So    and then  credit wise right now  it looks pretty benign to us  So that s sort of our outlook  We re not going to give more detailed guidance that that  because nobody    the crystal ball is never perfect 
Chris McGratty    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods  Inc     Analyst
That s helpful  Thanks  And just one more and I ll step back  The low income housing tax credits  could you provide what that might be in 2020 as well 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
The amortization should be slightly or about the same as in 2019  That would be about  5 5 million a quarter 
Chris McGratty    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods  Inc     Analyst
Great  Thank you 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thank you  Your next question comes from Aaron Deer of Piper Sandler and Company  Your line is open 
Aaron Deer    Piper Sandler and Company    Analyst
Hey  good afternoon  everyone 
Pin Tai    Director and Chief Executive Officer
Hi  Aaron 
Aaron Deer    Piper Sandler and Company    Analyst
I m just curious with Phase 1 of the trade deal now complete  I d like to get your thoughts on what that means prospectively for you and your clients  And what that might mean for the loan mix heading into 2020  It seems like you had pretty strong growth in commercial real estate and C I heading into year end  I m just wondering  if    how that might be part of the mix relative to single family in 2020 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  Well  Aaron  let me start and Pin can give the more macro guidance  In terms of looking at 2020  we think our residential mortgage growth will be slower than in the past because our mortgage book is so high  And then you might not have caught it  but the group of loans were impact    that might be impacted by the tariffs  that had dropped to 2  of our total loan portfolio  So    and then  I think lastly in terms of the Q4 loan growth  there wasn t that much and seasonally it s a slow quarter for trade finance 
Pin  you want to talk about 2020  the outlook 
Pin Tai    Director and Chief Executive Officer
The outlook for 2018  Phonetic  look better than 2019  Indecipherable  completed the signing of the first round of season  However  the second one will be starting  I think probably at December  August or September  In total customer  Indecipherable  they get handled as long as there is no additional tariff increase  So we are seeing actually a small reduction in the impact to our total loan portfolio and the customers impacted by the tariff 
Aaron Deer    Piper Sandler and Company    Analyst
Okay  And then  how about any thoughts on capital deployment  I guess specifically on share repurchases and how you guys are thinking about that at this point 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
We bought    I would say a fair amount  I think over 1 million shares in 2019  Most of it was in the first half  And we didn t buyback any shares in the fourth quarter  mainly due to the relative price of our stock  It s certainly something we will look at in 2020  particularly now that we know the impact from CECL and its being relatively modest for us  And so  it s an item in our capital toolkit  but it ll depend on    basically on the stock price 
Aaron Deer    Piper Sandler and Company    Analyst
Okay  great  Thanks for taking my questions 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  Thank you  Aaron 
Operator
Thank you  Your next question comes from Lana Chan of BMO Capital Markets  Your question please 
Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst
Thanks  Good afternoon 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi  Lana 
Pin Tai    Director and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Lana 
Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst
I was wondering given the strong loan growth at year end  your loan to deposit ratio increased to 103   What are the expectations for deposit growth in 2020 versus your 67  loan growth  And the reason why I m asking is  I m just wondering how aggressive you can be with lowering deposit cost  given the loan to deposit ratio 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  I think on the loan to deposit ratio we had a couple of large outflows on the last two days of the year  but in the fourth quarter as a whole we had pretty  pretty strong core deposit growth 
In terms of 2020  the biggest challenge for us is getting more core deposits  So  as far as our Chinese New Year promotions  that s a six week sort of promotional period where we don t have a set rate as we did in the past  but the results from the first couple of days have been pretty good in that  We are lowering the rate from 2 20   actually the rate in that promotion was higher than    I think close to 2 35  and our current target rate is 1 65  to 1 70   But we actually had a net increase in CDs for the first two days of this renewal cycle 
And then lastly  we think we ll have good momentum in getting money market  we will continue to have momentum getting money market deposits as    which are lower rate than CDs on average  because of the stabilization of the rate picture and then we have    we hired a new Cash Manager last summer and we believe that we ll be able to execute better on getting business deposits 
So I think we    it s a start of the New Year  we feel pretty good right now  And based on the results for the first this weeks  core deposit growth is decent 
Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst
Okay  Thank you  Heng  And then  could you  I guess  talk about expectations for core expense growth this year 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  We finished with our budget  Our 2020 budget was approved last week or a few    maybe a week and a half ago  And we think the increase on that excluding solar amortization  which is going to be higher because we re investing a little bit more in 2020  we think that overall the expenses    core expenses would be flat to maybe up by 1   In terms of places  we got pretty good savings from telecommunications  that s in 2020  We like most other banks were pretty tough on how we expect 2020 incentive bonuses to be  So we re budgeting for a lower amount and we also cut back on discretionary items such as marketing and things like that  So we re going to try real hard to maintain a neutral operating leverage 
Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst
Got it  Thank you  And just one last question  if I could  If I look at your average securities  you talked about the elevated excess liquidity in the quarter  your average securities were  1 56 billion which was much higher than the end of period balance  Should that  1 56 billion come back down in the first quarter 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  I think probably  maybe closer to  1 45 billion or something like that  We    because of our excess security    liquidity  we had  100 million    roughly  100 million in three months treasuries rather than keep it all at the Fed 
Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst
Okay  great  Thank you very much 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure 
Operator
Thank you  Our next question comes from Gary Tenner of D A  Davidson  Please go ahead 
Gary Tenner    D A  Davidson    Analyst
Thanks  Good afternoon  My questions were partially answered  but just wanted to follow up on the CD repricing  you talked about for the first quarter  I would think that the second quarter of the year might also have a decent delta in terms of the maturing rate versus the renewal rates  I m wondering if you could detail any further into the year on CD repricing 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  It s quite a bit less  the average rate is 1 93   so    and there s only  1 2 million of CDs repricing  so that s going to contribute very little  The third quarter the rate is 1 85  and there is only  1 5 billion of CDs maturing  And in the fourth quarter that s where we renewed  in the fourth quarter this year the average rate is already down to 1 72  and there s only  1 2 billion  So most of it is going to be in the first quarter and hopefully while we have the first quarter conference call  I ll be able to give a favorable report on our NIM 
Gary Tenner    D A  Davidson    Analyst
Okay  perfect  Thank you 
Operator
Thank you   Operator Instructions  The next question comes from David Chiaverini of Wedbush Securities  Your line is open 
David Chiaverini    Wedbush Securities    Analyst
Hi  thanks  A couple of questions for you  So first on the money market deposit rate  it looks like it actually went up from the September quarter to the December quarter from 1 11  to 1 19   I was curious as to why that increased 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
We put a bigger emphasis on attracting those and so for larger depositors that have multiple millions  we would pay a higher rate  And then second  in the middle of the fourth quarter we did start accepting wholesale money markets  And those are basically in a 1 8  range  And in 2020  we ll also be using those as alternative to broker CDs 
David Chiaverini    Wedbush Securities    Analyst
Got it  And you ve incorporated  I m assuming that into your guidance  the expected growth in your money market at the higher rate into that 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  And then we    in December we repriced our exceptional money market relationship  money market deposits downward by  I think  on average 20 basis points  So and then we ll look at that at least once a quarter to make sure we re not paying above the market for a large relationship money market balances 
David Chiaverini    Wedbush Securities    Analyst
Great  That makes sense  And then shifting over to credit quality  I saw that accruing loans past due 90 days increased about  6 million  what was the driver behind that 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
It was one loan  which we    it s cash secured we had and we expect that to be paid off in a couple of weeks  There was some difficulties in  I guess  contacting the borrower who I understand was    might have been out of the country  but    so there s no credit issue with that particular loan 
David Chiaverini    Wedbush Securities    Analyst
Great  And then the last one for me  So the easing  you mentioned about how the easing of    about the easing of the tariffs and how it led to net recoveries of  2 5 million in the fourth quarter 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No  those are unrelated  Excuse me  We were talking about the provisioning as some of the negative loan loss provision was related to the easing  But sorry  go ahead 
David Chiaverini    Wedbush Securities    Analyst
Well  I guess to just finish that thought  would you expect  as this easing in Phase 1 is done and to the extent that we get additional progress or is there    are there any loans that you could possibly see additional recoveries on related to the trade war easing 
Heng W  Chen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
We have a general    we have a general reserve for the trade war  So to the extent there    and it s not a huge number  but to the extent there was further progress in 2020  we could reduce that general reserve and that reserve would carry over under CECL 
David Chiaverini    Wedbush Securities    Analyst

107466,328981,CATY,Goldman Sachs  GS  Expands Consumer Banking Business,opinion,The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    NYSE GS    widely focused on large companies and wealthy clients  is expanding its offerings to general consumers through its new retail banking service In April  complementing its funding capabilities  Goldman s subsidiary   Goldman Sachs Bank USA  GS Bank    completed the acquisition of the online deposit platform of GE Capital Bank   According to a recent report by the Associated Press  GS Bank has added  1 billion in new deposits  Also  the Wall Street giant s unit intends to expand its offerings with personal loans shortly Currently  GS bank s online deposit platform allows customers to open savings accounts and invest in certificates of deposits  Notably  the company is offering competitive rates for online savings accounts which stand above 1  where as several others pay less The report quoted Stephen Scherr  CEO of GS Bank  saying   We see an opportunity to serve a different customer set than we typically have served   adding   And we do it at a time when there is a lot of change in how banking is done with and for consumers  Scherr also stated that the company sees itself as a competitor to traditional consumer banks as well as online startups  The unit enjoys competitive advantage due to the name recognition and business expertise of an established financial brand  unlike other startups Following the 2008 financial crisis  investment banks like Goldman are pushed to operate more like universal banks  Notably  Goldman has been undertaking efforts to boost the business of GS Bank as stringent regulations  higher capital requirements and volatile markets have posed revenue challenges The online lending business that is posing a threat to the traditional banking business is rapidly growing with a number of online lenders  Though by joining the online lending bandwagon Goldman faces risks including stiff competition  we believe the financial bigwig will certainly come up with a strategy to gain a strong foothold in its new venture Currently  Goldman carries a Zack Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the finance space include LPL Financial Holdings Inc    NASDAQ LPLA    Cathay General Bancorp   NASDAQ CATY   and First Bancorp   NYSE FBP    each sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ,2016-06-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/goldman-sachs-(gs)-expands-consumer-banking-business-200135961,200135961
107469,328984,CATY,Will PNC Financial Continue To Face Revenue Pressure ,opinion,"On Jun 15  2016  we issued an updated research report on The PNC Financial Services Group  Inc    NYSE PNC    Notably  shares of this Pennsylvania based banking giant have lost more than 11 6  year to date 
PNC Financial s revenues have been under pressure amid an overall challenging environment  Over the past several years  the company has experienced declining net interest margin  NIM  and muted growth in net interest income  NII  due to a persistent low interest rate scenario  The December rate hike was not enough to result in a significant boost  Notably  during the first quarter 2016  though NII grew 1  on a year over year basis  NIM declined 7  
Further  despite having a diversified fee income base  the company failed to achieve a stable growth pattern in non interest income over the past few years  Notably  non interest income dropped 6  year over year during the first quarter 2016 mainly due to the  weaker equity markets and lower capital markets activity PNC FINL SVC CP Price   Significant improvement in top line growth is likely to remain elusive in the near term as management s guidance calls for only a modest increase in revenues for the year 
Further  it should be noted that management s forecast considered two rate hikes this year   one in June and the other in December  However  as the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark short term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday at the end of the two day policy meeting  banks like PNC Financial will continue to have a tough time ahead 
Among other issues  volatility in oil prices has affected the asset quality of the bank  given its exposure in the energy sector  High provisions to cover the soured loans of the energy companies continue to dent its financials  Notably  during the first quarter 2016  provision for credit losses was  152 million  significantly up from  54 million in the prior year quarter  mainly tied with energy related loans

107471,328986,CATY,Is It Wise To Consider Cathay General  CATY  A Great Value Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cathay General Bancorp   NASDAQ CATY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cathay General has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 81  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 204  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Cathay General s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Banks West industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 05  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Cathay General has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 27  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Cathay General stock in the near term too P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Cathay General s P CF ratio of 13 71 is higher than the Zacks classified Banks Westindustry average of 15 96  which indicates that the stock is somewhat overvalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cathay General currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cathay General a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Cathay General might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives CATY a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  D    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty discouraging  Although neither the current quarter  nor the full year estimate has seen any revision  both of them have declined by 1 6  in the past two months  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cathay General Bancorp Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCathay General is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 25  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Banks West industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  8 Companies Verge on Cathay General Like RunDid you miss Cathay General s 9X stock explosion after they

107495,329010,CATY,Mid Cap Dividend Growth Stocks By Sector  Regional Banks ,opinion,"Introduction
In part 1 of this series on fairly valued mid cap investment opportunities I primarily focused on non dividend paying growth oriented mid caps  In part 2 of this series I turned my focus to finding fairly valued dividend paying mid caps  However  as I was evaluating dividend paying mid caps in the S P Midcap 400 mid cap index  it became clear to me that the differences between dividend paying mid caps were more important than the similarities  Therefore  I have grouped the dividend paying mid caps I found into 3 separate offerings focusing on sectors  In this  part 2A  I will be exclusively covering fairly valued mid sized regional banks 
However  I feel it s important to note that although there are several regional banks in the S P 400 mid cap index  I only found four dividend paying regional banks of reasonable quality that I considered attractively valued at this time  There were others that appeared reasonably valued  but they were excluded primarily because they were apparently willing participants in the financial debacle that many believe led to the Great Recession of 2008  Nevertheless  two of the four research candidates I present below did suffer stress during the financial crisis  however  their post crisis recoveries have been stronger than those I excluded 
4 Fairly Valued Regional Banks
The following portfolio review summarizes the four mid cap dividend paying regional banks  Cullen Frost  NYSE CFR   Cathay General Bancorp  NASDAQ CATY   East West Bancorp  NASDAQ EWBC  and Bank of the Ozarks  NASDAQ OZRK   The portfolio review lists them by ticker  name  credit rating  sector  exchange  P E ratio  dividend yield and market cap 

Note  S P Capital IQ does not report debt to capital on banks  Therefore  ignore the debt to capital number shown in the FAST FACTS boxes to the right of the graphs 
Since many readers may not be familiar with each of these small cap selections  I offer the following overview of each of the 4 research candidates  Courtesy of S P Capital IQ  I included a short business description on each  Additionally  I have provided earnings and price correlated historical F A S T  Graphs  on each with a calculated return forecast out to 2017 based on what I considered the most appropriate valuation reference line 
Note  I have moved the return calculation pop up to the left corner of the graph so that it did not cover up important data listed in the FAST FACTS 
F A S T  Graphs  Tutorial 
In order for the reader to get the maximum benefit from the following presentation  I offer a short tutorial illustrating the various components presented in a F A S T  Graphs   To accomplish this  I will present each component of the graph separately as I rebuild an entire graph  I have chosen Cullen Frost Bankers  Inc  as my tutorial example because it will be the first research candidate I will eventually present 
My first screenshot reflects a plotting of earnings per share  The green shaded area represents a mountain chart of the company s earnings over the timeframe drawn  The orange valuation reference line contains two important aspects  The first aspect is a multiple of earnings  P E ratio  that is listed in the orange colored rectangle in the FAST FACTS to the right of the graph  In this example  the orange line represents a P E ratio of 15  In other words  any time the stock price touches the orange line anywhere on the graph in this example  it will be trading at a P E ratio of 15 
The second aspect of the orange line is the slope which is equal to the earnings growth rate  In this example  the orange line is increasing at the earnings growth rate  the green rectangle in the FAST FACTS  of 6 8   Although there is some cyclicality with earnings in between  this growth rate is calculated as the annualized growth from the first year s earnings per share to the last year on the graph 

With my second screenshot I overlay monthly closing stock prices  This illustrates how stock prices move in conjunction with earnings over the long run  Moreover  periods of overvaluation  when price is above the orange line   fair valuation  when price is touching the orange line  and undervaluation  when price is below the orange line  is clearly revealed  Most importantly  since stock price tracks earnings  it is clear that the company s earnings achievement is what drives the capital appreciation component of total return 

This next screenshot adds a second valuation reference line  the dark blue line  which is a calculated normal P E ratio for the timeframe drawn  In this example  the normal P E ratio line represents a multiple of 16 4  With both of these valuation reference lines on the graph  a clear perspective of a range of valuation is revealed for analysis 

This next screenshot adds a plotting of the company s dividends per share prior to being paid out of earnings  The area below the light green line  it appears white to many people  represents the portion of earnings paid out to shareholders  Therefore  the company s dividend payout ratio  POR  is graphically presented for instant reference 

This next screenshot presents a second dividend reference  The light green shaded area above the orange line indicates the same dividends seen above after they have been paid out to shareholders  This light green shaded area  dividends paid  represents the dividend income component of total return 

The complete  illustrates the earnings and price relationship  offers two valuation reference lines and graphically presents the company s dividend payout ratio and dividends after they are paid out to shareholders  Most importantly  a perspective of the company s current valuation relative to fundamentals is clearly illustrated

Investment Thesis
I chose to present Cullen Frost Bankers  Inc  for a couple of important reasons  First and foremost  I was attracted to the consistent historical earnings growth and steadily rising dividend  Although earnings weakened during the Great Recession  this regional bank performed extremely well on an operating basis in comparison to most of its peers  In other words  this regional bank avoided participating in most of the toxic behavior seen with most banks big and large 
I was also attracted to the company s high current yield and its current low valuation  Consequently  I see the combination of future P E ratio expansion coupled with earnings and dividend growth in the range of 5  to 6  a compelling opportunity  as depicted in the performance calculation  Additionally  Cullen Frost Bankers  Inc  s A  credit rating is also a plus

Investment Thesis
I included Cathay General Bancorp primarily because of its strong recovery since the Great Recession  Clearly  this regional bank did get caught up in the financial crisis  However  their subsequent recovery has been stronger than most of their peers  Hopefully  this regional bank learned a valuable lesson from the financial crisis  Current valuation is attractive  and I like the dividend yield in conjunction with an increasing payout ratio

Investment Thesis
I also included East West Bancorp  Inc  primarily because of its strong recovery since the Great Recession  Clearly  this regional bank did get caught up in the financial crisis  However  their subsequent recovery has been stronger than most of their peers  Hopefully  this regional bank also learned a valuable lesson from the financial crisis  Current valuation is compelling  and I also like the dividend yield in conjunction with an increasing payout ratio  Above average forecast earnings growth coupled with the potential for P E ratio expansion could lead to substantial total returns

Bank of the Ozarks  Inc  was founded in 1981 and is headquartered in Little Rock  Arkansas  
Investment Thesis
I offer Bank of the Ozarks  Inc  as a growth story with a dividend kicker  Although I consider this regional bank fairly valued to even fully valued  I like the company s historical operating record and growth potential going forward  Although the dividend yield is modest at approximately 1 5   its record of dividend growth has been significantly above average  Therefore  I offer Bank of the Ozarks  Inc  as primarily a total return opportunity with modest current dividend income 

Summary and Conclusions
The four mid cap dividend growth stock research candidates featured in this article illustrate the differences that exist between individual companies  Two of these candidates represented examples of regional banks that avoided the worst of the financial crisis  Interestingly  one of them offered the highest yield with moderate growth  while the other had the lowest current yield with the highest growth potential  This speaks to the importance of selecting stocks that meet the individual investor s unique and specific goals and objectives 
The other two companies were exposed to the ravages of the financial crisis and their operating results suffered consistent with most huge money center banks  However  they were included because their recoveries were swift and strong and hopefully because they learned their lessons  Nevertheless  the reader should be aware of what happened to these two companies during the financial crisis 
Furthermore  investors most often associate small and mid cap companies as growth stocks  However  just as it is with larger companies  there are many different types of mid cap stocks that investors can utilize in their portfolios  In part 2B I will present additional fairly valued mid cap dividend growth stocks in the consumer discretionary sector
