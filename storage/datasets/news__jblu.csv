Robin Hayes    Chief Executive Officer
Thanks  Dave  Good morning  and thank you for joining us everyone  I ll start with my thanks to our amazing team of almost 23 000 crew members  Next month  we will celebrate our 20th birthday and I could not be prouder of the accomplishments of the JetBlue family over two decades  Our spirit of teamwork and founding values continue to shine  I mean 2019 alone we received 24 domestic and international awards  These include recognition from JB Power and TripAdvisor to name just two  None of this would be possible without our crew members who deliver our mission to inspire humanity in everything they do 
Over 20 years  we have become force for good in our industry  serving customers in some of the most important markets across the United States  the Caribbean and Latin America  we have worked hard to improve our balance sheet  expand and strengthen our network and have made investments in our fleet to improve margins and returns  More recently  we focused our efforts to reset our cost structure and return to our roots as a low cost airlines  Our low cost structure enabled us to continue to offer a differentiated product and service and low fares to our customers 
Since our inception as an airline that JetBlue model has had a positive and lasting impact on the US airline industry raising the bar for improving service  while also benefiting customers with lower fares  In 2018    2019 I m sorry  we took further strides toward making JetBlue  a better and stronger airline  and in bringing this year to a close  I d like to highlight just a few of the accomplishments of our team  We beat the midpoint of our 2019 initial cost guidance and completed our structural cost program exceeding the original goal we established back in 2016  We rolled out Fare Options 2 0  the next iteration of fare bundling  We made significant progress in the cabin restyling program  which is improving both customer satisfaction and returns  We took delivery of our first six A321neo added our longest route ever and we are looking forward to taking our first A220 by the year end 
We strengthened our focus cities and made some difficult  but important changes to our network to add relevance to our leisure and business customers  We ramped up JetBlue Travel Products laying the groundwork for the next period of growth  We added two new members to our Board of Directors  and I would like to take the opportunity to welcome Vivek Sharma  who brings an extensive background in technology and digital leadership  We continue to invest in our most valuable asset  our crew members  I am proud that our crew members have earned a total of 250 college degrees through our JetBlue Scholars higher education program since launching in 2016  Last year  we also announced that we are expanding the program to include master s degrees 
Lastly  we continue to protect our culture as we grow and we are working on expanding JetBlue s University campus in Orlando and have some very exciting 20th anniversary celebrations planned  We remain committed to the touches    the touches that made us special for 20 years including our industry leading crew members stock purchase plan  our community connection program and our peer to peer recognition programs  In 2019  our crew members reached an incredible milestone volunteering 1 million hours of service over the past eight years  Our crew members have given their time to help communities recovering the natural disasters and encourage STEM education through the JetBlue foundation  Our crew members champion the causes they care about by volunteering with organizations  they are passionate about 
All of these accomplishments contribute to the building blocks as we look to deliver  2 50 to  3 00 earnings per share this year  Our progress towards our 2020 goal has not been without hard work  I m humbled with how our crew members have risen to meet each obstacle we ve accounted    we ve encountered along the way  Just to mention a few examples  we successfully overcame the pressure from lower capacity headwinds on our unit costs and cycled through our first pilot deal offset revenue challenges and still delivered on our 2019 cost goal 
I m pleased to say that as a small thank you  we will be paying a  500 bonus to each crew member in recognition of their efforts towards meeting these important goals  and that expense is included in our fourth quarter results  2019 saw some unexpected revenue headwinds  particularly with an unusually volatile year in our Latin and Caribbean markets  I want to pause for a moment  On behalf of our crew members and leadership team  our thoughts are with all of those impacted by the recent Puerto Rico earthquakes  including some of our crew members  customers and their families  For the past three years  we ve seen the hardship that followed Hurricane Maria I d would like to thank those in our operation and support centers for volunteering your time helping in the relief efforts 
As we have done in the past  we are working closely with the authorities and community to support short term needs and help in the recovery  Following a natural disaster  it is common to see a lingering demand impact even in nearby    even in nearby areas that were not damaged  History suggests that bookings will normalize  but we expect a RASM impact in the first quarter  While events such as this    while events such as this one have masked some of the progress we have made in our building blocks  we are confident in our plan to grow our revenues  We expect over two thirds of our revenue initiatives to mature throughout the year and that progress is reflected in a significant sequential improvement in RASM growth in our first quarter guidance  We are mindful that this year  we anticipate that    we are mindful that this year we anticipate facing heightened competition in both Boston and our Florida markets  But  we believe Fare Options 2 0 will be a key contributor to support our RASM growth and a tool to compete more effectively 
We again anticipate double digit growth in ancillary revenue per customer as our loyalty program continues to mature and we expect to make some exciting announcements related to our travel products subsidiary in the near future  The continuing progress we ve made in our cost base is the best evidence of our determination to deliver improved    improved results in our building growth  This year we expect to deliver negative CASM  ex fuel growth and we will execute the final year of our Phonetic  91  cargo growth commitment 
We expect to deliver on our cost goals in 2020 once again  even with the meaningful NEO delays and our order book  I can t emphasize enough how challenging the delays have been to our crew members and customers during the past year  Our teams have been outstanding in adjusting plans and finding solutions to offset most of the negative impact from lower capacity  We have put together a contingency plan to further protect our cost achievement from potential additional delays  including an agreement for used aircraft 
With regards to the trade dispute between the US and the European Union  we are working to address the impact for the 10  tariff imposed by the US government  our new aircraft delivered from Airbus facilities in France and Germany  JetBlue has filed comments with the US Trade Representative noting the tariff and any increase or expansion of the scope of the goods covered by the time will negatively affect aircraft deliveries to the detriment of JetBlue  the airline industry and customers  JetBlue supports a fair international trading structure  but believe that tariffs would ultimately impact our ability to grow our business  lead to higher fares for customers and drive less competition  We ve urged the US government to reach a fair trade deal with the EU  Protecting our business requires us to act on climate change  I mean you re both the financially successful and more sustainable business 
We are the first major US airline to announce carbon neutral domestic flights  we have also procured sustainable aviation fuel for flight out of San Francisco  giving us early access to this lower carbon fuel and we believe position us    positioning us to move faster on supply in the future  We ve also taken other actions with the long term sustainability and future of our business  We continue to protect both    we continue to protect and diversify our talent pipelines expanding our gateway select pilot program and extending our recruiting efforts with a hiring strategy that honors and supports our veterans  Our JetBlue Foundation also helps create a path  for underrepresented students underrepresented students interested in a career in aviation  Our strategy on these issues is published annually using the SASB and TCFD standards  We are proud to be among the first companies worldwide to disclose using these standards enabling stakeholders to better understand a long term risk and return profile 
Looking into 2020  we are thrilled to see our plan coming together  Despite some temporary headwinds  and then involving    and then evolving competitive environment  our improved operation and enhanced revenue tools are enabling us to compete more effectively in the future  We are pleased with our business is responding to the actions we ve been taking on our network and this year we expect to continue to reaping the benefits of our commercial actions  This gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year target and deliver a pre tax margin above industry average 
Thank you again for our crew members for your passion over the past two decades  Over to you  Joanna 
Joanna Geraghty    President and Chief Operating Officer
Thank you  Robin  First  I d like to also recognize the hard work of our crew members who have delivered a safe and reliable operation this past year 
Turning to slide 6  and our capacity outlook  During the fourth quarter  our capacity grew 6  in the upper half of our guidance range of 4 5  to 6 5   Our full year capacity grew 6 6   also in the upper half of our original growth plan of 5  to 7   This was due to improved completion factor and shifting the timing of our cabin restyling program to make up for NEO delays  We saw improvements in key operating metrics in 2019 
I d like to highlight our improvement in completion factor  We are now among the best in the industry  A special thank you to our tech ops team for their tremendous efforts to strengthen our operation  In 2019  we had almost 70  fewer maintenance related cancellations compared to 2018  These are great accomplishments considering our high aircraft utilization model and the fact that almost three quarters of our operation touches congested airspace more than any other US carrier  Turning to capacity growth  For the first quarter of 2020  we expect our year over year capacity growth between 1 5  and 3 5  with a full year capacity guidance range between 5 5  and 7 5  
Quarterly capacity growth in 2020 reflects our current expectations of Airbus deliveries as well as additional seats from our cabin restyling program  Our forecasted fourth quarter    first quarter growth is unusually low for us and our annual growth is over 2 points lower than our plan from our 2018 Investor Day  By further controlling costs  we ve been able to mitigate  most of the impact from lower capacity  We ve also identified opportunities to mitigate potential additional aircraft delays and recently signed an agreement to lease used A321s which we expect to begin flying later this year  Our capacity guidance for 2020 assumes that only 11 of our 14 contractual NEOs will be delivered by Airbus in 2020  Moving to our network plan  We plan to continue taking targeted capacity actions to both strengthen relevance in our focus cities and adjust to revenue pressures in parts of our network  All of this work continues the reallocation efforts  we started almost a year and a half ago  For our crew members network changes include some difficult decisions to close  not just routes  but also Blue cities  In doing so  we ve been able to focus our growth plan on our focus cities  Some examples include adding relevance to our Boston customers with 15 daily flights to DCA and 10 daily flights to LaGuardia  We now offer the most non stop flights between Metro New York and the LA Basin  This year  we also expect to continue expanding our successful Mint cabin in our transcon markets  We are confident in our network actions and are encouraged by the improving performance of our leisure and VFR international markets  which continue to produce strong margins for JetBlue  We anticipate tactical capacity adjustments will support a quarter over quarter improvement in Latin and Caribbean unit revenues  We are pleased with the performance of our business markets  driven by strong demand trends and we are happy with the progress in our transcon franchise 
Turning to slide 7  and the revenue outlook  Taking a step back  2019 saw some unique challenges in our Latin and Caribbean markets  We made tactical adjustments and are seeing a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter into the first quarter of 2020  In our domestic markets  we are pleased to report that 2019 RASM meaningfully outperformed the industry on a stage adjusted basis  Regarding the fourth quarter  our RASM decreased 2 7  versus last year  in line with our December update range of minus 3 5  to minus 1 5   During the fourth quarter  close in bookings for the Thanksgiving peak were not as strong as we originally expected  By region  our international RASM reflected a sequential improvement from our early capacity actions despite compressed    competitive pressures in some markets 
As expected  we saw a sequential decline in our domestic RASM driven by added capacity  For the first quarter  we expect strong sequential improvement in RASM in both our domestic and Latin markets resulting from our capacity actions  our revenue initiatives  easier comps and lower scheduled growth  Our first quarter guidance of 0  to 3  includes a headwind of approximately 1 5 to our system RASM due to earthquakes in Puerto Rico  We remain committed to the island  but given the most recent booking trends we are temporarily really reducing capacity to protect RASM we would anticipate storing this flying as demand recovers  I d like to thank the various teams across JetBlue  who were involved in executing and delivering Fare Options 2 0  We are pleased with the early performance and are seeing tangible benefits in the first quarter  which we expect will continue to ramp as the year progresses  We are also excited about further progress in our commercial building blocks  These include the maturation of our network reallocation efforts  JetBlue Travel Products and added growth from ancillaries including loyalty  At the end of 2019  our ancillary revenue per customer reached  34 growing 14  year over year  This accomplishment includes another outstanding year of growth in our co brand credit card  We continue to see momentum from customers signing up for the card and earning and using TrueBlue points in our network and with our partners  Ancillary revenue performance was also driven by our efforts to optimize the pricing of checked bags and even more space seats  This year we expect to continue optimizing the pricing of ancillaries and adding initiatives that promote self service such as change and cancel servicing fees  We also plan to make investments in our reservation platform and upgrade our revenue management system  We continue to work in each building block both to protect and to grow our revenue base  When normalized for Easter and Passover holiday shift  we expect that our network in pricing actions to strengthen our markets and it will result in our best quarter over quarter RASM acceleration since 2016  Looking beyond the first quarter  we anticipate that our initiatives will continue to ramp contributing to our earnings progression each quarter  In total  we believe that our revenue building blocks will add approximately 3 points of RASM growth throughout 2020  Again  a huge thank you to our amazing team across JetBlue for delivering a safe and solid operation and for continuing to deliver a great experience to our customers  With that  I will turn the call over to Steve  Thank you  Joanna  I ll start on slide 9  with some highlights from the fourth quarter  Revenue was  2 billion of 3  year over year  Adjusted pre tax margin was 10 9  or 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year  Both GAAP and adjusted earnings per diluted share were  0 56  Our effective tax rate this quarter was 27  and 26  for the full year  Before going into details on our cost execution  I d like to acknowledge the outstanding job of our crew members  We have to succeed our cost saving initiatives in 2019  Despite the number of meaningful headwinds  the efforts of our teams over the past couple of years are helping reset our cost base and we will setup JetBlue to success in 2020 and beyond  This year  we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 23  higher than our peer average  This accomplishment has set us up nicely to deliver even on current consistent    consensus estimates  the best EPS growth in our industry in 2020 significantly outperforming our peer group  Moving to slide 10  CASM ex fuel for the fourth quarter was flat in line with the midpoint of our guidance range  Our reported figure includes a special bonus for our crew members as an acknowledgment of the outstanding efforts in 2019  If we exclude the bonus expense  our underlying CASM ex fuel declined 9 9  year over year beating our guidance  In 2019  CASM ex fuel grew 9 8  beating the midpoint of our initial full year guidance of 0  to 2   Again excluding the bonus  CASM ex fuel grew just 9 5  for the year well ahead of our plan  I could not be prouder of the determination of our crew members and leaders to deliver our cost targets as we return to our low cost routes  For the first quarter of 2020  we expect CASM ex fuel growth to range between 1 5  and 3 5   For perspective  the year over year progression in unit cost this quarter is mainly driven by unusually low scheduled capacity growth given the timing of 2019 deliveries  In addition  we have scheduled maintenance events during the trough period  the results of expenses shifting into the quarter  Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year  our dated 2020 CASM ex fuel guidance is now between minus 2   0   We are pleased that despite the capacity constraints tied to the NEO delays  our 2020 goal is very much in line with the original CASM ex fuel goal  we announced our last Investor Day  Furthermore  our 2020 plan reflects our commitment to deliver on our 3 year CAGR goal of zero to 1   Moving to slide 11  Since 2018  we have communicated  our CASM ex fuel guidance for the first half and second half  In both 2018 and 2019  we are the delivered or have exceeded our guidance even at the timing of expenses shifted within the year  For either perspective  we finished 2019 with one of our best CASM  ex fuel performances in a decade even while site into our first pilot contract  In 2020  we expect to deliver a negative CASM ex fuel having full for the achievements in 2019  The shape of the CASM ex fuel for the first and second half of the year is driven by three factors  First  stretch a cost savings manifesting through the P L  Second the timing of maintenance expense  Finally  our most impactful is simply the cadence of capacity growth throughout 2020  as you work through NEO delays on the cabin restyling program  Moving to slide 12  We are not progress  this will be our last semi annual updates on our structural cost program  We are pleased to report cumulative run rate savings of  314 million above the high end of our  250 million to  300 million target that we set at our 2016 Investor Day  As expected this quarter  we made further progress across the four pillars  writing  Phonetic  from additional improvements in contractual terms with our business partners  technology deployments and efforts to further increase productivity across JetBlue and throughout the report that we are in the final contracting stage that the V2500 SelectOne engines maintenance  Indecipherable   following the NEO and V2500 pre select monthly agreements announced previously  This rounds out our efforts to reshape our long term engine maintenance contracts  which have been instrumental and exceeding our structural cost savings target  Looking forward  structural cost is now a way of life for JetBlue and our work is obviously never done  We expect to continue to offset inflationary pressures on our cost structure  I look forward to the benefits of our NEO and A320 fleet programs as we move into the next decade  Turning to slide 13  We ended the fourth quarter with 259 aircraft taking ownership of our six A321neo in late December  We now anticipate a maximum of 11 NEO deliveries in 2020 and are expecting our first A220 delivery by the year end  We have restyled 53 A320s as of today and to restyle the balance of the fleet by early 2021  We continued to manage our restyling schedule to minimize the impact of lower capacity resulting from timing of aircraft deliveries  Turning to slide 14  Our balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in our industry  and that s a  Indecipherable  ratio sits well within our target range of 34  year end  and we are proud to manage JetBlue to investment grade metrics  During the fourth quarter  we repaid  65 million in debt and issued the public WTC  the  772 million  Our price diversified debt sources is opportunistic and takes full advantage of our strong balance sheet as we reinvest in our business and return excess cash to our owners  In the fourth quarter  we entered into an agreement to repurchase  160 million of shares as part of the current  800 million authorization from the Board  This authorization is part of the capital allocation building blocks discussed on the Investor Day  We closed the year with  1 3 billion in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments equating to 16 4  of trailing 12 month revenue  Our cash position at the end of the quarter is temporarily higher than our 10  to 12  target given the fewer aircraft deliveries in 2019 resulted in some CapEx shifting to 2020  Moving to slide 15  for an overview of our guidance for the quarter in 2020  We expect another outstanding year on cost execution to support margin improvement as we execute our commercial building blocks  As we move toward the annual EPS goal of  253 our guidance for the first quarter ranges between  0 10 and  0 20 in earnings per share  Before we begin the Q A session  I would like to highlight some changes  we ll be making to our guidance process  Starting this quarter  we will no longer file monthly traffic reports  I m sure you ve noticed a reformatted investor update this morning and starting in April  we plan to provide an update ahead of each Earnings Call  As normal course of business  we anticipate providing the market and update on RASM during the quarter  I d like to again thank our crew members for helping create further value for our customers and owners  the future of their hard work and engagement is showing in our cost progression  We believe that keeping our momentum for the last  Indecipherable  continue to drive up our margins and benefit all of JetBlue  We remain absolutely committed to delivering our EPS goals and I look forward to executing what we believe is the best earnings growth story in our industry during 2020  We will now take your questions

Questions and Answers 
Operator
Thank you   Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from Dan Pfennigwerth with Evercore  Your line is now open 
Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore Partners    Analyst
Hey  good morning  Thank you  I wanted to ask you firstly on sort of your revenue forecasting process and how you grade your own execution over the second half of 2019  Can you just let us know how you    how you back test it and to what extent does the revenue forecasting process change based on what you learn along the way 
Joanna Geraghty    President and Chief Operating Officer
Sure  Great  I ll have Dave Clark answer that question for us 
Dave Clark    Vice President of Sales and Revenue Management 
This is Dave  Good morning  thanks for the question  We ve done a lot of work  focusing on our guidance accuracy and part of that s been studying the accuracy back to 2017 versus the rest of the industry  Our analysis showed we re doing quite well versus the industry until the summer of 2019 
Clearly we re not satisfied with the forecast performance over the last six months and we ve been putting significant focus on process improvement including how to account for some of the changes in our network and our mix competitors  We re doing some things like adding additional variables and being more granular where we need to  For example  we re no longer treating every ASM of competitive capacity the same 
Lastly  we re also running in parallel  a new forecast using machine learning  it s not ready for prime time yet  but it s something we re working on  we envision implementing in the future  So it s been a focus and we look forward to improvement 
Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore Partners    Analyst
Thanks  Thanks for that color  And just for my follow up  could you summarize the fee increases or the fee changes that you rolled out in the fourth quarter and how much of this impacted the fourth quarter  In other words when do we hit true run rate on the fee changes you announced  Thanks for taking the question 
Dave Clark    Vice President of Sales and Revenue Management
And just for clarity  we rolled out fee changes last week on optimizing bank fees with self service  as well as a change or cancel service fee  In the fourth quarter  we rolled out Fair Options 2 0  which will ramp significantly during the quarter  We got a little bit of a benefit in the fourth quarter  we ll get a good bit in the first quarter  it s quite a ramp up  But then that will continue to progress throughout the course of this year  If you look at the initiatives as a whole  which might be the most helpful way  we expect 3 points of RASM during the year    the full year and that breaks down to low to mid 2 points in the first half and then mid to high 3 points in the second half of the progression 
Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore Partners    Analyst

Your next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research  Your line is now open 
Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    Analyst
Hey  thanks  The  it looks like three more A321s were pushed out of 2020  Obviously you guys  you know what you know and you give us your best guess based on what you know now  but what is your conviction level  Robin  around actually getting those 11 and if you were to sort of say  hey  it s 50 50 it could go down  I don t know  how would you kind of bracket in the rest of that  And then just to be clear  Are you leasing three used A321s or more and is Airbus paying for that  Thanks 
Robin Hayes    Chief Executive Officer
Good  good morning  Hunter  Thanks for question  I think I    Steve is very close to  so I m going to throw that one over to him 
Steve Priest    Chief Financial Officer
Hi  Hunter  good morning  As you are aware from our materials  the    the Airbus post agreement outlines 14 NEOs for 2020  you re right  We are planning the business on 11th  We have  as you can imagine  an extensive relationship with Airbus and continue to be in close co operation with them to understand their production delays  so that we can go forward and understand that  So as it stands at this point in time  we have confidence in the guide  you know  That can obviously evolve as things go forward  I ll reflect back to 2019  We had exactly the same conversation with Airbus  we anticipated a maximum of six aircraft in 2019 and we got six aircraft in 2019  Specifically with regards to additional food and contingencies that we ve put in place  as you heard in our prepared comments  we have gone ahead with an agreements to lease for used aircraft to go forward for 2020 to help us with any contingency plans should things move  I m obviously not going to get into any details of commercial agreements with Airbus  but I m pleased A  with the dialog we are having with them B  the transparency that s going forward and C  that we have put good mitigants in place should anything change 
Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    Analyst
Okay  Steve  thanks  That s helpful  Sorry  I didn t hear before if you said it  And then just another one on the 321  How are the production delays potentially impacting your expansion plans to Europe  Is there a need  Is there a potential circumstance where you would need to use those planes domestically  and can you update us on where you are on obtaining slots  Thank you 
Steve Priest    Chief Financial Officer
Okay  I ll pick up the aircraft side of things  And then I ll get Joanna  to give an update on the wider perspective with regard to slots  We remain confident on our plans to continue to grow relevance in both New York and Boston  with the European expansion  A great amount of planning is under way  And again  because of the close cooperation with Airbus  we are confident with the delivery timeframes around the A321LR  So I ll hand over to Joanna to give a best perspective in terms of    our perspectives in terms of slots  etc 
Joanna Geraghty    President and Chief Operating Officer
Great  Thanks  Steve  Good morning  We continue to work multiple paths around slots in a number of London area airports  We re confident that our London plans can work in any number of airports and we ll update you  when we have a bit more information to share

Your next question comes from Jamie Baker of JP Morgan  Your line is now open 
Jamie Baker    JP Morgan Securities Inc     Analyst
Hey  good morning everybody  I mean  Joanna I m sorry to ask modeling question and I know you talked about sequential RASM improvement in revenue initiatives going  going forward as the year progresses  But the revenue growth rate and I m shifting from RASM to revenue here  In the first quarter  you re guiding to kind of a 4  plus top line outcome  But this rate needs to more than double in the second half to hit  2 50  I know you ve seen that sort of revenue growth in the past  but could you better break it down into the buckets that help you get there  I mean I think a truly material pickup that s required 
Joanna Geraghty    President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah  So I think I ll first start with capacity  if you look at capacity throughout the year  you should expect stronger revenue in the first half naturally  because capacity is lower  capacity coming in in the second half will pressure    pressure revenue  as you think about the revenue building blocks  So  as Dave mentioned  we have 3 points of contribution associated with our revenue initiatives  We started off the year strong with good improvement from Q4 into Q1  And as we think about the rest of the year  we have good momentum on those initiatives  Dave mentioned about 3 points of benefit with low to mid twos in the first half and then further ramping into the second half of the year with high to mid 3 for a total of the   a total of 3 points  So  as you think about that in the broader context  we started strong and we re on track to continue throughout the year to deliver that  2 50 to  3 of EPS 
Jamie Baker    JP Morgan Securities Inc     Analyst
Okay  that s helpful  So that implies to revenue growth rate  second quarter is your year on year 
Joanna Geraghty    President and Chief Operating Officer
First  I d say the first half is stronger than the back half of the year 
Jamie Baker    JP Morgan Securities Inc     Analyst
Okay  And Steve  just a quick one on the revised guidance standards  how come I mean they ll get me wrong  I m not critical the decision  I m just curious if it was something you heard from your owners if it s just about  kind of going with the flow  just wondering what the thought process was 
Steve Priest    Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  Thank you and good morning  Jamie  I ll just cover a couple of items  The first thing is we reviewed this as we continue to shift toward an EPS guide as we saw it go through this and considered where we are  the core reason behind this is to drive more alignment and I guidance process with the cadence of the industry and we will obviously continue to bring the same level of transparency to analysts and our owners  And maybe just say this opportunity to just to give a little bit more clarity the new cadence you can expect  This morning  as you probably noticed we be much of our investor update  which includes EPS guide  We will give an update on RASM in the mid quarter which is an example  make him like for this quarter in early March  We will continue to give a final updates on RASM best with broader investor update for the quarter  that is actually closing  I m so we ll package out up together  So on the following earnings call we can spend more time thinking about forward looking guidance 
And then  as a result of that  the overall traffic report ends but investors and analysts are not losing any information so primarily  Jamie  it s ensuring alignment with regard to the cadence for the rest of the industry

Thank you  Your next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James  your line is now open 
Savanthi Syth    Raymond James   Associates    Analyst
Hey  good morning  Just first question is just some clarification around the fleet  When do you expect those kind of A321s that were delayed in kind of 2019 and 2020 to kind of show up  And also just on the used aircraft is that beyond kind of the fleet plan that you have on the presentation and other kind of short term leases there  or should we expect them to be in the fleet for kind of more than a couple of years 
Steve Priest    Chief Financial Officer
I ll pick that  Good morning  Savi  So specifically  we look at this with Airbus  on a year by year basis and are going to the next level of quarter by quarter basis as we work through this  And so  as a reminder  we had  had 85 Airbus neo orders on in the order book and we go through the annual progression and so Airbus to continue to deal with their production challenges  But as I said  it s good that we continue to get the visibility  We can forecast accordingly  So for me at the moment is about we  indecipherable  this year by year versus worrying about when will they ultimately come because obviously certain things I m moving to the right  While we ve    we ve actually done in terms of our plan  As I mentioned in the prepared remarks  we have assumed the delivery with 11 of the 14 NEOs in 2020  I m  but it is right of us to be prudent and look around the corner and think about what s happening  and so we have put this agreements in place for the for least used aircraft  which you know  if we see further delays  a further challenges to our business  It gives us some contingency as we go forward  So that s really how you should think about that and I hope that s clear 
Savanthi Syth    Raymond James   Associates    Analyst
And just so is the  is the kind of the 4 that come in  that s in addition to what s in the fleet plan in the slide deck  Correct 
Steve Priest    Chief Financial Officer
That is correct 
Savanthi Syth    Raymond James   Associates    Analyst
Okay  And then just a another fleet question just on the cabin refresh  Could you provide an update on kind of how many were completed at the end of   2019 and just how you re thinking about it for the rest of the year 
Steve Priest    Chief Financial Officer
So as of now  we ve completed 53 of our cabin restyling plan  as you think about the overall plan  We expect to complete the entire plan by I d say early 2021  The original goal was the end of 2020  but due to the Airbus delays  we ve had to adjust the styling scheduled to partially back fill those delays  so that we can maintain our capacity commitments

Thank you  Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays  Your line is now open 
Brandon Oglenski    Barlcays    Analyst
Hey  good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question  So  Joanna  I want to come back to your response  A couple of earlier where I think you said first half revenue trends should o actually be stronger than second half  Were you referring to RASM or yields or were you talking about top line concentrate 
Joanna Geraghty    President and Chief Operating Officer
I was talking about RASM  Okay  And not to be too nuanced here  but it does seem like to hit the EPS range  which is significantly higher than your earnings level  let s call it in the first quarter  you do need to see likely favorable yield contribution even with that higher growth  So  I think you were talking about 3 points of tailwind in the first half  maybe closer to 2 points of tailwind in the back half  how much contingency have you built in there for term fee delays because I was just kind of things and other here  indecipherable   Technical Issues   Sorry  you were just bringing up a little bit but    but I think I caught what you re saying  We    I think I d point you back to the initiatives as we step into 2020  They continue to ramp through the year  we should think about them in terms of the network reallocation  which remains on track with benefits continuing to come in our Fare Options 2 0 and remember that launched systemwide in early December  So  that will continue to ramp through the year and then obviously growth in ancillaries

Thank you  Your next question Catherine O Brien with Goldman Sachs  Your line is now open 
Catherine O Brien    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Hi  everyone  Good morning  So  quite jJust another question on the restyling efforts  I guess  obviously there could potentially be some risk if there are further delays but I guess  how confident are you in that current schedule  And then can you help us frame the benefit of those modifications to CASM ex fuel efficiency this year  Thanks 
Robin Hayes    Chief Executive Officer
Hello  Catherine  I ll pick that up  Just as a overview to Joanna s comments earlier  so we are 53 today  We continue to sort of ramp up  We ve increased the number of lines that we have on the restyling program  which is great  The other thing I would say is that the we consciously decided to try and align the restyling effort with heavy maintenance checks on the airframes as best as we could  And so  obviously if you re doing a full heavy check on the aircraft and doing restyling  the amounts of mod time is higher  So  what we ve seen as we cycle through some of that is a physical mod time per restyling efforts and has reduced and the    on a number of lines that we re pushing through  has increased  So  we continue to get such a good momentum  I think the one thing I would say about the great work  the team has done is we ve used     we ve thought strategically about how we ve continued to approach restyling and with the NEO delays we ve sort of taken a little bit of a pause    a short pause in 2019 as we go forward and we ll continue to reassess that as we go forward  But we remain confident in the plans we have in place  the momentum that s going because it s great both not only for our customers but also from driving margin for JetBlue  Specifically thinking about CASM  ex and the dynamics of the numbers  you should think about restarting providing about 2 points of capacity for 2020 when you do    when you look at your models in terms of the ASMs that that will provide in addition to the incremental shelves that come into the business 
Catherine O Brien    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Great  thanks  And then  is there a point where you will see compensation from Airbus on the ongoing delivery delays  I guess like if that s true  is there any downside risk to your capex    capex figures  Thanks 
Robin Hayes    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  Catherine  Obviously  it will be inappropriate for me to comment on any sort of commercial discussions that we have with Airbus on an earnings call  We continue to engage with them  our continuous priorities is to    to make sure we maintain the integrity of our schedule  we deliver for our customers and we get the aircraft on to so JetBlue s property  But at the same time  obviously this has been an incredible challenge for JetBlue  as we ve navigated this over the last couple of years and we continue the commercial discussions with Airbus

Your next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen  Your line is now open 
Conor Cunningham    Cowen    Analyst
Hey guys  it s actually Conor Cunningham in for Helane  Just on Puerto Rico  I know it s early days there  I mean you talked about a 50 basis point headwind occurring in 1Q  Just curious if your expectation is for that to linger into at least 2Q at this point  I m just trying to get a sense that you know for how long that may    that may be impactful  And I know that you  you talked about making capacity adjustments  Just curious on where the incremental capacity is going 
Joanna Geraghty    President and Chief Operating Officer
Sure 
Conor Cunningham    Cowen    Analyst
Thanks 
Joanna Geraghty    President and Chief Operating Officer
Thanks  So let me just start with Puerto Rico remains a important part of our network  It s been a significant margin contributor  And we see these pressures from time to time in Puerto Rico and the rest of the industry  I think if you look at last year and some of the changes we made in Punta Cana  we ve demonstrated that we will not shy away from taking temporary capacity adjustments to right size the current market and demand conditions  That said  we remain very committed to Puerto Rico  we do expect to make temporary capacity adjustments in the short term  it s difficult to forecast the impact to Puerto Rico  If you look at history with NASA enduring  it would tell you that this    this could linger other examples have these situations coming off much sooner  So  we re watching it closely  We re doing our best to forecast what we think the impact is and taking tactical adjustments to    to mitigate the demand environment as needed 
Conor Cunningham    Cowen    Analyst
Okay and then just on the network  maybe to continue that just    so you made a lot of adjustments  And I know you made some more in Long Beach  just curious if like  if that s been rationalized enough at this point or maybe you can kind of talk to your process into how you adjust your network longer term  Thank you 
Joanna Geraghty    President and Chief Operating Officer
Sure  So every city and every route has to earn its way into our network  The reallocations that we have done over the last year and a half are on track and we continue to see the benefits of those changes coming in  Our focus is on growing out our key focus cities  including Boston and Fort Lauderdale  And we will adjust the network to ensure that we are meeting  not only our capacity commitments  but also our strategic    our strategic focus city plan

Joseph DeNardi    Stifel    Analyst
Yeah  thanks  Good morning  Steve or Robin  you guys have clearly had the earnings guidance for this year out there for a while and you ve stuck by it despite a lot of    lot of changes  Can you just talk about  given that we re a little bit closer to it is the high end or the low end more within reach for you all  Thanks 
Robin Hayes    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  Thanks  John  I ll take that as  indecipherable  to answer a question yet really  But no  look  I think that I m very pleased  There were a lot of skeptics a few years ago  at our delivery on our cost commitments  And I think that we have continued to demonstrate that we have laid out exactly what we said what we were going to do  I think the benefits on restyling a network are on track  Fare options  it s very early  but we re very pleased with what we re seeing  And as Dave mentioned  we have a team in Revenue Management and our data science team who are sort of monitoring that daily to make sure that we are getting all the benefits we expect from Fair Options and more  I m very pleased with the sequential change in the RASM from Q4 to Q1  Actually I haven t seen a number like that at JetBlue in terms of the change other than the Easter or Passover holiday since 2016  And again  if it wasn t for the Puerto Rico impact which has been very significant  we would be looking at a 2 0 guide into Q1  And we continue to see the revenue initiatives ramp up  And so  I think that gives me a lot of optimism  Now  obviously there are risks that we don t control  All we can do when those risks emerge is doing what we can do  mitigate them  I think we ve talked about that today  on some of the actions that we ve taken in Puerto Rico  And I also  we ve seen some of our initiatives outperform as well 
So as we sit here  all of those things together  give us confidence in the  2 50 to  3 number  There are some tailwinds that would help us  there are also some headwinds that could create some pressure  So industry capacity growth has been something that has been talked about  We ve talked a lot about the macro revenue environment  I mean  again  there were a lot of question on that  on the last call  We believe our revenue initiatives will allow us to deliver positive RASM  even if the macro number is negative  but clearly there is a risk there  So  as we go through the year and we get a better line of sight on some of those things that we don t control both headwind and tailwinds will    we re tightening the range  we ll adjust the range to keep everyone sort of up to date  But I m very confident where we are now and even a consensus  which everyone knows is below  2 50 to  3  We re going to have industry leading earnings growth in 2020 by some mile  And so everyone here  I can tell you    everyone here is very  very focused on the  2 50 to  3 and we re giving everything we ve got  And I think we ve seen that on many of initiatives that we ve rolled out today 
Joseph DeNardi    Stifel    Analyst
That s helpful  Robin  And then maybe just a question for Dave or Scott  if I exclude the revenue initiatives from the first quarter guide  It is pretty weak even with lower capacity growth  So  why is an underlying just kind of core pricing power given what seems to be kind of healthy demand  infact that your own capacity growth is pretty low industry growth is relatively modest  It kind of suggest that just underlying program is great  There is some erosion or that the accretion from these initiatives  it isn t as great maybe you think 
Joanna Geraghty    President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah  I mean I think I just say that there is sequential improvement as you look at Q4 to Q1 and the progress we re making there and then Q1 into Q2  we re pleased with the improvements and the revenue initiatives just add to that  And as they ramp up through the year  they will contribute to that sequential improvement

Your next question comes from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank  Your line is now open 
Michael Linenberg    Deutsche Bank    Analyst
Hey two quick ones here  I guess maybe  Robin and Steve  I want to say Robin  it s admirable that JetBlue  as a company is planning to be carbon neutral for 2020 and I m just curious  it would seem that there is some cost associated with that  and yet you re maintaining the  250 to  300  So one  any sort of a sense that you can give on what the potential cost of being carbon neutral even round numbers  And then from a CASM  ex perspective I presume anything that s tied to carbon fuel et cetera  finds its way into the ex part of the cost equation  Is that the right way to look at it 
Robin Hayes    Chief Executive Officer
Hi  Mike  I appreciate the question and I will get to it  but I d like to just maybe use this as an opportunity to kind of explain what we ve done and why we ve done it  I mean we do look at sustainability through a lens of long term shareholder value creation  I think that  but the airline industry  this issue percent a clear and present danger if we don t get on top of it and I ll seem to be out ahead of it  We see that in other geographies and we should not assume that those sentiments I come to the US  And so it s very important that airlines get on the front foot of this  which is why we did what we did  And you know  frankly  as part of sort of our border yes the commitment across of course many and I talked about some of those in my comments  So  that s why    that s why we did it  I do think it s going to become a cost of doing business  for the industry  In terms of specifically actual a question around the offsets  then I m not going to get into that  I will say that it s fully factored into our EPS guide  I mean in terms of where it sits in the line  it s treated as part of our fuel cost  so it won t be in the ex fuel CASM line  it will be in the fuel guidance  So  as we will continue to roll out quarterly fuel guidance then it will be included in that  but again the the cost of the investment of this is factored into the EPS guide that we provided 
Michael Linenberg    Deutsche Bank    Analyst
Great  And then just a quick  My second question  just if you were to sort of characterize how do you think about your relationship with Norwegian or are they just another sort of Interline partner or they is something more than that  And the reason I ask is that when they announced that they had definitely you it with a full page press release lots of superlatives about JetBlue  it looked like it was something big and yet I m not sure if it is all that big  I m just curious about how you would characterize that relationship  Thank you

Steve Priest    Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  good morning Myles  Firstly  I wanted to say a big thank you to the team at JetBlue  particularly that the fleet treasury and tech ops team who ve done a magnificent job I have  last 2 5 years in terms of aligning and renegotiating all of our engine contracts  This was the final piece of the jigsaw in terms of both our airframe and engine maintenance contracts to to help JetBlue navigate through the next few years  This    this contract specifically covering half of our engines on our existing CO fleet will bring benefits throughout the 2020 year so you should think about that when you are baking in your models  And then just a clarification on the retirement  I guess it s not retiring any in 2020  Should we think about them ratably retiring though the  20s come in  in 2021 yeah  I think the way that you should think about this is as a one for one replacement as the A220s coming based on our discussions with Airbus  particularly Airbus Canada and how we take things forward  We remain confident in the delivery of our first A220 at the end of this year  Obviously  we will take a couple of months again to service as we go through that in the first aircraft come into the fleet  But then you are going to have a short transition time between and A220 coming in and A190 going out for a number of months  So  as they come in we ve shared with you the order book that we have and you can so I think as that as a one for one replacement as a 2  one is coming  the A190 just go out

Hi  good morning  Thanks  Two questions here  first of all Fair Point 2 0 all based on what I m seeing the segmentation component  It doesn t look like it s being dynamically priced at this point  So  the question is  are there IT limitations from that prevent you from doing that 
Joanna Geraghty    President and Chief Operating Officer
Sure  Thanks for the question  Maybe I ll just start with fare options you know on what we re seeing in terms of the progress so far  So  as I mentioned rolled out in December  95  of the boot basic fares are now available across our network  we are off to a good start  benefits will continue to ramp and we are  as we see it so far exceeding expectations in terms of the upsell and the buy up rates  it will continue to evolve as we step through the next few months in terms of a variety of factors around just dynamic pricing  but also as we learn more around how fare options works in different markets  The team will get smarter in terms of of how we offer    how we offer the different the different bundles  And Dave  is there anything you d like to add 
Dave Clark    Vice President of Sales and Revenue Management
Just that we re very pleased with the rollout and this year the big focus will be how do we optimize all of the biopsy  the  indecipherable  extra of the seat pricing  Looking at both traditional and new methods to optimize those as because of the year 
Dan McKenzie    Buckingham Research    Analyst
I see  OK  And then going back to one of the big revenue drivers for this year   34 per passenger in ancillary revenue growing double digits and please correct me on that  But what are the components that are driving that growth exactly I mean a big things  of course  but what are the other big drivers that are in there 
Dave Clark    Vice President of Sales and Revenue Management
Yeah  sure  So  maybe I ll step  Phonetic  has been loyalty is the largest driver behind the double digit growth  Then you could think of bag fees  we ll see an increase in bag fees this year  largely associated with fare options in the unbundling of bag fees and then there is a contribution from JetBlue Travel products as well into our ancillary revenue numbers  So  overall very pleased with the growth  Yes  34 customer up 14  year over year  we expect as we step into 2020 to see strong growth throughout the year as well

JBLU data by YCharts
Takeaways from JetBlue s fourth quarter 2019 earnings
There was a lot more for investors to smile about than JetBlue s slight beat on fourth quarter earnings  The biggest positive from the report was JetBlue s first quarter 2020 revenue per available seat mile  RASM  forecast of 0  to 3  compared to Q1 2019  RASM is a key revenue metric for airlines  JetBlue had been struggling with RASM growth  posting a 2 7  decline in Q4 2019 compared to Q4 2018  That performance was in line with expectations of a 0 5  to 3 5  decline  What makes JetBlue s positive RASM growth even more impressive is that it comes during an expectedly low growth year according to competitors United Airlines and Delta Air Lines 
Another positive for JetBlue was its 6  capacity growth  which was on the higher end of guidance of 4 5  to 6 5   Capacity growth indicates larger planes with bigger fuel tanks are being utilized to accommodate more passengers per flight  JetBlue expects capacity to rise 1 5  to 3 5  in Q1 2020 and total 2020 capacity growth to be 5 5  to 7 5   JetBlue s anticipated capacity growth is impressive considering capacity grew 6 6  in 2019  JetBlue attributes its capacity growth to network expansion and additional seats from its cabin restyling program  
On the earnings side  JetBlue reaffirmed its forecast of  2 50 to  3 earnings per share  EPS   which it had guided for in the third quarter of 2019  At the current price  JetBlue would have a foreword P E ratio of 6 8 to 8 1  placing it in value stock territory from a valuation perspective  
Sustainability in mind
In the era of Environmental  Social  and Governance  ESG  investment funds  companies that have a long term focus on sustainability mean more than just a greener future  According to the Energy Information Administration  EIA    petroleum products accounted for about 92  of the total U S  transportation sector energy use  in 2018  Jet fuel made up 12  of the total fuel used in transportation  Airlines could become increasingly pressured to transition from jet fuel use in the future  JetBlue is attempting to be ahead of the curve when it comes to sustainability 
During the company s fourth quarter 2019 call  CEO Robin Hayes said   We are the first major US airline to announce carbon neutral domestic flights  We have also procured sustainable aviation fuel for flight out of San Francisco  giving us early access to this lower carbon fuel     positioning us to move faster on supply in the future   

The Boeing effect
The impact of the Boeing 737 MAX groundings on Boeing and major U S  airlines alike cannot be ignored  Fortunately for JetBlue  the company is the only major U S  airline that doesn t operate Boeing planes in its fleet  Alaska Air Group  another smaller U S  airline  as well as Delta  the largest U S  airline by market capitalization  currently do not have grounded MAX planes either  but both fly Boeing planes in their fleets  As long as the MAX remains grounded  JetBlue will have an advantage over competitors who expected to have the planes operating in their fleet in time for the summer travel season  No one really knows when that will happen  but on Jan  21  2020  Boeing announced a further delay in its anticipated ungrounding of the 737 MAX  stating expectations for mid 2020  On Jan  24  the FAA said it was  pleased with Boeing s progress in recent weeks toward achieving key milestones   signaling the ungrounding could come more recently than Boeing had expected  
A unique airline
Overall  JetBlue s fourth quarter earnings were more of a relief cry in response to the prospect of finally growing RASM  JetBlue s short term edge as an airline without exposure to Boeing s woes  as well as its long term sustainability focus  provide an interesting combination  However  JetBlue s lack of a dividend may dissuade some income investors since other high quality airlines pay a dividend  If JetBlue continues to grow RASM in a period of slow to mild growth for airlines  it could pull ahead as one of the better airlines to invest in ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppfy9,2072943

Challenges for JetBlue
Similar to the second smallest major U S  airline by market capitalization  Alaska Air  NYSE ALK   JetBlue has coverage throughout major cities in the U S  but also specializes in a particular region  For JetBlue  that region is Latin America  specifically the Caribbean  During its third quarter 2019 conference call  CFO Stephen Priest notes revenue challenges in JetBlue s Latin America Caribbean region  contributing to revenue growth of just 4  year over year  
For a while now  JetBlue has been struggling with revenue growth  and that struggle looks to continue  The company s COO  Joanna Geraghty   expects low single digit RASM growth for 2020  
RASM  or revenue per available seat mile  is a key revenue metric for airlines  Although in line with guidance  RASM declined 0 9  year over year in Q3 2019 and is expected to fall 0 5  to 3 5  year over year for Q4 2019  which the company will report Jan  23   

Positives for JetBlue
JetBlue s anticipated revenue declines come despite capacity increases that are forecasted to be between 4 5  and 6 5  in Q4 2019  resulting in an impressive total 2019 increase of 6  to 7   
Also on the positive side  JetBlue s fleet is predominately Airbus and Embraer aircraft  meaning it isn t as impacted by the Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX scandal as rivals Southwest Airlines  American Airlines  and United Airlines  JetBlue is the only major U S  airline that doesn t operate Boeing planes in its fleet  meaning JetBlue should have no problem filling its expected 15 Airbus orders for 2020 

JBLU Price to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts
Another positive is JetBlue s earnings forecast  which is  2 50 to  3 for 2020  At a current price of around  18 70 per share  JetBlue s forward P E ratio would be 6 23 to 7 48  placing the stock in value territory  Another strong suit for JetBlue is its EBITDA margin  which is second only to Southwest at a solid 17  
The EBITDA margin is a company s operating profit as a percentage of revenue  providing an accurate reading of actual performance  EBITDA margin is a transparent indicator of a company s true profitability  meaning that JetBlue s current operations are impressive  That being said  slowing revenue growth paired with increased capacity could mean that margins will decline in the future unless JetBlue can reverse its trend of negative RASM growth 
All in all  JetBlue remains only about average relative to its peers in forward P E and price to free cash flow  FCF   Price to FCF is an important metric to determine the cost of a stock relative to its FCF  Free cash flow is a means to fund growth outside of typical operations  such as returning cash to shareholders in the form of a dividend or buying back stock  In terms of its finances  JetBlue looks decent but not great compared to its peers 
Just OK
For an airline  JetBlue appears fairly mediocre  JetBlue and United Airlines are the only two of the six major U S  airlines to not pay a dividend  In terms of growth  negative RASM is disconcerting  especially considering Alaska Air is guiding for 1  to 4   RASM growth compared to Q4 2018  American Airlines  which is hurting from the MAX scandal  originally guided for 0  to 2  RASM growth year over year in Q4 2019 but then guided down to 0  to 1  on Jan  13  threatening to end its 12 quarter RASM growth streak  Still  the fact that JetBlue doesn t have Boeing planes in its fleet and is still guiding for negative RASM is a glaring red flag for investors 
JetBlue isn t a bad stock  but compared to other airlines such as Delta Air Lines  which recently blew past expectations  it lacks a differentiating factor to make it worth consideration at this time ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plvp3,2065953
179421,400937,JBLU,Should Value Investors Consider JetBlue Airways  JBLU  Now ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put JetBlue Airways Corporation   NASDAQ JBLU   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  JetBlue Airways has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 04  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 76  If we focus on the long term PE trend  JetBlue Airways  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Transportation sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that JetBlue Airways has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 67  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for JetBlue Airways stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  JetBlue Airways has a P S ratio of about 0 69  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 42 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  JBLU is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of overvalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  JetBlue Airways currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes JetBlue Airways a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the PEG ratio for JetBlue Airways is just 0 57  a level that is lower than the industry average of 0 62  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  JBLU is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall  Though JetBlue Airways might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F  This gives JBLU a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores     Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to four higher  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen two downward revision compared to three upward in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has improved by 1 6  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has increased by 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below JetBlue Airways Corporation Price and Consensus
 
   Despite this positive trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  JetBlue Airways is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 29  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Transportation   Airline has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through Q3 2019  while the S P 500 gained  39 6   five of our strategies returned  51 8    57 5    96 9    119 0   and even  158 9  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   Q3 2019  while the S P averaged  5 6  per year  our top strategies averaged up to  54 1  per year ",2019-12-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-consider-jetblue-airways-jblu-now-200492875,200492875

179427,400943,JBLU,JetBlue Will Go Carbon Neutral on Domestic Flights,news,"Air travel has been a growth industry over the past decade  and especially for the past five years  Consumers have taken to the skies more often  part of a broader shift in discretionary spending away from  stuff  and toward travel and other experiences  It certainly hasn t hurt that inflation adjusted airfares are near record lows in the U S  thanks to the rapid growth of budget carriers  U S  airlines carried more than 800 million passengers on domestic routes during the 12 month period that ended in September  up from a little more than 600 million a decade earlier 
However   flight shaming  represents a rising risk to this growth trend  As the public becomes more aware of the environmental impact of air travel  some consumers have resolved to try to fly less frequently  or even stop doing so altogether 
Now  JetBlue Airways  NASDAQ JBLU  hopes it has an answer to the concerns of environmentally conscious travelers  Last week  the trendy low fare carrier announced that it will offset the carbon emissions for all its domestic flights starting in July 2020 

What JetBlue is doing
JetBlue has already been offsetting some of its carbon emissions through a partnership with Carbonfund org  It will now expand that relationship while also partnering with EcoAct and South Pole on additional carbon offset projects 
Beginning in July  the airline expects to offset a total of 15 billion to 17 billion pounds of carbon dioxide emissions annually    equivalent to the emissions from all of its domestic flights  and little over 70  of its global capacity  JetBlue plans to fund a variety of carbon offset projects  with a particular focus on forest conservation  landfill gas capture  and solar  and wind power plant construction 
In addition  JetBlue will invest in reducing its emissions    or at least in mitigating the impact of the company s growth  Among other things  it will use renewable jet fuel  blended with regular jet fuel  on flights from San Francisco beginning later this year  This sustainable fuel has a carbon footprint that is as much as 80  lower than traditional fossil fuel derived jet fuel  according to the company 
Finally  JetBlue will dramatically improve its fuel efficiency thanks to the purchase of nearly 150 next generation aircraft it has ordered for delivery over the next six years  Most notably  the 70 Airbus A220 300s it has on order will be up to 40  more fuel efficient than the aircraft they will replace 
The cost should be manageable
JetBlue didn t say how much it will cost to offset its domestic carbon emissions  but the figure s not likely to break the bank  Carbonfund org sells air travel offsets to individuals for as little as  10 per metric ton of carbon dioxide  Based on that price  JetBlue s targeted offset purchases would cost  70 million to  80 million before taxes  That would reduce annual earnings per share by a maximum of  0 20    less than 10  of analysts  consensus estimate for 2020 EPS of  2 38 
The actual net cost is likely to be considerably lower  For one thing  Carbonfund has to cover its overhead costs and fundraising costs out of individual donations  so the impact per dollar should be higher for a company willing to spend tens of millions of dollars on carbon offsets 
Additionally  in the press release announcing this initiative  the company stated   JetBlue will offer ways for the airline s customers and communities to connect with the carbon offsetting projects JetBlue is engaging with   This likely means it will make a bigger push to persuade individual customers to offset the carbon impact of their flights  thus passing some of the cost of going carbon neutral along to willing customers directly 
Becoming the first U S  airline to offer carbon neutral flights could be a great strategy for JetBlue  As noted above  the net cost will likely be quite modest relative to its total earnings power  And being recognized as more environmentally friendly than its peers could pay off in a big way if it increases customers  loyalty   Notably  JetBlue s two largest markets by far are the liberal bastions of New York City and Boston   It will be interesting to see how this initiative plays out over the next few years  and if it seems to drive an increase in customers  preference for JetBlue ",2020-01-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgteg,2057430

179434,400950,JBLU,Southwest Airlines Is Chasing JetBlue Out of Long Beach  California,news,"Less than two years ago  JetBlue Airways  NASDAQ JBLU  announced major cutbacks in Long Beach  California  its smallest focus city  At the time  the carrier was operating up to 35 daily departures in Long Beach  However  it slashed that number by a third after Labor Day in 2018 
JetBlue s decision to shrink in Long Beach enabled other airlines to expand at the slot constrained airport  particularly Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   In fact  Southwest has grown in several markets that JetBlue serves from Long Beach  putting further pressure on JetBlue s results there  Not surprisingly  JetBlue announced earlier this week that it plans to make further cutbacks in Long Beach a few months from now 

Long Beach  an unusual market
Long Beach Airport is one of several smaller airports surrounding Los Angeles International Airport  LAX   Local noise ordinances place strict limits on commercial flights in Long Beach  For many years  the limit was 41 daily departures  but that number has increased in recent years as improved jet engine technology has reduced noise levels  In 2019  the limit was 50 daily departures  and the limit is set to rise to 53 in 2020 
Back in 2001  very few of the slots were in use  That enabled JetBlue  then a young airline start up  to enter the market and quickly build up a fortress hub that was immune to competition  Its low fares for flights to various cities on both coasts and premium amenities helped it quickly attract a following in Long Beach 
However  high fuel prices eventually made many of JetBlue s transcontinental routes unprofitable  Meanwhile  increased competition at LAX led to lower fares there  eroding JetBlue s price advantage  As a result  it stopped fully utilizing its nearly three dozen Long Beach slot pairs  That allowed other airlines to expand    at first with temporary slot allocations  and later with permanent slots that JetBlue was forced to relinquish 
Southwest has come for JetBlue s customers
Before 2016  Long Beach was the only one of the five Los Angeles area commercial airports Southwest Airlines didn t serve  Considering Southwest s strong brand and leading position in the California market  it was something of an anomaly that the low cost airline giant didn t offer any flights in Long Beach 

In early 2016  Southwest announced that it would finally enter the Long Beach market  using new slots that became available in that year  It launched service in Long Beach on June 5  2016  with four daily flights to Oakland  one of its largest focus cities  The carrier subsequently added nonstop flights to Sacramento in 2017  And after JetBlue s 2018 cutbacks  it was able to gain even more slots in Long Beach  That allowed it to add service to San Jose  California and Las Vegas 
Oakland  Sacramento  San Jose  and Las Vegas are four of the cities that JetBlue currently serves from Long Beach  However  Southwest Airlines is the dominant carrier at all four airports  Not surprisingly  Southwest has been winning this competitive battle 
As a result  JetBlue announced on Wednesday that it will exit the Oakland market in late April  ending its flights to New York and Boston as well as to Long Beach  The airline also said it would reduce or eliminate service on half a dozen routes from Long Beach around the same time  That includes dropping its flights to Sacramento and San Jose and cutting back from three to two daily flights to Las Vegas 
This isn t the end
After this round of cutbacks  JetBlue will be down to 10 destinations served nonstop from Long Beach  one of which is served only seasonally  Those destinations are Boston  Las Vegas  New York City  Salt Lake City  San Francisco  and Seattle  along with Austin  Texas  Bozeman  Montana  Portland  Oregon  and Reno  Nevada  Meanwhile  at least 10 more slot pairs will be up for grabs in Long Beach 
Southwest is likely to get the lion s share  It could use some of those to add service to Austin  another market where it s dominant  and one or more of the major West Coast markets that it doesn t serve from Long Beach yet  Delta Air Lines is also interested and could bolster service to its Salt Lake City hub and or add flights to its growing Seattle hub 
The bottom line is that the more JetBlue shrinks in Long Beach  the more slots will be available to support other airlines  growth there  Perhaps there are a handful of markets where nobody will be interested in challenging JetBlue  However  the only markets from Long Beach where JetBlue has a clear competitive advantage are the flights to New York and Boston  its two biggest focus cities 
Shrinking in Long Beach is the right move for JetBlue  The carrier recently confirmed that its unit revenue declined last quarter  which highlights its need to jettison underperforming flights  However  it might have been better to rip off the bandage and eliminate everything other than the New York and Boston routes in Long Beach  The slots it will have to surrender because of its latest cuts will just allow rivals  especially Southwest  to grow further in Long Beach  putting more pressure on JetBlue s operation there and forcing further cuts in the years ahead ",2020-01-19,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pj-a1,2062793

179468,400984,JBLU,Exclusive  Brazil to lure airlines to fly domestic  taking meetings with three carriers,news,"BRASILIA  Reuters    Brazil is determined to lure airlines to operate domestic flights in Latin America s largest aviation market  and is taking meetings with at least three carriers  a senior government official told Reuters 
 We are going to talk with  Jet Blue   we are going to talk with Volaris  a Mexican group     we are going to talk with Sky Airline  which is Chilean   Ronei Glanzmann  Brazil s civil aviation secretary  told Reuters on the sidelines of the ALTA Airline Leaders Forum  an industry conference 
 These are conversations to introduce Brazil to them  they do not mean that the airlines are saying that they will come here   he added 
Glanzmann said the meetings with Volaris and JetBlue Airways Corp  O JBLU  will take place on Monday 
A representative for Sky said they had canceled their participation in the ALTA conference due to the civil unrest in Chile  but declined to comment on taking a meeting with the Brazilian government  Jet Blue and Volaris did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Brazil s government has recently begun a push to open its aviation market  the largest in Latin America  Right wing president Jair Bolsonaro has allowed foreign carriers to set up domestic carriers in the country 
Currently  Brazil s domestic air travel market is highly concentrated among three airlines  Until earlier this year  there was a fourth player  Avianca Brasil  but the airline stopped operations in May after filing for bankruptcy operations late last year  highlighting the high risk and volatility of operating in Brazil 
Reaction to Brazil s liberalization been slow  but already Spanish airline group Globalia has declared its intention to operate a domestic airline in Brazil  But Glanzmann hopes others will too 
His strategy  he said  involves airlines dipping their toes in the Brazilian market first by operating international flights 
 We are working first with international routes  but we are already working so that those operations will become domestic operations in the Brazilian market   Glanzmann said 
In the past year  four foreign low cost airlines have begun operating international flights to Brazil  JetSMART  which belongs to Indigo Partners  Sky Airline  Norwegian Air Shuttle  OL NWC  and Argentina s Flybondi 
Still  some industry watchers are skeptical that anyone will attempt to enter Brazil s domestic market anytime soon 
 We don t see anything changing in the short term regarding a new low cost airline operating domestically   said Eduardo Sanovicz  who heads ABEAR  an industry group that represents Brazil s two largest airlines   For a company to start flying in Brazil  they will need to know that they will have the same costs as we do  
Brazil s carriers have long complained about high costs of operating in Brazil  especially value added taxes on fuel that can be as high as 25  ",2019-10-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-brazil-to-lure-airlines-to-fly-domestic-taking-meetings-with-three-carriers-2005182,2005182
179469,400985,JBLU,Why Brazil s bid to lure low cost airlines may be doomed,news,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
BRASILIA  Reuters    Brazilian government officials this week tempted airline executives with a pitch  Latin America s largest domestic aviation market is opening up and it badly needs more competition 
Promises abounded to lure low cost carriers to fly domestic routes 
The infrastructure minister promised to double the number of passengers in Brazil s skies  A monopoly on jet fuel by government controlled Petrobras  SA PETR4  is set to end  An  18 fee charged on every international flight ticket was scrapped 
But many industry veterans say that the new promises and recent reforms are not enough  and the country remains an unattractive money pit littered with barriers 
 It won t happen under the current conditions   Peter Cerda  vice president for the Americas at industry group IATA  told Reuters   You can have infrastructure  You can be the largest market in the continent  But if you re costly   new airlines  aren t going to come  
Brazil transported 118 million passengers in 2018  20  more than Mexico  Latin America s No  2 market 
However  experts say airlines in Brazil struggle with sky high fuel taxes  labor costs and legal liabilities   as well as lack of access to the coveted Congonhas airport in Sao Paulo  where the landing slots are fully booked 
Brazil s domestic market is controlled by just three airlines who dominate Congonhas  schedule  meaning a new competitor would have to find its footing elsewhere  a hard pill to swallow 
Those already operating in the country are not particularly profitable  Brazilian carriers lost 10 5 billion reais   2 62 billion  in the last five years  according to L E K  a consulting firm  while local executives do not strike an encouraging tone 
Brazil has historically housed two or three domestic carriers but recently had four  until Avianca Brasil folded in May  Eleven airlines   including former flag carrier Varig   have failed in Brazil so far this century 
 So  is it the case that only incompetent people are in charge in our industry    asked sarcastically Paulo Kakinoff  chief executive of Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes  SA GOLL4   describing the failure rate as  terrifying  
Gol  Brazil s largest domestic airline  has lost 9 billion reais since 2008  The market s No  2 carrier  LATAM Airlines Group  SN LTM   lost 440 million reais in Brazil in 2018 
To be sure  Brazil has made significant free market reforms aimed at lowering costs  It has cleared the way for foreigners to establish domestic airlines in Brazil  although only one airline group has publicly expressed interest  Spain s Globalia  Brazil is also privatizing many airports and most of its states have lowered their jet fuel taxes 
 Welcome to the land of freedom  welcome to Brazil   said Jose Ricardo Botelho  the director of the airlines regulator  on Sunday at a conference held by a regional industry group 
LOW COSTS WELCOME
Brazil has set its sights on attracting so called ultra low cost airlines  which can disrupt the market 
The country s Civil Aviation Secretary  Ronei Glanzmann  told Reuters this week that he has been courting Norwegian Air Shuttle  OL NWC   Indigo Partners  JetSMART  Mexico s Volaris  MX VOLARA  and Chile s Sky Airline  He also met with JetBlue Airways Corp  O JBLU  
Glanzmann said he was  very optimistic  but acknowledged that so far no commitments had been made 
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Twitter on Wednesday that low cost carriers would arrive  soon    lowering prices on domestic flights  
Brazil has already lured some ultra low cost airlines to fly internationally  including Norwegian  Sky Airline and JetSMART 
But international routes are exempted from jet fuel taxes  unlike domestic flights  and cheaper operational costs in the destinations abroad help keep costs below those for serving Brazil exclusively 
Fares in Brazil are at historic lows  averaging  100 each way in 2018  Gol averaged  88  But expenses are high  preventing the efficiencies that allow carriers like Ireland s Ryanair Holdings  I RYA  to turn a profit 
 The difference is that Ryanair can make money at  88 a ticket and Gol cannot   said Carlos Ozores  from consulting firm ICF 
Gol does not think fares can fall much more 
 I don t think that sustainably a competitor could produce much lower costs than ours   Kakinoff said on a conference call with investors on Thursday 
In 2018  airlines in Latin America lost  1 70 for each passenger they transported  according to L E K  making it the worst performing airline region in the world  Compare that with the most profitable region  North America  at  14 70 per passenger 
Losing  5 20 per passenger  the worst performing market of all those surveyed was Brazil 
This year  ALTA forecasts that airlines in Latin America on average will make  0 50 per passenger

179495,401011,JBLU,Exploit The Short Term Dip With These 5 Great Value Picks,opinion,On Aug 5  U S  stocks suffered their worst single day decline of the year  The immediate trigger for such reverses was an escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China  President Trump s decision to impose fresh tariffs on Chinese imports sparked off the latest confrontation between the two countries Things came to a head when China retaliated fiercely  allowing the yuan to plunge to its lowest level in more than a decade  But the equity market rout actually began when Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated after the recent rate cut that a long reduction cycle was not about to begin Despite recent reverses  leading market watchers believe that the carnage will only continue for a few more weeks  The U S  economy remains robust and is unlikely to slip into a near term recession  This is why it makes sense to benefit from the dip by adding select value picks to your portfolio S P 500 Loses  1 4 Trillion in Less Than a Week  Four devastating trading days were all it took to erase  1 4 trillion of the S P 500 s stock value  The Fed s first rate cut in more than a decade had been more or less priced in by the markets  But Powell s characterization of the reduction as simply a  midcycle adjustment  created panic among investors Powell went on to elaborate on this point  stressing that the rate cut was not the beginning of a longer cycle of reductions  As a result  the S P 500 closed 1  lower on Jul 31  The plunge for equities worsened the very next day after Trump brought the U S  China trade war truce to an end The U S  President said he was imposing a 10  tariff on  300 billion worth of Chinese goods from Sep 1  The announcement caught investors off guard causing the Dow to suffer its worst weekly decline of 2019 China s decision to allow the yuan to plunge to a record low on Aug 5 only worsened matters  The country s government also asked state owned enterprises to cease purchases of U S  agricultural goods and threatened to levy tariffs on goods it had already imported  As a result  the S P 500 closed the day nearly 3  lower Tough Weeks Ahead  Rebound LikelyAccording to Mislav Matejka  JPMorgan s   NYSE JPM   head of global and European equity  markets are likely to suffer a few more miserable weeks  But Matejka thinks the decline is a good opportunity for investors and they should  look to buy the dip  In a note to investors  Matejka stressed that the current difficult phase was  an opportunity to add  stocks to investor portfolios  He said that it was extremely likely that equities across the world would  advance further before the next U S  recession strikes  Matejka also thinks that it was  premature to expect a recession over the next quarters   This is because the labor market remains robust and a recession has never started in the United States when  the unemployment rate was falling   In fact  earnings have exceeded expectations and several companies have raised their yearly guidance Our ChoicesRecent equity market reverses have led to widespread panic among investors  But analysts and market watchers think that though the pain will continue for a few more weeks  a rebound will eventually follow  The U S  economy remains largely robust and recent earnings have also exceeded expectations This is why it would be a good idea to pick up undervalued stocks on the dip  Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Value Score and Zacks Rank We narrowed down our choices with the help of our new  Our research

179496,401012,JBLU,5 Top Ranked  Low Beta Stock Picks Amid Market Volatility,opinion,Wall Street is reeling under volatility ever since the trade negotiation between the United States and China snapped in early May  Although  the three major stock indexes    the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite    are still in the positive territory with double digit returns  the momentum that we saw in the first four months of this year is currently lost  Moreover  a less than expected dovish stance adopted by the Fed added to the woes At this juncture  it will be prudent to invest in low beta stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to keep one s portfolio safe from day to day market fluctuations  The beta is equal to 1  which means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock

179674,401190,JBLU,7 Low Price to Sales Stocks With Strong Winning Prospects,opinion,When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying  that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth  Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the price to sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median

Inside Our Surprise Prediction
Among the big six  Delta Air Lines Inc     NYSE DAL    is likely to report today before market opens  At the time of writing  Delta has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an Earnings ESP of  0 07   This lowers the predictive power of ESP because a favorable Zacks Rank when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Zacks Rank  2 United Continental Holdings Inc     NASDAQ UAL    is likely to report on Jan 15  after market closes  It has an Earnings ESP of  13 26   When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  it means a beat is possibly around the corner  Both stocks have a VGM Score of A and hail from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 14   
On Jan 24  American Airlines Group  with a Zacks Rank  2 and an ESP of  3 85   will report earnings results  It doesn t make it a sure shot candidate for an earnings beat  It has a VGM Score of B 
Alaska Air Group Inc     NYSE ALK    is expected to report on Jan 24 after the market opens  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 and an ESP of  2 13   Here also  surprise prediction is tough  ALK has a VGM Score of B 
On Jan 24  JetBlue Airways Corporation    NASDAQ JBLU    is likely to come up with its earnings release  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and an ESP of  14 51   This once again makes earnings beat prediction difficult  The airlines has a VGM Score of B 
Southwest Airlines Co     NYSE LUV    is likely to come up with their earnings releases on Jan 24  Southwest Airlines has a Zacks Rank  3 and an ESP of  2 69   When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  it shows that a beat is possibly around the corner  The stock also has a good VGM Score of A 
What DoesSurprise Prediction Say 
Despite a pool of negative ESPs  some of the airlines may beat  but that it would be on already lower expectations  Still  if the whole lot manages to beat this season  stocks and the pure play ETF US Global Jets ETF    KL JETS    may definitely find some support

179676,401192,JBLU,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Colfax  MGM  BMC  JetBlue And Diamondrock,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 15  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Colfax Corp    NYSE CFX    MGM Growth Properties LLC   NYSE MGP    BMC Stock Holdings   NASDAQ BMCH    JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   and Diamondrock Hospitality Co    NYSE DRH   Low Price to Sales Stocks with Strong Winning ProspectsWhen considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth  Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers

 The Havana competition was one of the most over subscribed competitions that I ve been a part of   Foxx said in an interview before the plane took off   I think that speaks to the interest on the part of the American people  and it also speaks to the level of commercial interest in the U S  that exists  ",2016-08-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/first-u.s.-cuba-scheduled-flight-in-decades-set-to-depart-423271,423271

179744,401260,JBLU,Southwest Airlines  LUV  Stock Declines 22  YTD  Here s Why,opinion,"Shares of Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV   have lost 22 2  so far this year  underperforming its  s decline of 11 1  

 
Why the Lackluster Price Performance 
Southwest Airlines has faced multiple headwinds this year  In April  a passenger on its flight  1380  died due to the mid air engine explosion  This incident adversely impacted travel demand at Southwest Airlines  resulting in soft bookings 
Moreover  Southwest Airlines  like its fellow airline operators Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL   and JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU    has been hit hard by the rise in oil prices 
This low cost carrier issued a lackluster view for second quarter unit revenues due to weak bookings and rising fuel costs  The company expects operating revenue per available seat mile  RASM  to decline around 3  year over year  the earlier guidance had called for a decline in the 1 3  range  
With fuel prices on the rise  the Dallas based carrier trimmed its capacity  measured in available seat mile or ASMs  growth view   It now anticipates second quarter capacity to increase approximately 3 5   Earlier  the company had called for 3 5 4  growth in the metric 
Additionally  the company projects ASM in the low 4  range compared with its prior forecast in the low 5  range  Also  for the latter half of the year  ASM is anticipated to expand approximately 6  year over year  lower than its earlier view of a rise in the low 7  range 
Other Unfavorable Readings
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter and full year 2018 earnings moved south 14 7  and 9   respectively  in the last 60 days  This reflects investor s pessimism surrounding the stock  
Furthermore  the stock has a  of C  which highlights its unattractiveness  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores 
Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score 
Undoubtedly  the above negatives substantiate the company s Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell

179760,401276,JBLU,Load Factors Drop In April  What s In Store For Airlines ,opinion,"Load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers  is an important indicator of profitability and efficiency for airline companies  Higher load factor implies the company is more profitable  This is because a high load factor means that the heavy fixed costs of airlines can be spread across more passengers Load Factors Deteriorate in AprilThis key metric declined in April for major US carriers  namely United Continental Holdings  Inc  s   NYSE UAL   wholly owned subsidiary  United Airlines  Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV    Alaska Air Group  Inc    NYSE ALK    Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   and Hawaiian Holdings  Inc  s   NASDAQ HA   unit  Hawaiian Airlines  Fall in load factor indicates inefficient capacity utilization inducing vacant seats Each of these stocks except Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  You can see  Load factor at Alaska Air Group fell 230 basis points  bps  as capacity expansion  8 7   outpaced traffic growth  5 8    The same decreased 150 bps  10 bps  80 bps and 20 bps at Southwest Airlines  Hawaiian Airlines  United Airlines and Delta  respectively Capacity over growth due to contraction in load factor often causes lower airfares  thereby eroding revenues and profitability of the airline companies  In fact  air fares in the United States decreased in April per data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Per the report  ticket prices reduced 2 7  on a month to month basis  registering the sharpest fall in four years Apart from declining load factors  let s have a look at the other headwinds plaguing the airlines Fuel CostsFuel costs have been on the rise lately due to various reasons such as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East  Oil prices increased 5 6  in April  President Donald Trump s decision to withdraw from a nuclear deal with OPEC member Iran has further spiked oil prices Currently oil prices are hovering at around  71 a barrel  As expenses on fuel comprise a significant portion of airlines  operating expenses  rise in the metric inflates costs  thereby limiting bottom line growth In fact  high fuel costs hurt American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL   results substantially in the first quarter  resulting in the stock losing value post the earnings report  despite outperforming on the bottom line front  Such exorbitant costs are expected to hamper results in the coming quarters as well  Moreover  the company trimmed its current year earnings guidance mainly due to high fuel costs Southwest Airlines  bottom line in the second quarter is also likely to be affected on the same ground  Economic fuel costs are projected at  2 20 per gallon  much higher than the year ago figure  Also  at JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU    fuel cost is anticipated to be  2 23  way above  1 61 reported a year ago Labor CostsWith labor deals very much in vogue in the airline space  such costs are also on an upswing  The airline employees claim that despite the airlines generating record profits  they lag in terms of employee remuneration  This has in turn propelled frequent new labor deals across the airline industry Moreover  per International Air Transport Association  IATA  forecast  labor cost will comprise the major portion of airline expense this year  Labor costs are predicted to account for 30 9  of total expenses in the year compared with   of fuel costs  Most recently  JetBlue reached an agreement in principle with its pilots  Final ratification of the agreement by the pilots is still pending  The airline currently estimates non fuel unit costs between 2  and 4  in the second quarter  The measure is likely to go up following ratification of the new contract  Earlier in March  Spirit Airlines  Inc  ratified its five year deal with pilots  pertaining to wage increase In Flight GlitchesThe airlines have also grabbed headlines of late due to several unpleasant cases on board  Southwest Airlines made maximum headlines in this regard  A tragic incident in April sparked large scale dissatisfaction among customers with the carrier having made an emergency landing at the Philadelphia International Airport due to an engine failure  which resulted in a passenger s death with  others sustaining injuries Southwest Airlines has been struggling with low bookings ever since this fatal incident  In fact  the carrier issued a bearish view on unit revenues for the second quarter  thanks to the same reason  It expects revenue per available seat mile  RASM  a key measure of unit revenue  to decline between 1  and 3   Similar occurrences took place this May as well  Earlier in the month  the carrier made an abrupt landing when one of its    Further adding to the woes  another Southwest Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing only a few days ago due to a   throwing the passengers in a tizzy In April  a CBS News report titled  60 Minutes  leveled allegations against Allegiant Travel Company that the company is afflicted with a large number of mechanical problems  The report  aired on Apr 15  further stated that the poor safety standard was responsible for around 100 serious mechanical events in the January 2016 October 2017 time frame  The charges are being investigated United Airlines also kicked up a controversy  resulting in the tragic death of a black French bulldog puppy on one of its flights in March These untoward incidents have been dampening the airline companies  reputation and certainly do not bode well for the sector participants Price PerformanceThe  fared poorly due to the headwinds  massively underperforming the broader market on a year to date basis  The S P 500 index gained 2 1  against the industry s decline of 12 9  

ConclusionDespite an air of prevalent pessimism revolving around airline stocks  we expect the companies to make a turnaround soon  buoyed by strong demand for air travel and rising air fares  With soaring oil prices  the carriers will most likely pass on the high cost burden to passengers  pockets  Notably  during first quarter 2018 earnings release  American Airlines CEO Doug Parker warned of dearer ticket prices Thriving U S  economy augurs well for travel focused stocks like airlines  With consumer confidence remaining strong  more and more Americans are resorting to vacations  Demand for air travel is expected to remain robust  courtesy of a much enhanced job market and an increasing disposable income Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2018-05-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/load-factors-drop-in-april-whats-in-store-for-airlines-200316772,200316772

  NASDAQ AAL   and JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU   Industry  Airlines  Part 1Link  Airline stocks are unlikely to grab major headlines in the first quarter 2018 reporting cycle  which will see reports from many sector participants in the coming days  High fuel costs are likely to limit bottom line growth in the reporting cycle  Moreover  multiple flight cancellations due to foul weather is also likely to weigh on results In fact  high fuel costs have hurt the results of the two carriers   Delta Air Lines  Inc  and United Continental Holdings  Inc    who have reported thus far  For example  fuel costs increased approximately 20  at Delta  Moreover  the winter storms hurt results to the tune of  44 million at this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Atlanta  GA based carrier  You can see the

prices do not bode well for companies in the airline space as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures Given the inversely proportional relation between oil prices and airline stocks  this increase in crude prices is expected to hurt results for the carriers who are still to report their first quarter numbers In fact  fuel prices are likely to be on uptrend this year  The International Air Transport Association   IATA   projects that jet fuel prices will escalate to around 12 5  to  73 8 per barrel in 2018  The fuel bill is likely to account for 20 5  of total costs in 2018  18 8  in 2017   Apart from high fuel costs  expenses on the labor front and capacity related woes represent further challenges for sector participants Zacks Industry Rank Supports Ongoing StrugglesThe Zacks Industry Rank  177  of 250 plus groups  carried by the  highlights the fact that airlines are certainly not in favor  as far as investors are concerned  This unfavorable rank places the companies within the bottom 31  slot of the Zacks industries We classify our entire 250 plus industries into two groups  the top half  i e  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the

All Brickbats  Some Roses TooDespite the above mentioned headwinds  there are some factors that are favorable for sector participants  The unit revenue scenario is steadily improving  which is a huge positive for the sector  Riding on the improved scenario  the likes of American Airlines Group Inc  and JetBlue Airways Corp  have issued bullish unit revenue views for the first quarter What is more encouraging is the fact that the bright scenario with respect to this key metric is unlikely to fade soon  For example  Delta expects total unit revenues  excluding refinery sales  to increase in the 3 5  range in the second quarter of 2018  Furthermore  rising fuel costs might lead to a rise in ticket prices and boost revenues Strong demand for air travel also bodes well the sector  For example  Airlines for America   A4A     a premier trade organization   for U S  carriers unveiled an upbeat forecast for the current spring season  Per the projection  airline companies are expected to profit considerably this spring  Mar 1 Apr 30  as travel demand is anticipated to increase 4  year over year Moreover  the new tax law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  is a positive for airlines and should boost

In fact  high fuel costs have emerged as a major headwind for airlines in Q1 and the trend is likely to continue for the remainder of the season  Expenses pertaining to fuel represent one of the major input costs for airlines  Naturally  the rise in fuel costs does not bode well for stocks in this space

179801,401317,JBLU,U S  airlines see third quarter profits rise   upbeat outlook  ,news,"By Jeffrey Dastin  Reuters    American Airlines Group  O AAL   United Airlines  N UAL  and other carriers reported strong third quarter profits on Thursday  helped by falling fuel costs  and mostly shrugged off concerns that Ebola could affect their outlook 
Despite concerns about increased competition in some markets  several major U S  carriers also signaled they would boost capacity  betting on a steady increase in passenger traffic through next year 
American  which exited bankruptcy last year via a merger with U S  Airways  saw a nearly 4 percent gain in its shares as it forecast healthy unit revenues for the current quarter  United  while projecting a more moderate unit revenue increase compared to last year  reported that third quarter profit more than doubled 
 The general theme is that the revenue environment seems to be healthy still  demand remains strong and airlines still have pricing power   said S P Capital IQ analyst Jim Corridore  noting that airlines industry wide raised one way fares by  2 last week 
American Airlines  already the world s largest airline by passenger traffic  promised in an earnings call to outstrip its competitors by the end of 2015 as the carrier with  industry leading  profit margins before tax 
While the Fort Worth based carrier acknowledged a temporary drop in bookings the day after congressional hearings on the Ebola virus  it expects passenger revenue per available seat mile to grow by 2 to 4 percent in the current quarter  excluding the impact of cash being trapped in Venezuela  which has hurt U S  airlines that operated there 
Other airlines also downplayed Ebola threat s impact on bookings 
ADDITIONAL ROWS
American said it earned  1 66 per diluted share without special items   beating Wall Street s expectations   and net income of  942 million in the third quarter  a nearly 87 percent improvement on the combined incomes of American and U S  Airways before they merged in December 2013 
American expects its capacity to grow between 2 and 3 percent in 2015  while United anticipated growth of 1 5 to 2 5 percent  Those figures are not directly comparable because the airlines forecast capacity in different ways  The forecasts parallel Delta s  which last week promised a roughly 2 percent growth in capacity next year 
A large portion of the increase will come from the airlines fitting additional rows in their planes flying domestic routes without sacrificing legroom 
 At this point we don t think they re growing too fast   Corridore said 
Investors were somewhat less enthused about Southwest Airlines  N LUV   Its stock fell 2 8 percent after the carrier declined to detail its forecast  Fellow low cost carrier JetBlue also failed to wow investors after reporting earnings that missed analysts  forecasts 
While Southwest Airlines topped analyst estimates  the carrier disappointed with vague guidance on the current quarter  for which it described bookings as  good  
Southwest s 2 percent unit revenue growth in October was a  slow    start   JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said in a research note  Baker said the potential for Southwest to beat fourth quarter targets was  largely dashed given what many consider discouraging revenue commentary  
United  the No  3 U S  airline  grew its third quarter profit nearly 144 percent to  924 million compared to last year  beating earnings per share estimates as well  The airline also halved the gap between its operating margin and Delta s and said it is on track to cut costs by  500 million in 2014 
 We would all like to close that margin gap as soon as possible   United s Chief Financial Officer John Ralney said on the company s earnings call on Thursday   We don t like our relative place in the industry   that s a fact   and we think that we ve got a lot of opportunity to improve

U S  airline stocks hit a 13 year high this week as they gained momentum from lower oil prices and increased travel spending by Americans in an improving economy 
The company s IPO is the first for a U S  airline since May 2011  when Spirit Airlines Inc went public 
Shares of Virgin America closed  7 above their IPO price of  23 on the Nasdaq on Friday  They touched a high of  31 18 earlier in the session  valuing the company at about  1 35 billion

Branson controls 24 8 percent of the company  while hedge fund Cyrus Capital Partners is the biggest shareholder with a 32 8 percent stake 
The airline  popular among travelers as it offers Wi Fi  comfortable leather seats and mood lighting  has been named the best U S  domestic airline by Cond  Nast Traveler Magazine for the past seven years 
Virgin America  which took to the skies in 2007 just before the financial crisis  earned  10 2 million on revenue of  1 42 billion in 2013  its first ever profitable year 
The airline leases all 53 of its Airbus single aisle planes  which mostly fly long haul within the United States and Mexico  with Los Angeles and San Francisco serving as main hubs 
Cush said the company expected to add 10 planes to its fleet over the next two years

sweeping new rules on Thursday that will significantly ease sanctions on Cuba  opening up the communist ruled island to expanded U S  travel  trade and financial activities  Defying hardline critics in Congress  President Barack Obama made good on his commitment last month to loosen restrictions on dealings with Cuba as part of an historic effort to end decades of hostility  The U S  embargo on Cuba  in place for 54 years  will remain  Only Congress can lift it   But the package of regulations issued by the Treasury and Commerce Departments  which will take effect on Friday  will allow U S  exports of telecommunications  agricultural and construction equipment  permit more travel by Americans to the island and open banking relations  U S  airlines will also be permitted to expand flights to the Caribbean island  beyond the existing chartered flights that connect Cuba and the United States  United Airlines Inc  UALCO UL  said on Thursday it planned to serve Cuba from Houston and Newark  New Jersey  subject to government approvals  Delta Air Lines  N DAL  and JetBlue Airways  O JBLU  said they would look into adding services  Thursday s moves were the first tangible U S  steps to implement economic changes Obama pledged on Dec  17 when he and Cuban President Raul Castro announced plans to restore diplomatic relations between the old Cold War foes   Today s announcement takes us one step closer to replacing out of date policies that were not working  and puts in place a policy that helps promote political and economic freedom for the Cuban people   said U S  Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew  While Castro has welcomed last month s deal  he has made clear that Havana does not intend to abandon single party rule or the state controlled economy  Congressional critics of Obama s shift say that Washington should not be rewarding Cuba  The new regulations will allow Americans to travel to Cuba for any of a dozen specific reasons  including family visits  education and religion  without first obtaining a special license from the U S  government as was previously the case  But general tourism will still be banned  John McAuliff  executive Director of the Fund for Reconciliation and Development  which has organized trips to Cuba  said that apart from Cuban Americans visiting relatives  most other Americans would still be corralled into escorted group tours  Still  U S  travelers will be allowed to bring home small numbers of the Cuban cigars that are highly rated by aficionados  It will also be easier for U S  companies to export mobile phone devices and software as well as to provide Internet services in Cuba  In an expansion of remittances allowed  Americans will now be able to send up to  8 000 to Cuba a year  up from  2 000 previously  and bring  10 000 with them when they travel to the country  They will also be able to use credit and debit cards  In addition  a changed definition of  cash in advance  payments required by Cuban buyers could help businesses  most notably U S  agriculture  gain greater access to Cuban markets  The largest U S  meat processor  Tyson Foods Inc  N TSN   which already does some business with Cuba  hailed the changes   The announcement came after the Obama administration said Cuba had fulfilled its promise to free 53 political prisoners and a week before high level U S  Cuba talks in Havana aimed at normalizing ties  including discussions on when to reopen embassies   SIGNIFICANT STEP  Obama s spokesman  Josh Earnest  called it a  significant step  in delivering on Obama s new Cuba strategy  The president declared last month that decades of trying to force change by isolating the island had not worked  But Republican Senator Marco Rubio  a Cuban American who has been strongly critical of the policy shift  called the announcement  a windfall for the Castro regime that will be used to fund its repression against Cubans  as well as its activities against U S  national interests   While Obama is using executive powers to poke holes in trade barriers  Republicans who control Congress have made clear they will not let him entirely dismantle the embargo  Washington imposed economic sanctions as Fidel Castro steered the island along a socialist path that made it a close ally of the Soviet Union  and severed diplomatic ties with Cuba in 1961  U S  officials made clear the new measures do not mean Cuba is now open for business  stressing that while investments in Cuba s limited array of small businesses are permitted  general investment will still be prohibited  And while telecommunications firms can export devices  U S  companies still have to reach an agreement with the Cuban government  which controls all imports and maintains a firm grip on Internet access  Reaction from the U S  business community  which had pressed the administration to open up Cuban markets  was positive but tempered with caution   The regulations were welcome and they went even farther than was articulated in the president s announcement   said Jake Colvin  vice president at the National Foreign Trade Council   But now it will depend on the reality on the ground in Cuba   There was no immediate official reaction from Havana  but some ordinary Cubans welcomed the changes  
 If more Americans can come here  that means more customers  and this will be good for the economy   said Orlando Veliz  a cook for a private restaurant in Havana ",2015-01-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-takes-first-step-to-ending-cuba-trade-embargo-323625,323625

179821,401337,JBLU,JetBlue Pilots Succeed In Union Vote On Third Try,news,"By    JetBlue Airways Corp  NASDAQ JBLU pilots voted by a wide margin Tuesday to join the Air Line Pilots Association  sending the budget carrier s stock price down on concerns the move would raise its costs 
About 71 percent of the pilots eligible to vote in the month long election backed ALPA  JetBlue has about 2 600 pilots  and 96 percent were eligible to vote 

The vote marked the first successful union drive by a group of workers at JetBlue 
It could lead to higher pay and benefits for workers  and is likely to encourage efforts to organize other workers at JetBlue and other budget airlines  which have enjoyed lower costs and more labor flexibility than mainline carriers 
Jetblue  is going to have to look at themselves as more of a traditional carrier   said Gary Chaisan  a labor professor at Clark University in Worcester  Mass   There will be attempts to organize the rest of the workers  
Shares of JetBlue closed down 1 9 percent to  8 59 Tuesday  although it recovered to  8 67 after hours  The stock plunged as low as  8 45 right after the vote was announced 
JetBlue said it and ALPA would form negotiating committees once the National Mediation Board  which conducted the election  authorizes the union 
JetBlue  founded in 1998  had twice before faced a unionization effort by pilots  but the workers failed to muster enough votes 
The vote comes amid concern that the airline industry faces a shortage of pilots due in part to new federal rules requiring longer pilot rest periods and more hours of flying experience 
It also comes after workers recently rejected an attempt to organize a Volkswagen AG  VOWG p XETRA  plant in Tennessee  and the United Auto Workers union on Monday withdrew a legal challenge over the vote 
JetBlue warned earlier this year costs would rise largely because of an agreement reached with pilots to raise base pay rates by 20 percent  JetBlue said that increase was expected to add  145 million to its costs over the next few years     30 million this year   50 million in 2015 and  65 million in 2016 
JetBlue also said plans to hire more pilots this year in wake of the new U S  rest rules would pressure its costs in 2014 
While union representation opens the door to further gains by the pilots  including higher health care and pension costs  experts said the workers won t want to damage the company and may work with the airline to compromise  ALPA contracts also vary from airline to airline  suggesting any new agreement would not necessarily match those at bigger airlines 
 I don t think ALPA went to all this trouble to put JetBlue out of business   said George Hamlin  an aviation consultant in Fairfax  Va 
 They will try to get improved terms but I doubt that they re promising to get legacy terms

179822,401338,JBLU,JetBlue sees new sleeper seats aiding profit,news," Reuters    JetBlue Airways expects its new sleeper seats for U S  cross country flights to add to profits even as some analysts question whether it will make a meaningful difference to the bottom line 
Deviating from its all coach format  JetBlue now offers fully reclining seats on flights between New York and Los Angeles  The service  called Mint  includes some private suites with doors that close  tapas style food and amenity kits  The seats are located at the front of the plane 
 We think it s going to ramp up pretty quickly to profitability   JetBlue President Robin Hayes said in an interview on Tuesday   We re booking weeks out and almost every flight is going out full and we continue to see that trend into the July timeframe  
The Airbus A321 planes with the service have 16 fully lie flat seats  JetBlue plans the service on flights between New York s John F  Kennedy airport and San Francisco starting Oct  26 
Hayes said JetBlue could expand Mint to other routes over time 
JetBlue launched Mint in response to customers who said they were skipping the carrier on cross country flights because it did not offer premium seating  The seats  which recline to convert into flat beds  are initially priced from  599 to  999 one way  Hayes said the average fare was likely to rise but declined to give a timeframe 
The new seats debut as New York based JetBlue faces pressure to improve revenue and hold down costs  Delta Air Lines and American Airlines Group have also upgraded seating on coast to coast routes 
Shares of JetBlue closed up 1 2 percent on Tuesday at  10 98  just below a year high of  11 12 reached on Monday  JetBlue s stock has risen about 28 percent this year  while Delta and low cost provider Spirit Airlines have seen their shares rise about 46 percent and 39 percent  respectively  year to date 
JetBlue  has a good product  it s just that in a very price sensitive industry they need to figure out how to monetize it better   said Savanthi Syth  an airline analyst with Raymond James  Syth said she expects Mint to add six or seven cents in earnings per share to JetBlue 
 It s not big enough to make a big difference to earnings but we think it will be a positive product   she added 
Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a May 16 note that Mint could be  earnings negative   since one Mint seat takes up space of three coach seats 

Hayes  who was named JetBlue president late last year  said the carrier was working with Datalex PLC on a new Web based merchandising platform to be rolled out in the second half that will enable it to offer in plane products 
 We ve been making a lot of the investments in the last two to three years that allow us to monetize and develop new products and services for customers which will absolutely grow our ancillary revenue stream   Hayes said

179823,401339,JBLU,Spirit Airlines ramp workers vote to join machinists union,news," Reuters    Spirit Airlines Inc  O SAVE  baggage handlers have voted to be represented by the machinists union  joining three other employee groups at the low cost carrier that have bargaining agents 
Of 217 eligible voters  131 voted to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers  according to certified results from the U S  National Mediation Board  which supervised the election that began June 16 and ended on Tuesday  Thirty two of the Spirit Airlines workers voted for no representation 
 While we are disappointed by the results  we fully support our Team Members  right to choose and moving forward we are committed to working with  the machinists union  Spirit Airlines spokesman Paul Berry said in a statement 
The ramp employees work at airports in Fort Lauderdale  Florida  Detroit  Atlantic City  New Jersey  and Myrtle Beach  South Carolina  the machinists union said 
 The days of Spirit management unilaterally dictating wages and working conditions end today   Daniel Krampert  a Spirit ramp agent in Atlantic City  said in a statement provided by the machinists 
The Spirit Airlines election comes as unions mount a push to make new inroads at U S  carriers  particularly low cost airlines  Pilots at JetBlue Airways  O JBLU  voted to join the Air Line Pilots Association in April  the first successful union drive by a worker group at that carrier  Union organizing drives are also under way at carriers such as Virgin America  the U S  carrier in which Richard Branson s Virgin Group has a minority stake 
The machinists union has a flight attendant campaign under way at Delta Air Lines  N DAL   spokesman James Carlson said 
Spirit  based in Miramar  Florida  offers low airfares but charges fees for many other optional services  The carrier had just over 3 600 workers at the end of 2013  59 percent of which were represented by labor unions  Its pilots are members of the Air Line Pilots Association  and flight attendants and dispatchers are represented by the Association of Flight Attendants CWA and the Transport Workers Union  respectively 

Spirit said in its most recent annual report that labor expenses represented about 19 percent of its operating costs in 2013 
Shares of Spirit Airlines fell 1 5 percent to  62 41

179826,401342,JBLU,Nor easter Cripples Airline Operations  What Lies Ahead ,opinion,Airline operations have been disrupted severely over the last couple of days due to the deadly nor easter in the Mid Atlantic and Northeast of United States  Notably  this winter storm has impeded travel plans and caused harassments to passengers  It caused heavy snowfall accompanied by hurricane force winds in excess of 120 kilometers per hour in the affected areas Flight Cancellations at Large Due to the StormWith the storm disrupting normal life  it is of little wonder that travel plans were thrown haywire as major airline operators had to cancel multiple flights  In fact  the severity of the storm can be realized from the fact that approximately 4000 flights were cancelled in the United States by various carriers like American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL    Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   and United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL   since Mar 2  2018 While Delta and United Continental carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   American Airlines has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  The worst scenario was on Friday with carriers in the United States cancelling 3 423 flights while more than 4 000 were delayed  In fact  operations were disrupted severely at hubs like Boston  New York and Philadelphia More Worries Loom Ahead Although the winds have weakened  storm related harassments still linger  thousands of homes in eastern United States are still without power  According to a   coastal areas of Maine  MA  among others might still be affected by floods and extreme high tides To compensate for the harassment of passengers  who had planned to travel in the affected period  most carriers including American Airlines  Delta and JetBlue Airways Corporation   NASDAQ JBLU   are offering various facilities  For example  they can opt for change of flights without incurring any extra cost Some Similar Incidents Weather related issues have hurt airlines previously as well  In January 2018  operations at carriers were disrupted by winter storm Grayson  Last year  back to back hurricanes  Harvey  Irma and Maria  dented airline operations significantly Also  winter storm Stella had crippled airline operations considerably by impeding travel  In 2016  Hurricane Matthew had spelt doom for airlines  causing extensive damage  In fact  such acts of nature hinder the schedules of carriers  thus causing multiple flight cancellations  Other Factors Hurting Airlines Apart from the storm related disruption in operations  airlines have been confronted with a few other challenges Of late  the  between legacy carriers   American Airlines and United Continental   pertaining to gate allocation at Chicago s O Hare International Airport has been grabbing headlines  Both carriers  having major hubs at Chicago s largest airport  are levelling charges against each other  Unless resolved quickly  this issue might snowball into a major crisis Moreover  fears related to capacity overexpansion were re ignited with January traffic reports of most carriers like Alaska Air Group  Inc    NYSE ALK    exhibiting a fall in load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers   The downturn can be attributed to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth We remind investors that shares of United Continental declined significantly in January  even after reporting better than expected results in the fourth quarter on issues related to capacity On the fourth quarter conference call  the company stated that it will continue expanding capacity in a bid to maintain market share at major airport hubs to deal with competition from discount carriers like Spirit Airlines  Inc    NYSE SAVE    For 2018  United Continental s capacity growth is projected between 4  and 6  year over year  The metric is anticipated to increase in 2019 as well as 2020 Furthermore  airfares have declined for three successive months in the United States  Generally  carriers are forced to reduce fares as unit revenues decline in the face of capacity outpacing demand growth  While low air fares seem to be favorable for fliers  it becomes a drag on the company s top line with their profits being hurt In addition to the above challenges  the rise in fuel costs also does not bode well for carriers  Evidently  fourth quarter earnings declined at the likes of Hawaiian Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ HA   on high fuel costs Price PerformanceIn view of the above headwinds  it is of little wonder that the  underperformed the broader market in a year s time  The S P 500 Index has gained 13 7  compared with the industry s rally of 10   The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All  Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right

three months Lets delve deep to unearth the factors responsible for the turnaround Bullish Unit Revenues The improving scenario with respect to unit revenues is a big positive for airlines  For example  Delta Air Lines  while revealing better than expected results in the fourth quarter of 2017  predicted total unit revenues  excluding refinery sales   a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier  to increase in the band of 2 5  to 4 5   on a year over year basis  in the first quarter of 2018 Delta expects to perform well on this front in 2018 as well  with passenger revenue per available seat miles  PRASM  growth estimated in each quarter  Delta carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  in the first quarter of 2018 to increase in the range of 2 4  year over year   Furthermore  rising fuel costs might lead to a rise in ticket prices and boost revenues  New Tax Law Likely to Aid AirlinesOn Dec 22  2017  President Trump signed the much anticipated tax bill into law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   Under the  1 5 trillion tax overhaul package  corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21  from 35   The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow  which in turn will aid the bottom lines of carriers Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate  the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States In fact  some market watchers believe that the tax cut would benefit low cost carriers like Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways more than the legacy carriers  This is because the likes of Delta had emerged from bankruptcy a few years ago  Consequently  they are utilizing past losses to avoid paying cash income taxes  so they do not stand to benefit immediately  tangibly  by the tax cuts  However  their smaller rivals are immediate gainers from the tax cuts as they had been paying higher taxes Naturally  low cost carriers like Alaska Air  Southwest Airlines and JetBlue have declared bonuses   1 000 per member  following the tax overhaul  Among legacy carriers  American Airlines has declared a bonus However  all types of airlines  low cost or legacy  invest significantly in capital expenditures  In the new tax scenario  these companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately  which was not allowed earlier  As a result  their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions For example  Delta  which expects revenues in 2018 to increase between 4  and 6  on a year over year basis  lifted its earnings per share guidance  anticipating the new tax law to boost its results  The company now expects earnings per share in the range of  6 35 to  6 70  previous outlook   5 35 to  5 70  More Shareholder Friendly Activities LikelyCourtesy their financial prosperity  airlines have been consistently rewarding their shareholders  For example  United Continental Holdings and JetBlue announced new buyback programs late last year  Alaska Air announced an increase in its quarterly dividend payout  while unveiling its fourth quarter 2017 results  Moreover  the likes of Delta and Southwest also hiked their quarterly dividend payouts last year We expect an uptick in these shareholder friendly activities from carriers following the new tax law  Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills  more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases among others Bullish IATA Forecast for 2018In December 2017  the International Air Transport Association   IATA   provided an encouraging outlook for the global airline industry  IATA predicts global net profit of  38 4 billion for the industry in 2018  This is much higher than the profitability forecast of  34 5 billion for the current year  The bright projection can be attributed to strong demand for air travel Global net profit margin is expected to improve marginally to 4 7  in 2018 from 4 6  estimated in 2017  The top line is projected at  824 billion in 2018 compared with  754 billion expected for 2017 Optimism surrounding the air cargo business has also improved  Cargo revenues are forecast to increase to  59 2 billion in 2018  estimated revenues for 2017 are  54 5 billion   According to the forecast  air travel growth of 6  is expected for 2018  The estimated figure for 2018 is above the average growth of 5 5  in the last 10 20 years Improving Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 81 carried by the 24 member  also highlights the fact that its stocks are back in favor  Notably  a favorable rank places the industry in the top 32  of the 250  groups enlisted  The bullish stance on the industry is further augmented by the fact there were 12 positive estimate revisions in the fourth quarter of 2017 Also  the Zacks Industry Rank has improved immensely  given the industry s 200  rank only a few months ago We put our entire 250 plus industries into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Click here to know more  Valuation Signals More UpsideGoing by the EV to EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  and amortization  ratio  which is often used to value airline stocks  given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses  the industry doesn t look expensive at this point The industry currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 6 5  which compares favorably with the market at large  as the current EV EBITDA for the S P 500 is at 12 7  The industry s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside Some Headwinds RemainDespite the air of optimism surrounding the airline space  there are few headwinds of which one must be mindful  The constant rise in fuel prices  currently hovering around the  65 a barrel mark  do not bode well for airlines as fuel costs represent one of the largest input costs for airline companies IATA projects that jet fuel prices will escalate to around 12 5  to  73 8 per barrel in 2018  The fuel bill is likely to account for 20 5  of total costs in 2018  18 8  in 2017   High labor costs are also hurting the bottom lines of carriers as they are constantly inking deals with various labor groups  courtesy their financial prosperity With their financial status likely to improve further mainly due to the savings from the new tax law  such deals are likely to continue pushing up labor costs  Moreover  glitches like the scheduling error at American Airlines  also have the potential to disrupt operations of carriers Furthermore  natural calamities like the recent winter storm Grayson cause significant revenue losses to airlines leading to multiple flight cancellations  Moreover  issues related to passenger dissatisfaction have been hurting U S  carriers for quite some time Capacity related fears gripped airline investors in the recent past  particularly in 2015   The fears were re ignited  when United Continental  while releasing fourth quarter results on Jan 23  stated that it expects 2018 capacity growth between 4  and 6  year over year  Moreover  similar growth in the metric is forecast in 2019 and 2020 as well  Following the guidance  investors fear that similar actions might be taken by rivals  triggering a price war Bottom LineThe above write up suggests that despite a few headwinds  the overall sentiment is positive surrounding airlines  The introduction of the new tax law makes us believe that good things are in store for airlines in 2018  Given the significant reduction in taxes we expect the already cheap airline stocks to fly higher  going forward The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020

Natural Calamities Hurt Airlines SignificantlyThis is not the first time that the sector participants have been laid low by a winter storm  Earlier  such acts of nature have thrown the schedules of carriers out of gear  causing multiple flight cancellations The back to back hurricanes  Harvey  Irma and Maria  dented airline operations significantly  hurting results in the third quarter of 2017  Prior to that  winter storm Stella had crippled airline operations considerably by impeding travel  In 2016  Hurricane Matthew had spelt doom for airlines  causing extensive damage  
Will Grayson Dampen Airlines Recovery The emergence of Grayson comes at a time when things are looking up for airline stocks after being laid low for most part of 2017  Moreover  the new tax law is expected to be a godsend for airlines The bullish scenario is reflected in the fact that the  has outperformed the S P 500 Index over the last three months  The industry has rallied 8 7  compared with the S P 500 s 6 8  gain in the same period

179865,401381,JBLU,Is JetBlue Airways A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put JetBlue Airways Corporation   NASDAQ JBLU   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  JetBlue Airways has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  JetBlue Airways  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months 
Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that JetBlue Airways has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for JetBlue Airways stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  JetBlue Airways has a P S ratio of about 1 1  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  JBLU is roughly in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  JetBlue Airways currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes JetBlue Airways a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though JetBlue Airways might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of B  This gives JBLU a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been favorable  The current quarter has seen seven estimates go higher in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen six up and one down  in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 13 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched upper by 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below JetBlue Airways Corporation Price and Consensus   The stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineJetBlue Airways is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a solid industry rank  among Top 29  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence on the stock  However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks Editor in Chief Goes   All In   on This Stock Full disclosure  Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other  He believes in its short term profit potential and also in its prospects to more than double by 2019  Today he reveals and explains his surprising move in a new Special Report ",2018-01-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-jetblue-airways-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200279948,200279948

The bullish forecasts were revealed by the companies while disclosing their respective November traffic numbers  While load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers  increased at Southwest Airlines  the metric declined at JetBlue Airways as capacity expansion was surpassed by traffic growth at the Long Island City  New York based carrier  United Continental also announced an additional buyback program

   American Airlines Group  Inc    NASDAQ AAL   and United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL   topping earnings estimates  However  earnings decreased on a year over year basis due to higher costs  At Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines  the bottom line declined 7 6  and 5 4   respectively  while at United Continental  the metric decreased 28 6   American Airlines too reported a significant reduction in earnings in the quarter  The hurricanes have significantly disrupted operations of the airlines  The multiple flight cancellations as well as continued soft demand for air travel to and

pertaining to fuel and labor have been hurting the bottom line growth of airline stocks for quite some time now  Further  adding to the woes  Harvey contributed to an increase in oil prices  Higher fuel prices are expected to limit the earnings growth of the carriers in the fourth quarter as well  Also  with most carriers inking multiple labor deals  such costs have been on a rise of late  In fact this downside has been denting the earnings picture for the airlines over the past few quarters and the fourth quarter is likely to be no exception Bearish Q4 and Full Year View Several airline

Costs  Hurricanes Hurt Airlines in Q3  The Road AheadThe third quarter earnings have drawn to a close for the airline companies  Notably  most carriers have managed to surpass estimates in the reported period  despite back to back natural calamities  primarily owing to reduced expectations However  the broader scenario does not seem so bright for the companies with earnings having declined massively on a year over year basis Q3 ResultsThe third quarter of 2017 saw major airline companies like Delta Air Lines  Inc   Southwest Airlines Co   American Airlines Group  Inc   and United Continental Holdings  Inc   topping earnings estimates However  earnings decreased on a year over year basis due to higher costs  At Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines  the bottom line declined 7 6  and 5 4   respectively  while at United Continental  the metric decreased 28 6   American Airlines too reported a significant reduction in earnings in the quarter The hurricanes have significantly

to weather related disturbances  reported a 3 7  fall in PRASM  You can see  High Costs Hitting AirlinesPersistent high costs pertaining to fuel and labor have been hurting the bottom line growth of airline stocks for quite some time now Further  adding to the woes  Harvey contributed to an increase in oil prices  Higher fuel prices are expected to limit the earnings growth of the carriers in the fourth quarter as well Also  with most carriers inking multiple labor deals  such costs have been on a rise of late  In fact this downside has been denting the earnings picture for the airlines over the past few quarters and the fourth quarter is likely to be no exception Bearish Q4 and Full Year View Several airline companies have provided a grim outlook for the final quarter of 2017 as well as

179914,401430,JBLU,Will Airline Stocks Take Off On Upbeat Thanksgiving Travel ,opinion,Stocks in the airline space faced multiple challenges in the first three quarters of 2017  The space was hit by disruptions from back to back hurricanes  the devastating earthquake in Mexico and high costs Evidently  the had underperformed the S P 500 Index in the first nine months of the current year  While the S P 500 index gained 11 9   the industry rallied 8 8  Turbulent Q3 for AirlinesThe third quarter of 2017 was a huge victim of the difficulties facing airlines  However  major companies like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV    American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   and United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   reported better than expected earnings per share in the quarter  The outperformance with respect to the bottom line can be mainly attributed to reduced expectations All the above mentioned companies carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see Earnings per share  however  decreased on a year over year basis due to higher costs  While the bottom line fell 7 6  and 5 4  at Delta and Southwest Airlines  respectively  at United Continental the metric was down 28 6   American Airlines too reported a significant reduction in earnings in the quarter Also  multiple flight cancellations as well as continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to the recent natural calamities hurt third quarter results  For example  United Continental s pre tax income was hurt to the tune of approximately  185 million Brighter Q4 Awaits Airlines The worst seems to be over for airline stocks as its operations are back to normal  This is evident from Delta s bullish view for the final quarter of 2017 particularly on passenger revenues per available seat miles  PRASM  a key measure for unit revenues   In fact  this airline behemoth expects the metric to increase in the band of 2  to 4   on a year over year basis  in the same period  The projection compares favorably with the 1 9  increase in PRASM recorded in the third quarter At American Airlines  total revenue per available seat miles  TRASM  improved only 1 1  in the third quarter of 2017  However  the fourth quarter TRASM view is much brighter  The metric is expected to increase between 2 5  and 4 5  in the final quarter of 2017 Based on the bullish views  we expect airlines to perform better in the final quarter compared with the turbulent third quarter  Notably  strong demand for air travel backed by cheap ticket prices are expected to support the sector participants Will Airlines Stocks Fly High on Thanksgiving Holiday Period The resurgence of the key players in the airline space is evident from the bullish outlook provided by the Airlines for America   A4A   in the ongoing Thanksgiving holiday period  Nov 17 Nov 28  Per the guidance  approximately 28 5 million passengers are expected to avail the U S  airlines  services in the current holiday period this year  up 3  year over year  The forecast translates into 2 38 million fliers per day during the period  which is an increase of 69 000 from the comparable figure last year Passenger volumes  on a daily basis  is projected to be in the range of 1 61 million to 2 88 million  The bullish forecast was primarily owing to cheap ticket prices  Consequently  the carriers had to add more seats to meet the surge in demand Factors Supporting Turnaround in the Airlines SpaceAn improving economy  a much improved job market and rising disposable income have been a blessing for the sector participants  Also  consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations Despite the recent rally  oil prices are still hovering around the  58 a barrel  a long way off the highs of mid 2014 when the commodity had traded in excess of  100 a barrel  As fuel costs represent one of the largest input costs for airline companies  the lower the oil prices  the better it is for sector participants  In fact  lower oil prices imply greater financial well being for airlines by virtue of massive savings Moreover  a hike in dividend payouts this year by Southwest Airlines and Delta Air reflects financial prosperity in the airline space  In addition  Hawaiian Holdings    NASDAQ HA   recent decision to reward shareholders with dividend payments is indicative of strong financial health Impressive Stock Price performance so far in Q4Shares of JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU    Delta and American Airlines are up 7 1   3 9  and 2 2   respectively  on a quarter to date basis  This reflects that things are looking up for airlines Also  the Zacks Airline industry has outperformed the S P 500 Index on a quarter to date basis  While the industry rallied 4 5   the S P 500 Index has gained 3 6  in the same period Improving Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Industry rank of 87 carried by the 26 member Zacks Airline Industry also highlights the fact that airline stocks are back in favor  The favorable rank places the industry in the top 34  of the 250  groups enlisted  The bullish stance on the industry is further augmented by the fact there have been 12 positive estimate revisions in the fourth quarter of 2017 The improving scenario for the airline space can be well gauged from the fact that the Zacks Industry Rank has improved immensely  given the industry s 200  rank only a few months ago  Valuation Signals More UpsideGoing by the EV to EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  and amortization  ratio  which is often used to value airline stocks  given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses  the industry doesn t look expensive at this point  The industry currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 8 1  which is favorable compared to what the industry saw in the last year  The ratio is below the high end of 8 5 during the period Additionally  the reading compares favorably with the market at large  as the current EV EBITDA for the S P 500 is at 11 3  The industry s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating

179927,401443,JBLU,Strong Spirit Airlines Guidance Lifts Airline Stocks,opinion,"Shares of Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   surged on Tuesday after the company announced in a SEC filing that it raised its third quarter revenue per available seat mile guidance 
The low cost airliner now expects to experience a roughly 6 5  year over year decline in RASM in its third quarter  instead of Spirit s previously projected guidance of a roughly 7  to 8 5  drop off 
Spirit upped its guidance for the highly important metric in its 8 K filing yesterday based in part on improved  ticket and non ticket yields and better than expected load factor  
Spirit offered up its previous RASM projection of up to an 8 5  decline in September amid concerns that the wave of hurricanes would hurt the airline more than it now expects 
The company s adjusted cost per available seat mile without accounting for the cost of fuel is projected to be flat or fall only marginally  compared to its previous estimate of up to a 3  decline 
Still  Hurricanes Harvey  Irma  and Maria greatly impacted Spirit  The storms forced the airline to cancel over 1 650 flights  which cost Spirit about  40 million  In September alone  Spirit canceled approximately 1 400 flights  Yet September revenue passenger miles jumped by 5 9  based on an 8 9  gain in overall capacity  In its third quarter  the company announced that it raised total available seat miles by 18  
This updated projection  coupled with a big increase in overall capacity  helped send shares of Spirit up over 8  on Tuesday morning  The company s stock price has slipped back a bit since then and now hovers around 5  higher  
Even with today s gains Spirit stock sits roughly 42  below its 52 week high of  60 40 per share  The company is set to report its third quarter results Tuesday  Oct  24 
Other Airlines 
Spirit s updated quarterly guidance helped lift other airline stocks as well  The renewed faith that the massive tropical storms and hurricanes might not have impacted airlines as much as previously expected has seen JetBlue   NASDAQ JBLU   stock gain 0 50   while United   NYSE UAL   popped just over 0 50  as well 
Shares of Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA   gained over 2 70   while Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   saw much more marginal gains  Shares of the US Global Jets ETF   KL JETS   climbed slightly

179928,401444,JBLU,United  UAL  Shares Plummet  Airline Stocks Follow ,opinion,"Shares of United   NYSE UAL   sunk over 11  on Thursday after the airline announced it will continue to expand its flying capacity amid a rise in overall operating expenses 
United  one of the largest U S  airline companies  reported third quarter earnings and revenues that beat expectations on Wednesday in the face of the recent series of tropical storms and hurricanes that forced the company to cancel thousands of flights  also read    
United canceled 8 300 flights due to Hurricanes Harvey  Irma  and Maria  which cost the company an estimated  185 million and helped lead to a 0 4  decline in revenues  On top of that  the company s earnings plummeted 29 6   while net income sunk 34  
Tropical storms clearly damaged the Chicago based airline giant s bottom line  But what has investors worried isn t the wave of hurricanes  it s the increased competition that has forced the airline company s costs to rise 
United s operating expenses climbed 6  to  8 8 billion in the third quarter  while consolidated unit cost per available seat mile rose 3   The company cited higher labor expenses and fuel costs as a reason for the big jump in these costs 
The company s passenger revenues per available seat mile also fell well over 3   And United now projects its unit revenues will sink between 1  and 3  in its fourth quarter 
Consequently  United will reportedly bump up capacity   in order to maintain its market share at major airport hubs 
The move comes amid shrinking profits as low cost airlines  such as Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE    drive down ticket costs and lure passengers away from larger  more expensive carriers 
Investors now fear that United will have a harder time boosting its bottom line as it spends more to fight off the new wave of competition  Shares of United fell on Wednesday and now rest about 28  below their 52 week high  United is currently a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Other Airlines 
United s struggle to increase profits amid greater competition caused turbulence throughout the U S  airline industry where even its new  low cost opponents sunk on Thursday as the fight for passengers heats up 
Shares of Spirit tanked over 3 70   while fellow budget minded carriers JetBlue   NASDAQ JBLU   and Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   saw their stock prices dip marginally  Big U S  airline companies Delta   NYSE DAL   and American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL   sank 1  and 2   respectively  The US Global Jets ETF   KL JETS   suffered a 1 30  decline

Apart from the above carriers  the likes of JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU   and Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV   also cut their respective unit revenue views for the third quarter  American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   expects TRASM to grow at a slower pace in the third quarter due to difficult year over year comparisons 
High Labor Costs
Steep labor costs have been hitting the airline stocks for quite some time now  In fact  the future scenario also seems dull and the metric is expected to affect the third quarter results as well

179961,401477,JBLU,We Looked Into Hurricane Harvey Effects  Here s What We Found,opinion,"Unless you ve been away from a TV  computer or smartphone for the past week  you ve likely seen scores of pictures and videos of the unprecedented devastation that Hurricane Harvey has brought to South Texas and Louisiana  As a Texan by way of Canada  I d like to take a moment to reflect on the human and economic impact of this storm  one of the worst natural disasters to strike the U S  in recorded history 
Below are some key data points and estimates that help contextualize the severity of Harvey and its aftermath 
 503 Billion In a previous Frank Talk   I shared that the Lone Star State would be the 12th largest economy in the world if it were its own country which it initially was before joining the Union in 1845  Following California  it s the second largest economy in the U S 
A huge contributor to the state economy is the Houston Woodlands Sugar Land area  which had a gross domestic product  GDP  of  503 billion in 2015  according to the  Not only does this make it the fourth largest metropolitan area by GDP in the U S   but its economy is equivalent to that of Sweden  which had a GDP of  511 billion in 2016 

1 in 1 000 Years The amount of rain that was dumped on parts of Southeast Texas set a new record of 51 88 inches  breaking the former record of 48 inches set in 1978  But now we believe it exceeds that of any other flood event in the continental U S   That s according to a new analysis by the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies and Dr  Shane Hubbard  a researcher with the University of Wisconsin Madison  Hubbard s conclusion required the use of statistical metrics since rainfall and flood data go back only 100 years or so  but the visual below might help give you a better idea of just how rare and exceptional Harvey really is 

 190 Billion According to one estimate  Hurricane Harvey could end up being the costliest natural disaster in U S  history  Analysts with Risk Management Solutions  RMS  believe economic losses  with a majority of the losses due to uninsured property  This is a conservative estimate compared to AccuWeather  which sees costs  or the combined dollar amounts of Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy  If so  this would represent a negative 1 percent impact on the nation s economy 
500 000 Cars and Trucks The wind and rains damaged more than just houses  schools  refineries and factories  According to Cox Automotive  which controls Kelley Blue Book  Autotrader com and other automotive businesses  as many as  could have been rendered inoperable because of the flooding  That figure s double the number of vehicles that were destroyed during Hurricane Sandy in 2012  What this means  of course  is that auto dealerships are going to have their work cut out for them once the waters recede and insurers start cutting some checks  Buyers can likely expect to see a huge premium on used cars 
24  Most people know that Texas is oil country  What they might not know is that it s also the nation s number one gasoline producing state  accounting for nearly a quarter of U S  output  as of August  In addition  the Lone Star State leads the nation in wind powered generation capacity  natural gas production and lignite coal production  according to the 
600 000 Barrels a Day The largest oil refinery in the U S  belongs to Motiva Enterprises  wholly controlled by Saudi Aramco  the biggest energy company in the world  Located in Port Arthur  about 110 miles east of Houston  Motiva is capable of refining up to 603 000 barrels of crude a day  As floodwaters gradually filled the facility  the decision was made last Wednesday to shut it down completely  and as of Friday morning  there was no official timetable as to when operations might begin again  according to  The consequences will likely reverberate throughout the energy sector for some time 
Motiva isn t the only refinery that was affected  of course  As much as  has either been taken offline or reduced dramatically because of Harvey  according to CNBC  The Houston area alone  known as the energy capital of the world  is capable of refining about 2 7 million barrels of crude a day  or 14 percent of the nation s capacity 
 2 50 a Gallon As of last Friday morning  gas prices in Texas had surged to  2 33 a gallon on average  more than a two year high  according to  In the Dallas Ft  Worth area  prices at some pumps are reportedly near  5 a gallon  By Monday  prices had spiked even more  to  2 50 a gallon 
With concerns that a gas shortage might hit the state  panicked Texas consumers lined up outside numerous stations  sometimes for miles  to drain them dry  By 5 00 on Thursday  the 7 Eleven next door to U S  Global headquarters was serving diesel only 
54 Million Passengers The Houston Airport System is one of the busiest in the world  with the total number of passengers enplaned and deplaned  as of April 2017  Flights at the city s two largest airports  Bush Intercontinental and Hobby  were suspended Sunday  September 27  with more than 900 passengers stranded between the two  Commercial traffic resumed on Wednesday  though service was limited  According to Bloomberg  United Airlines  NYSE UAL   which has a major hub at Bush Intercontinental  was 

The International Business Times reports that several major airlines are  in exchange for donations to Hurricane Harvey disaster relief  American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL   for example  will  donated to the American Red Cross after a minimum  25 contribution  Other carriers have similar programs  including United  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  and JetBlue Airways  NASDAQ JBLU  
The Kindness of Strangers For all the talk of economic impact and barrels of oil  it s important we keep in mind that Hurricane Harvey has had real consequences on individuals  families and businesses  Many of them have lost everything 
I might not have been born in the U S   but I ve always been moved and inspired by how selflessly Americans rally together and rush to each other s aid in times of dire need 
This  of course  is one of those times  and I urge everyone reading this to consider donating to a reputable charity of your choice  For our part  U S  Global Investors will be donating money  food  clothing and other necessities to one of our favorite local charities  the 
Please keep the people of South Texas and Louisiana in your thoughts and prayers

179978,401494,JBLU,Is JetBlue Airways Corporation  JBLU  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put JetBlue Airways Corporation   NASDAQ JBLU   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  JetBlue Airways has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 82  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 85  If we focus on the long term PE trend  JetBlue Airways  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 10 84  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that JetBlue Airways has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 41  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for JetBlue Airways stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  JetBlue Airways has a P S ratio of about 1 04  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 13 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years    suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  JetBlue Airways currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes JetBlue Airways a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though JetBlue Airways might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A  This gives JBLU a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates going higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen seven upward and one downward movements in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has grown by 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below JetBlue Airways Corporation Price and Consensus   Despite this positive trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near termBottom LineJetBlue Airways is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 13   bolsters its growth potential  In fact  over the past one year  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait

180004,401520,JBLU,Why JetBlue  JBLU  Is Poised To Beat Earnings This Quarter,opinion,"JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   is a low fare  low cost passenger airline  which provides high quality customer service  primarily on point to point routes  and is based in New York s John F  Kennedy International Airport  More importantly  the company will release its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday  July 25 
JetBlue currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   and the company has surpassed its earnings estimates in nine out of its past ten operational quarters  including a beat last quarter of 4 17   JetBlue also operates within our Transportation Airline industry  which currently ranks in the top 2  of the Zacks Industry Rank 
Investors should possess a sense of optimism in the stock when considering its consistency in beating earnings  its Earnings ESP of 5 46   and its strong Zacks Rank 
If that s not enough  here are three other reasons why you should be optimistic about JetBlue ahead of its report date 
1        Strong Style Scores
JetBlue sports impressive style scores  including  A  grades for Value and Momentum  as well as a  B  grade for Growth  For the Value category  JetBlue possesses some impressive metrics that assisted in driving the company to a strong grade  For instance  the company holds an EV EBITDA of 4 60 and debt equity of 0 29  both of which compare favorably to the industry averages of 6 17 and 0 69  respectively 
As for growth  the company features current cash flow growth of 12 72  and a net margin of 9 61   both of which defeat the industry averages of 6 09  and 6 14   respectively  Finally  JetBlue earned a strong momentum grade due to recent share price movement  In fact  the company s share price has increased by a whopping 34 08  over its past year of operation 
2        Impressive Expansion Goals
In May 2017  the company issued an optimistic report on revenue per available seat mile  RASM  for the second quarter of 2017  JetBlue projects RASM to grow at a rate near 4 6   Also  the carrier said that the future outlook on RASM for the third quarter has been greatly improved since the beginning of the year 
Further  JetBlue is focused on strengthening its presence in major cities and operating at least 70 premium services flights by the end of 2017  The carrier has continued to make an effort to modernize its planes and expand its popular services 
3        Spectacular Growth in Earnings and Revenue
We expect JetBlue s growth to continue  as our Zacks Consensus Estimate projects sales of  1 81 billion  which would constitute year over year growth of 10 45   Also  our Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings calls for EPS of  0 55  which represents 4 19  year over year growth  Additionally  in the past 60 days  six out of seven analysts covering the stock increased their earnings estimates for JetBlue  which would benefit the future financial outlook of the security

180011,401527,JBLU,Airline Stocks Flying High On Multiple Tailwinds  4 Picks,opinion,Stocks in the airline space are having a good time and are certainly back in favor  despite some challenges  Lets us delve deep to find out the factors behind the change in fortunes of airline stocks Improvement in Unit RevenueIssues like unit revenue woes which had plagued airlines in the previous year seem to be a thing of the past   This is because the scenario regarding this key metric   a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier   has been improving steadily In fact  carriers like American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU   have unveiled bullish unit revenue forecasts for the second quarter of 2017  JetBlue has also said that the scenario for revenue per available seat miles  RASM  a key measure of unit revenue  is expected to vastly improve for the third quarter as well In addition  JetBlue received encouraging news lately when Moody s Investors Service  the rating services arm of Moody s Corp   upgraded the Corporate Family Rating for the carrier to  Ba1  from  Ba3   The firm is impressed by the carrier s strong balance sheet and efforts to deepen focus on its popular Mint service among other factors Impressive Balance SheetsMoreover  the fact that airlines are in solid financial health can be made out from their employee as well as investor friendly moves  To this end  Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   and Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   have hiked their quarterly dividend payouts this year  Moreover  they have also shelled out significant amounts to their employees as part of their respective profit sharing schemes Additionally  the robust financial health of most domestic carriers has prompted them to invest substantially in improving the flying experience for travelers  in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space Fall in Oil Prices  A Boon for CarriersThe recent decline in oil prices bring in further good news for airlines as fuel costs represent a significant portion of their operating expenses  Currently  oil price is hovering around the  40 a barrel mark which represents a significant decline from the levels at the start of the year In fact  crude has lost over 20  on a year to date basis  It is to be noted that lower the oil prices better it is for the carriers  bottom line  Therefore  a sharp decline in oil prices implies that stocks in the airline space will continue to make huge savings thereby bolstering their balance sheets Bullish IATA ForecastAt its 73rd Annual General Meeting in Cancun  Mexico  the International Air Transport Association  IATA  said that airline companies are expected to be more profitable in 2017 than previously expected  IATA now expects global net profit for the industry to come in at  31 4 billion  the earlier projection hinted at profits of  29 8 billion for 2017  The improved projection was driven by expectations of higher demand  While air travel is expected to grow 7 4  on a year over year basis  cargo demand is projected to grow 7 5  in 2017 Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Favorable ScenarioThe positive developments are reflected by the bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 59 carried by the 25 member  industry Notably  thefavorable rank places the industry in the top 23  of the 250  groups that are enlisted  The positioning indicates a positive outlook  In fact  our back testing shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Airline Stocks that Should Grace Your PortfolioGiven this bullish backdrop  it seems to be a prudent idea to add stocks from this high flying sector to one s portfolio for high returns  However  with a plethora of stocks present in the airline space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to pinpoint potential outperformers  This is where the Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy

180013,401529,JBLU,Southwest Airlines To Terminate Service In 2 Cuban Cities ,opinion,"The Dallas  based low cost carrier Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   became the latest US carrier to reduce its services to Cuba  The carrier has decided not to fly to Varadero and Santa Clara from Sep 5 as the routes had ceased to be viable The  announced by President Trump earlier this month might also have played a part in Southwest s decision  The new policy  which prohibits individual travel to the island nation  might hurt the already weak travel demand to Cuba further  Thus  the revenues of American carriers operating in Cuba are likely to shrink Even though Southwest has decided to end its operations to two Cuban cities  it will continue its Havana service  The company operates nonstop flights to the Cuban capital from Ft  Lauderdale  twice daily  and Tampa  once daily  now It is to be noted that not only will those flights remain in operation but the carrier has also sought permission from the U S  Department of Transportation to start a third roundtrip  on a daily basis  connecting Ft Lauderdale and Havana  Demand on the Havana routes is much stronger than in the smaller Cuban cities  Currently  Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see the Southwest Airlines Company Price
    We remind investors that the resumption of scheduled commercial flights to Cuba from the U S  last year after a gap of more than five decades was greeted warmly by American carriers  In Jun 2016  the U S  Department of Transportation authorized six U S  based carriers to operate scheduled flights to nine second tier Cuban cities  Approval to fly to Havana came two months later However  a few months after commencement of the service the above enthusiasm started declining  This was because travel demand to Cuba fell short of expectations  Consequently  the likes of American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and JetBlue Airways Corporation   NASDAQ JBLU   trimmed their services to the nation  Also  lower than expected demand caused the likes of Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   to terminate their flights to Cuba Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies                                                                                                       It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively                                                                                          And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2017-06-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/southwest-airlines-to-terminate-service-in-2-cuban-cities-200198293,200198293

180032,401548,JBLU,Airlines In March  Less Punctual And More Complaints,opinion,"The month of March was not a very good one for fliers as far as punctuality is concerned  In fact  the Air Travel Consumer Report unveiled by the U S  Department of Transportation also suggests that most U S  carriers were less punctual in reaching their destinations in Mar 2017  both on a year over year and month on month basis  Notably  the picture was gloomy for the month with respect to cancellation rates as well 
Punctuality Statistics
According to the report  79 9  flights operated by U S  carriers touched down on time  This represents a marked deterioration from the comparable figures of 81 5  and 82 6  recorded in Mar 2016 and Feb 2017  respectively Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   secured the top spot with 86 9  of its flights arriving on time during March  It was followed by Hawaiian Airlines  which is owned by Hawaiian Holdings Inc    NASDAQ HA    United Airlines  whose parent company is United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   and American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   as the next three companies to record on time arrival rates of 84 7   81  and 80 2   respectively  A total of twelve carriers were considered in the report 
We note that the Atlanta  GA based Delta had secured the top position in Feb 2017 too  with an on time arrival rate of 89 5   Delta was followed by American Airlines with 85 2  of its flights arriving on time in the same month 
Disappointing Performers
According to the report  Virgin America  acquired by Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK    emerged as the least punctual U S  airline with only 65 5  of its flights arriving on time during the month  In fact  its brand name is likely to disappear in 2019 Low cost carrier JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   was the second from below recording an on time arrival rate of 70 8   Florida based low cost carrier  Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   occupied the third lowest spot  recording on time arrival rate of 75  
 Cancellations Rise but Complaints Fall 
The findings also showed that the number of cancellations increased during Mar 2017  The rate of cancelled scheduled domestic flights increased to 1 8   comparing unfavourably to the figures of 1  and 1 5  in Mar 2016 and Feb 2017  respectively  In fact  Hawaiian Airlines emerged as the topper with respect to this metric with only 0 3  of its flights being cancelled in the same month 
JetBlue Airways was the worst performer in this respect with 3 9  of its flights cancelled during the month  Moreover  the report stated that none of the domestic or international flights had tarmac delays exceeding the permitted duration of three hours and four hours  respectively 
But the brighter aspect of the report came with respect to the significant month on month decrease in the number of consumer complaints about airline service filed with the government  Evidently  in Mar 2017  1 132 complaints were filed  which represents a 20 7  decrease over the preceding month  Spirit Airlines was the worst performer in this respect  while ExpressJet topped the list with the lowest complaint rate 
Bumping Rate Flat
According to the report  the bumping  passengers denied boarding  rate was flat at 0 62 per 1000 passengers in the first quarter of 2017  January to March  on a year over year basis  We note that the issue has been inviting attention lately  courtesy the forced evacuation of a passenger from a United Airlines Flight on Apr 9 
Apart from United Continental  the likes of American Airlines and Spirit Airlines also grabbed headlines due to unfavourable customer  related issues 
Price Performance
The above incidents  which have not been captured in the report  have been responsible for airline stocks struggling of late  This is further exemplified by the chart below which shows that shares of the legacy carriers  Delta  American Airlines and United Continental have lagged the Zacks categorized  industry over the last three months 
While shares of Delta and American Airlines have lost 3 2  and 1 2  in the period  respectively  the United Continental stock gained 4 4   Meanwhile  the industry gained 13  over the last three months

180033,401549,JBLU,Should Value Investors Pick JetBlue Airways  JBLU  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put JetBlue Airways Corporation   NASDAQ JBLU   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  JetBlue Airways has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 44  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 89  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts JetBlue Airways  current PE ratio below its midpoint  which is 16 48  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Transportation sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 09  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that JetBlue Airways has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 41  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for JetBlue Airways stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  JetBlue Airways has a P S ratio of about 1 09  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 08 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is considerably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  JetBlue Airways currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes JBLU a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 32  which is slighlty better than the industry average of 5 10  Clearly  JBLU is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though JetBlue Airways might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  C   This gives JBLU a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen seven upward revisions and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by about 6 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 5 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below JetBlue Airways Corporation Price and Consensus    The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  JetBlue Airways is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor Bottom LineJetBlue Airways is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  despite a decent industry rank  top 21  out of more than 250 industries   a Zacks Rank  3  makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  However  over the past one year  the Zacks Transportation   Airline sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick Zacks  2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks  radar  Imagine being in the first wave of investors to jump on a company with almost unlimited growth potential  This Special

180034,401550,JBLU,Will New Cuba Travel Policy Hurt U S  Airlines ,opinion,"On Jun 16  President Trump announced some changes to current U S  policy on Cuba  which were put into action by his predecessor Barack Obama  The new policy is in line with Trump s promise during the campaigning phase  In fact  Trump had  tweeted in November last year that he might terminate the deal  inked by Obama  in the event of Cuba not doing enough for its people 
Even though  he did not scrap the entire deal  the President announced certain changes in inline with his  America First  principle  Moving ahead  the new administration aims to restrict the flow of US money flowing into the oppressive Cuban military regime  Also  the new policy is dedicated to betterment of the Cuban people by pressurizing the island s government to broaden the private sector and reduce the military s interference in every profitable unit of the country 
In fact  to keep the Cuban military at bay  the President s policy aims to do away with travel directed toward benefitting the military  intelligence or security services of the island nation  Under the new restrictions  travel to Cuba on an individual basis would not be allowed  Even though individual travel has been banned  group travel is allowed 
A Brief Flashback
In 2014  President Obama had called for the restoration of diplomatic ties with Cuba after more than 50 years  As part of that process  travel restrictions were eased  Subsequently  many U S  airlines started operating commercial scheduled flights to Cuba 
In Jun 2016  the U S  Department of Transportation authorized six U S  based carriers to operate scheduled flights to nine second tier Cuban cities  The first scheduled commercial flight to Cuba from the U S  was operated by JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   
JetBlue Airways carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Notably  the approval to fly to Havana came two months later in August  The Havana routes were highly in demand among the US carriers as they collectively applied for the approval to operate nearly 60 flights to Havana on a daily basis  The erstwhile agreement with Obama allowed for only 20 daily roundtrip flights between the nations 
Would Individual Travel Ban Hurt Airlines   
Currently  the likes of American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    JetBlue Airways  Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   and Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK   operate scheduled commercial flights to Cuba  But following the revised order on Cuba  the carriers have adopted a wait and watch policy regarding their operations to the nation 
Airline heavyweights like Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have  said that while their existing operations to the nation would continue  they would abide by any changes that might take place following the announcement of the new policy 
We note that the travel demand to Cuba had fallen short of expectations  Consequently  the likes of American Airlines trimmed their services to the nation  Lower than expected demand also caused the likes of Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   and Frontier Airlines to terminate flights to the nation  Despite this factor  the new policy to ban individual travel is likely to hurt the top line of the US carriers operating in the country to some extent 
In fact  a recent Reuters report had suggested that cruise operators and airlines in the US could lose approximately  in revenues on an annual basis  if Obama s policy was entirely reversed  While the entire policy has not been consigned to flames by the new US government  the prohibition on individual travel to the country might still shrink the revenues of carriers  through lower travel demand  operating in Cuba  a popular tourist destination 
However  only time will tell the extent to which revenues are actually hurt  Consequently  we expect investor focus to remain on the issue  going forward Transportation   Airline Industry 5YR   Return

Is JETS a Really Buy Candidate 
By now  it is clear that the beat ratios that the corporate strength in the airlines industry is moderate  However  oil prices play a crucial role in the airlines  cost structure  If oil prices manage to see an uptrend in the coming days on the extension of the OPEC output curb deal  airlines may suffer on profit margins  read    
However  United Continental Holdings Inc  was backed by one of its major shareholders and American Airlines dropped hints that it is gaining more control over its fares  as per   This was actually what pushed up the fund in recent trading sessions 
If this was not enough  Warren Buffett s  recently indicated that it made sizable investments in American Airlines and Southwest Airlines  benefiting the sector  read    
Nevertheless  investors having a strong stomach for oil related risks and overall moderate earnings  may target the airline industry in the ETF form  Otherwise  the backdrop is risky for airlines investing  Below we highlight the fund in detail 
JETS in Focus

180073,401589,JBLU,Are Airline Stocks Ready To Take Off ,opinion,"The airline industry has historically been a turbulent one to invest in  And it makes sense  High capital costs and rarely making significant money tends to make investors jump ship at the slightest hint of bad news and jump along for the ride on any good news from airline stocks 
So while you can t remove the turbulence from the industry  you can lessen it by investing in the best positioned airline stocks  This post is going to walk you through the 3 airline stocks that are most likely to make you some money and not be so turbulent that you need to call a flight attendant 
3 Airline Stocks To Buy
 1  JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ JBLU 
When you think of airline stocks  you probably think of the big players first  But don t overlook little JetBlue  The company has been quietly gaining momentum and is in the process of cleaning up past mistakes 
What past mistakes you might ask  The biggest issue JetBlue faces is one it created  It simply was too aggressive in its growth plans  As a result  revenue per available seat mile fell by 5   The pain carries over to the first quarter of 2017 where revenue per available seat mile is expected to decline another 5  
But JetBlue is correcting its mistake  They are slowing expansion in 2017  They also announced a cost cutting initiative to achieve an annual structural cost savings by 2020 of  250  300 million 
Finally  the airline is adding more premium seat flights  The Mint routes  which are cross country routes that offer flat  bedlike premium seating  will expand to more cities in 2017  Many travelers rave about these seats  so while demand is there  JetBlue should be able to add to the bottom line by offering more premium seats and more routes in 2017 
In all  JetBlue is well positioned for the short term and the long term  As they slowly continue to expand operations  you can bet JetBlue will become a household name like the other major airlines 
 2  Ryanair Holdings PLC  NASDAQ RYAAY 
Unless you have been to Europe  you probably are not aware of Ryan Air  They are the discount airline of Europe and they are a great company to invest in 
Starting with the financials  the company s debt to equity ratio is much lower than the industry standard  sitting at 105  and revenue has climbed each of the past 5 years  They are also slowing expanding East into more European markets where they have not had a footprint in previous years  This slow methodical growth will help the bottom line while not negatively impacting revenue per available seat mile 
The only negative to Ryan Air is Brexit  The stock took a slight hit when the Brexit vote was announced  but the stock price has come back as investors know this is a good stock to own long term 
Increasing revenues will be a challenge as there remains pressure on the Pound  but once the currency rebounds  the sky is the limit for Ryan Air 
 3  Alaska Air Group Inc  NYSE ALK 
Alaska Airlines made headlines when it   Many investors were skeptical about the purchase  but long term  it makes sense  First  it helps Alaska Air diversify from their main hub in Seattle  And second  with the airline able to squeeze as much profit as it can  currently over 20   it will do the same for the Virgin brand as well  As it stands now  Virgin s profitability is just over 11  
Higher profitability means a higher stock price and more hubs allows the airline to avoid having to drastically cut airline ticket prices to compete with other airlines 
In addition to the merged synergies  by the end of 2017  the airline will have replaced its remaining outdated 737 s with new larger  and more fuel efficient models  The carrier will end up with nearly 25  more seating capacity  This will only increase revenues more as Alaska Air has been able to increase capacity in recent years 
The stock price for Alaska Air has been on a steady rise but with its recent stall  now is a great time to get in on this company before the stock price shoots higher 
Final Thoughts
As mentioned at the beginning of this post  airline stocks are volatile by nature  But as with anything you invest in  you can weed away some risk by investing smartly  By investing in strong  healthy airlines  you can take some of this volatility out of the picture 
Of course  there is still the chance of the unexpected happening  but these stocks will be able to rebound from any unforeseen issues they may face

180074,401590,JBLU,United To Report Earnings Amid Public Relations Disaster,opinion,"United Continental Holdings Inc  NYSE UAL  Industrials   Airlines   Reports April 17th  After Market Closes
Key Takeaways 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  0 38 and  8 35 billion in revenue  with EPS 1 cent above Wall Street  and  13 billion behind the WS estimate in revenue 
United s two viral public relations incidents will unlikely hurt financial prosperity for investors 
Steadily rising fuel costs and higher labor compensation are risks to secure high margin flights 
What are you expecting for UAL 

Airline earnings season officially kicked off with Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL  reporting this past Wednesday with better than expected earnings growth  Estimize and Wall Street were in line with EPS expectations of  0 74  with Delta beating both by 3 cents  This week  all eyes are on United Airlines  earnings report as two controversial events have caused backlashes 
It started last month when teenage girls traveling under company benefit rewards were not permitted to board an aircraft because the leggings they were wearing did not meet dress code  and then just last week another passenger on a United aircraft was forcibly removed from the plane  after refusing to be re accommodated to a later flight 
According to United s recent investor update  the March close in traffic was  better than expected   This suggests that United could beat consensus expectations for a fifth straight quarter  The update  which was released on Monday  helped assuage some investor concerns in the aftermath of the public relations fiasco  However  United s PRASM indicator has shown no growth over the past year  which will pose a threat to earnings growth this quarter  United reports operational performance on a monthly basis 
Its most recent reports declared that UAL s March 2017 consolidated traffic  revenue passenger miles  increased 3  and consolidated capacity  average seat miles  increased 3 4  versus March 2016  Additionally  UAL s March 2017 consolidated load factor decreased 0 3 points compared to March 2017  Overall  one can expect United to fall flat as operational performance has not improved significantly 
Some near term risks to another bullish report include currency headwinds  macroeconomic uncertainty and increased competition  According to its operational report  international flight load factor has declined 2 0 points from February  and it has decreased 1 2 points from last year  This is most likely due to a stronger US dollar and unexpected terror attacks in Europe and Asia 
Its domestic load factor has increased slightly by 0 4 points from last year  While United s domestic performance is growing  it will face fierce competition from airlines like JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ JBLU  that strategically targets domestic travelers  Another risk to a high earnings quarter is the rise in labor costs as United has increased compensation for their employees  As a result  higher labor costs can reduce high margin flights  therefore not generating as much profit as expected ",2017-04-18,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/united-to-report-earnings-amid-public-relation-disaster-200183255,200183255

 Our quantitative model too does not show conclusively that JetBlue Airways will beat earnings in the first quarter of 2017  According to our proven model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings surprise  However  that is not the case as highlighted below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for JetBlue Airways is  12 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 3 cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  JetBlue Airways carries a Zacks Rank  3 which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s  12 00  ESP complicates our surprise prediction Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions JetBlue Airways Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
    Factors Likely at PlayWe expect the bottom line in the first quarter to be hurt by higher expenses due to the recent labor deals inked by the company and the spike in fuel costs  Consequently  the carrier expects consolidated operating cost per available seat mile  excluding fuel  to grow in the band of 3  to 5   Fuel price is also projected to rise to  1 73 per gallon in the first quarter from  1 56 recorded in the fourth quarter  Operating revenue per ASM  RASM  is anticipated to decline approximately 4 8  We are  however  impressed by JetBlue Airways  efforts to expand its operations   The company s efforts to attract more passengers should boost the top line in the first quarter  Further  its efforts to reduce debt levels also raise optimism In a bid to meet the surge in demand  the carrier recently announced that it intends to expand its premium service  Mint   Following the move  this low cost carrier intends to operate 70 Mint flights by Dec 31  2017  We expect a further update on the Mint issue on the conference call Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader transportation space may consider American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    Air Lease Corporation   NYSE AL   and C H  Robinson Worldwide   NASDAQ CHRW   as our model shows that these companies possess the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases American Airlines has an Earnings ESP of  7 55  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company will report first quarter results on Apr 27 Air Lease has an Earnings ESP of  1 16  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company will report first quarter results on May 4  You can see  C H  Robinson has an Earnings ESP of  2 50  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company will report first quarter results on Apr 25 Zacks  2017 IPO Watch List Before looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks  radar  Imagine being in the first wave of investors to jump on a company with almost unlimited growth potential  This Special Report gives you the current scoop on 5 that may go public at any time One has driven from 0 to a  68 billion valuation in 8 years  Four others are a little less obvious but already show jaw dropping growth ",2017-04-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jetblue-airways-(jblu)-q1-earnings:-disappointment-in-store-200184091,200184091
180088,401604,JBLU,Will O Hare Airport Strike Impact Thanksgiving Travel ,opinion,"According to a in the Wall Street Journal  on Nov 29  workers  non unionized  at Chicago s O Hare International airport will go on strike in an attempt to raise their wages and secure union rights    around 500 workers at one of the country s busiest airports which include wheelchair attendants  baggage handlers  airplane cabin cleaners and janitors will go on strike on the day as they strive to persuade the authorities for a  15 hour wage  The workers had voted last week in favor of the strike  However  workers like air traffic controllers and security screeners will not be part of the strike 
Even though not unionized  the workers are supported by the Service Employees International Union  SEIU   The labor union represents almost 2 million workers across various fields in the U S  and Canada   According to SEIU  Nov 29 will also see demonstrations and protests at 18 other major airports in the country including Los Angeles International Airport and Newark International Airport 
The concerned workers serve major carriers like American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    We note that United Continental is the largest operator at the airport  followed by American Airlines Group  Other carriers operating at the airport include the likes of Delta Airlines   NYSE DAL   and Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   
Additionally  Nov 29 marks the fourth anniversary of the strikes by fast food workers  The strikes had launched the Fight for  15 campaign 
Strike Timing   A Major Relief
The timing of the impending strike  however  provides relief to the passengers as it is on the last day of the Thanksgiving holiday travel period  According to Airlines for America   A4A    a leading trade group  estimates approximately 27 3 million passengers to opt for air travel in the Thanksgiving holiday period  Nov 18 Nov 29   The projection reflects a 2 5  increase from the 2015 figure 
A4A has predicted that 2 27 million fliers per day will be transported by carriers during the period  representing an increase of 55 000 from the comparable figure last year  Passenger volumes  on a daily basis  is projected to be in the range of 1 51 million to 2 81 million  The busiest day for the holiday period is expected to be Sunday  Nov 27  The lightest travel day is anticipated to be the Thanksgiving Day or Nov 24  2016  With the strike scheduled to take place after the busiest travel day  travel during the Thanksgiving holiday period is unlikely to suffer substantially 
Apparently  Nov 29 was selected for the day of strike so that the travel plans are not jeopardized  The passenger friendly move is likely to garner support from the public as the workers strive to improve their pay and working conditions Transportation   Airline Industry Price Index

Strike Threat Looms at Lufthansa
We note that pay related strikes are not uncommon in the airline space across the world  Germany s Lufthansa   OTC DLAKY   has been facing work disruptions due to frequent strikes for quite some time  The latest update in this regard has come from the carrier s pilots  They are scheduled to go on strike on Nov 23 in a bid to improve their pay 
The strike is likely to hurt short and long haul flights of the carrier which are scheduled for departure from various airports in Germany  Apparently  the carrier has offered pay raises to the tune of 2 5  to its pilots  However  the offer is unacceptable to the pilots  union leading to the breakdown of talks between the parties and the impending strike  Notably  Lufthansa currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
We expect investor focus to remain on these impending strikes and their impact on travel in the coming days 
Improved Financial Health Leads to Pay Hike Demands
With carriers in favorable financial health  courtesy low oil prices  it is natural for workers to ask for higher pay and better working conditions  However  this has resulted in frequent pay related labor deals and associated issues across the airline industry  This has resulted in escalating labor costs which have impacted third quarter earnings for major carriers like American Airlines and JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   
The fourth quarter projections by many carriers for operating expense per available seat mile  CASM    excluding fuel and profit sharing   indicate that the costs are likely to continue rising  For example  JetBlue anticipates the metric to grow in the band of 4 5 6 5   including negative impact to the tune of 0 5  due to Hurricane Mathew   Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   expects CASM   excluding special items and profit sharing   to increase in the band of 4 5  in the final quarter of 2016  which is much more than the 2 6  increase witnessed in the third quarter

Launch Coincides with Cuba Mourning Fidel Castro
The commencement of direct flights to Havana comes at a time when Cuba is mourning the death of its former leader  Fidel Castro  We remind investors that diplomatic ties between the nations were severed by the U S  in 1961 after Fidel Castro overthrew the Cuban government to set up a socialist state and in the process started to establish strong relations with the erstwhile Soviet Union  In late 2014  President Obama called for the restoration of diplomatic ties with the nation after consulting his Cuban counterpart Raul Castro  Fidel Castro s brother  
U S  flights to other Cuban cities are already in operation  following the decision of the U S  Department of Transportation  DOT  to authorize six U S  based carriers to operate scheduled flights to nine second tier Cuban cities  After the announcement in June this year  the first commercial flight to Cuba from the U S  was operated by JetBlue 
Havana Approval
However  the approval to fly to Havana came two months later   in August  The Havana routes were highly in demand among U S  carriers as they collectively applied for the approval to operate nearly 60 flights to Havana on a daily basis  The agreement allowed for only 20 daily roundtrip flights between the nations 
On Aug 31  the U S  DOT granted approval to eight carriers   Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    American Airlines  United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    JetBlue Airways  Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE    Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV    Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK   and Frontier Airlines   to operate direct flights to Havana  American Airlines was the biggest winner as the carrier gained approval to operate 35 weekly flights  All the above mentioned publicly traded carriers carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see    
With American Airlines and JetBlue having already commenced flights to Cuba  the other carriers are expected to follow suit  The top line of carriers should benefit significantly from operations to the new destination as Havana is a favorite tourist spot Transportation   Airline Industry Price Index


The Trump Impact
Despite the optimism surrounding the move  it remains to be seen what stance President elect Donald Trump takes for Cuba  when he assumes office in January 
In fact  a report appearing on the  mentioned that the President elect recently tweeted that he may terminate the deal in the event of Cuba not doing enough for its people  Hence  the U S  carriers are expected to chalk out schemes to ensure that the deal remains intact

180092,401608,JBLU,Why Airline Stocks Were Flying High In Wednesday s Trading,opinion,"Wednesday  Dec  7 brought huge smiles on the faces of investors as the main indexes touched record highs  The S P 500 Index ended the trading session at a record high of 2 241 35  up 1 32   The Dow Jones industrial average also touched an all time high  ending the day at 19 549 62  up 1 55  
Moreover  the Dow Jones Transportation Average   a price weighted average of 20 U S  transportation securities   ended the day 2 54  higher  closing at 9 371 61  The index includes railroads  truckers  marine transportation  delivery services and logistics companies  apart from airlines  Hence  the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index can easily be deemed the true representative of the U S  transportation division 
According to the Dow Theory  the Dow Jones Industrial Average governs the movement of the Dow Jones Transportation Average in normal market conditions  In the event of the industrial average scaling a new high  transports must follow suit 
The Dow Jones Transportation Average Index includes six airline stocks   Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU    Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK   and Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    
With the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index performing exceptionally well  it was no surprise that airlines had a field day  Shares of all the airline companies present in the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index gained on Dec 7  The impressive performance resulted in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining 2 53  to close Wednesday s trading session at  110 79  Additionally  the 33 member U S  Global Jets ETF   KL JETS    which provides exposure to the global airline industry  gained 2 79  on Dec 7  ending the day at  28 41 
Catalysts for the Surge
The encouraging November traffic report unveiled by Dallas based Southwest Airlines was one of the main reasons behind the significant gains posted by airline stocks on Dec7  The carrier s November traffic  measured in terms of revenue passenger miles  increased 7 2   while capacity  available seat miles  expanded 4 9   both on a year over year basis  
Another important metric  load factor   percentage of seats filled by passengers   climbed 180 basis points to 85 1  as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion  Interestingly  this is the highest ever load factor recorded by the carrier in the month of December  Backed by the impressive traffic report  shares of Southwest Airlines ended the trading session on Dec 7  at 49 85  up 4 55   Southwest Airlines still projects that operating revenue per ASM  RASM  a key measure of unit revenue  will decline in the band of 4 5  in the fourth quarter of 2016 
Another favorable development in the airline space in recent times is the proposed takeover of low cost carrier Virgin America by the Seattle  WA based Alaska Air Group  which gained 3 38  on Dec 7  Alaska Air Group intends to close the merger  in the very near future  following the much awaited clearance from the U S  Department of Justice and the subsequent settlement of the consumer lawsuit against the tie up  Successful closure of the deal would result in the creation of the fifth largest airline in the U S   in terms of passenger traffic  
Recent Rebound in Airlines
We note that it was not only on Dec 7  that airline stocks performed well  In fact  stocks in the space have been outperforming over the last couple months despite multiple headwinds  The recent improvement in performance can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks categorized Transportation Airline industry has outpaced the iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund  over the last two months  The ETF  which provides exposure to the broad transportation sector by tracking the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index  has gained 16 65  while the Transportation Airline industry has appreciated 17 54  in the period 

 
It is no secret that airline stocks have been hurt by unit revenue issues for quite some time  However  the circumstances seem to be changing for the better as most carriers are coming out with improved forecasts for RASM in the fourth quarter of 2016  The most recent bullish RASM view came from Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA   
The carrier now expects fourth quarter RASM to grow in the range of 3  to 6   Earlier  the company had anticipated an increase of 0 5  to 3 5   Hawaiian Holdings sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
Also  fears related to overcapacity have been plaguing airline investors for quite some time  However  the bullish capacity related updates recently provided by several carriers are putting to rest such fears  The Thanksgiving travel rush further indicates the strong demand for air travel 
The improving scenario for the airline industry can be further gauged by fact that the current Zacks Industry Rank of 93  among more than 260 groups  for the Transportation Airline division is much more favorable than the 200  rank carried couple of months ago

Industrials   Airlines   Reports January 18  Before Market Opens
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 52 on  8 91 billion in revenue  1 cent below Wall Street on the bottom line but right in line on the top
United Continental recently raised its target PRASM range to down 1 25 1 75  from a decline of 3 to 4 
Steadily rising fuel costs plus macroeconomic uncertainty poses a threat to high margin international flights
Airline earnings season is officially underway and going by Delta s results  other major airlines can expect to hit some turbulence  Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL  announced better than expected revenue for the fourth quarter but fell short of analyst s estimates on the bottom line  Sales figures benefited from lower fuel costs  improving travel trends and greater promotional and discounting campaigns  But discounting also put a damper on margins especially for large airlines which traditionally rely on overpriced flights  Don t be surprised if United falls into a similar trap when it announces fourth quarter results tomorrow morning 
Analysts at Estimize expect United to post  1 52 per share on the bottom line  reflecting a 43  decline from a year  That estimate increased by 14  since the company s most recent report in October  Revenue for the period is expected to decline by 2  to  8 91 billion  marking a significant improvement from previous reports in fiscal 2016  The stock typically does its best in the month following an earnings report  increasing by an average of 4  
Like the other airlines  United reports operational performance on a monthly basis  Its most recent reports declared December 2016 traffic increased by 2 6  on a 2 6  increase in average seat miles  compared to a year earlier  The company also took the time to raise guidance on key PRASM metrics from a decline of 3 4  to 1 25 1 75   The bullish revisions reflect a stronger close in bookings  low fuel costs  and improving traffic trends 
United s promotion activity  especially its member loyalty  continues to play a large role in its recent success  In fact  United was recently deemed to operate the best overall frequent flyer program in the world for a thirteenth straight year 
Some near term risks to another bullish report include currency headwinds  slowly rising fuel costs  macroeconomic uncertainty and increased competition  JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ JBLU   Spirit Airlines Inc  NASDAQ SAVE  and Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  pose a legitimate threat to major airlines market share by offering tickets at more attractive price points  Meanwhile the strength of the U S  dollar and increasing turmoil overseas could hamper performance in international operations ",2017-01-16,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/discount-carriers-hurting-united-airlines-profitability-200172593,200172593

180119,401635,JBLU,Warren Buffet Bets On 4 U S  Carriers  Should You ,opinion,"The tide seems to be turning for the airlines sector as Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  recently bought stakes in four major U S  carriers   Delta Air Lines Inc   NYSE DAL    American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    Southwest Airlines Co   NYSE LUV   and United Continental Holdings Inc    NYSE UAL    The move naturally found favor with investors since Buffett  the founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway  is commonly regarded as one of the greatest  if not the greatest  investors of all time 
According to the Omaha  NE based company s third quarter 13 F filing  Buffet has invested in Delta Air Lines  American Airlines and United Continental  The fact that the iconic investor has also betted on low cost carrier Southwest Airlines was revealed via a  
Unexpected Move
The move has come as a complete surprise since Buffet historically did not favor airline stocks  According to media reports  his last involvement with the airlines sector was way back in the 1980s when he invested in U S  Airways  The experience was anything but sweet and consequently Buffet turned his back on airlines 
He was so disgruntled with the sector that he once said that  it has eaten up capital over the past century like almost no other business   No doubt his move to buy stakes in major U S  airline stocks was completely unexpected and consequently has attracted a lot of attention 
The move is all the more surprising since it comes at a time when carriers are facing multiple headwinds like declining air fare  low demand for travel due to security fears  technological problems and Brexit induced uncertainty to name a few 
Recent Tailwinds
Despite being plagued by headwinds  the third quarter  which recently concluded for airline stocks  did see quite a few airline players including the four in which Buffett has put his money on  reporting better than expected earnings per share   though undoubtedly aided by low expectations 
In fact  carriers like United Continental Holdings  American Airlines  Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK   and SkyWest  Inc    NASDAQ SKYW    have not only topped earnings expectations but have also outperformed in terms of revenues  In fact  SkyWest s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  bears evidence of the improving condition  You can see    The better than expected third quarter performance can be gauged by the 9 2  gain the NYSE ARCA Airline Index over the last one month Industry Price Index
 

Moreover  woes related to unit revenues that have hurt airline stocks for quite some time seem to be easing  American Airlines recently unveiled a bullish outlook on unit revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016  The carrier now expects total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  a key measure of unit revenues  to decline in the band of 0 5  to 2 5  in the fourth quarter  The view represents a marked improvement from the guidance issued last month when the metric was expected to decline in the band of 1 3  
Delta expects to return to positive unit revenue growth early next year  Moreover  RASM at JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   decreased 3 5  in the third quarter  This indicates an improvement from the 8 2  decline in the second quarter 
Also  fears related to overcapacity have been plaguing airline investors for quite some time  However  the bullish capacity related updates recently provided by several carriers are putting to rest such fears  In September  Southwest Airlines announced that it expects 2017 capacity to expand less than 4  on a year over year basis 
The projection compares favorably with the view for 2016  wherein capacity is estimated to increase in the range of 5  to 6   Furthermore  while releasing its third quarter results  Delta said that it expects 2017 capacity to expand merely 1   in line with the projection for the fourth quarter 
Moreover  the current scenario of rising oil prices could turn out to be favorable for airlines  This is because carriers are likely to hike air fares in such a scenario  This will ultimately augment the top line 
Additionally  the approval granted by the U S  Transportation Department to eight U S  carriers  including the four favored by Buffett  is a positive  Once operational  the top line of the concerned carriers should be boosted significantly as Havana is a favorite tourist spot 
The improving scenario for the airline industry can be further gauged by fact that the current Zacks Industry Rank of 161  among more than 260 groups  for the Transportation Airline division is much more favorable than the 200  rank carried a month ago 
Given the recent improvements  the involvement of one of the most revered investors of all times will undoubtedly usher in better days for the sector  While we expect these developments to rekindle the interest of investors in the aviation space  the picture will become clearer only with the passage of time

180134,401650,JBLU,Airline Stock Roundup  Improved Q3 Unit Revenue Views From United Continental  American Airlines,opinion,"The past week saw airline heavyweights like United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   revealing traffic data for Sep 2016  Apart from the traffic numbers  American Airlines and United Continental grabbed headlines by virtue of their improved views with respect to unit revenues for the third quarter

180142,401658,JBLU,Will Trinity Industries  TRN  Q3 Earnings Disappoint ,opinion,"Trinity Industries Inc    NYSE TRN   is scheduled to release third quarter 2016 results after the market closes on Oct 26 
In the second quarter  the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 37 78   Moreover  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 16 40   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
TRINITY INDS IN Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Factors at Play
The company s third quarter results are expected to be hurt primarily by weak market conditions  In addition  railcar deliveries are anticipated to decline due to weak demand for railcars  We expect the company s third quarter results to suffer from high costs  Adverse foreign currency movement may also hamper the company s top line 
The Rail Group segment  which recorded disastrous results in the second quarter  is expected to continue its poor run in the third quarter as well  Given the gloomy backdrop  the company expects earnings per share for 2016 in the band of 2 00  2 30  well below the year ago figure 
On the brighter side  the company stands to benefit from a favorable financial position  along with moderate levels of debt  Moreover  we are pleased by the company s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments 
 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Trinity is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or at least  3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here  as elaborated below 
Zacks ESP  Trinity Industries has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 52 cents 
Zacks Rank  Trinity carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   As it is  we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider

180157,401673,JBLU,Will The OPEC Call To Cut Production Hurt Airline Stocks ,opinion,"In a notable turn of events  the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC    the international cartel of oil producers   has decided to cut oil output for the first time since 2008  The development is expected to add to the woes of the airline sector  which has already been grappling with multiple macroeconomic headwinds 
The airline sector has already been reeling under a plethora of issues like a surge in terror attacks  Brexit induced uncertainty  unit revenue issues  falling ticket prices and technological glitches  to name a few  The bearish Zacks Industry Rank of 204  out of more than 260 groups  currently carried by the Transportation Airline segment further highlights the gloomy scenario  
OPEC Decision 
At its meeting in Algeria  some of the world s biggest oil producers like Saudi Arabia   agreed to cut production to a range of 32 5 33 million barrels a day from the current level of 33 24 million barrels a day  However  the organization has decided to wait till November to chalk out the details of the scheme 
The decision to curb output to combat the problem of supply naturally led to a surge in crude oil prices  which jumped around 5  to approximately  47 a barrel 
Cheap Oil  Godsend for Carriers
It is a well documented fact that the health of airline stocks is inversely related to oil prices  This is because fuel costs represent one of the most significant expenses for carriers  Oil prices have been declining from the  100 a barrel mark since mid 2014 owing to oversupply of the commodity in the face of lackluster demand 
Cheap oil has aided the bottom lines of carriers immensely by enabling significant savings as their operating expenses have been much lowered  The substantial reduction in oil prices has boosted the financial health of carriers  in turn  supporting these companies to engage in investor friendly activities like dividend payments and share buybacks  In fact  carriers like Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   and Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   have already announced dividend hikes this year 
Banking on their financial stability  these carriers are not only looking to reduce their debt levels but are also sharing more profit with employees  Earlier this year  American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   decided to embrace the profit sharing scheme after opposing it previously  This is a clear indication of the popularity of this employee friendly scheme in this regime of solid financial health for carriers  courtesy of cheap oil 
Apart from the above benefits  cheap oil has helped carriers to deliver impressive earnings performances in the past few quarters  In the second quarter of 2016  carriers like American Airlines Group  Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK    JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU    Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   and Copa Holdings   NYSE CPA   outperformed on the bottom line front owing to cheap oil  We note that Copa Holdings  which sports a Zacks Rank 1  Strong Buy   is a good investment option  You can see  TRANSPORTATION AIRLINE Industry Price Index
 

Will OPEC s Decision Hurt Carriers 
The aforesaid factors clearly suggest that carriers have reaped enormous benefits from cheap oil   In this scenario  OPEC s decision to curb output is unfavorable for the already struggling airline sector as lower production is likely to result in higher crude price  In fact  even before OPEC s decision  oil prices had improved significantly from the 12 year low of around  26 a barrel in February this year  Moreover  given that oil prices have been low for over two years  it has been already priced in 
At a recent conference  Delta Air Lines stated that it believed that the era of high profits due to low fuel costs is behind it  In fact the prospect of a further rise in oil prices  which is a likely scenario in view of the OPEC decision  could be welcomed by carriers 
The scenario of rising fuel costs should provide further scope to raise ticket prices  thereby boosting revenues  Moreover  higher oil prices may help mitigate capacity overexpansion   another long standing problem for carriers  However  only time will reveal the nature and extent of the impact of the OPEC decision on carriers  We expect investors  interested in the airline space  to remain focused on the burning issue going forward

180162,401678,JBLU,Why Is JetBlue Airways  JBLU  A Must Add For Your Portfolio ,opinion,"On Oct 4  2016  we issued an updated research report on JetBlue Airways Corporation   NASDAQ JBLU    The Long Island City  NY based low cost carrier currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   indicating that it will outperform the broader market in the near term 
We are impressed by the renewable jet fuel purchase agreement between JetBlue Airways and SG Preston last month  Under this deal  which is aimed at reducing carbon emissions  JetBlue is expected to purchase over 33 million gallons of blended fuel per year from SG Preston over a period of 10 years  This deal is by far the largest  binding commitment for hydro processed esters and fatty acids  HEFA  based renewable fuel purchase over a long term by an airline company 
We are also impressed by the company s bullish guidance for total revenue per available seat mile  RASM  a key measure of unit revenue  for the third quarter  The carrier expects RASM for the third quarter to decline 3 4  year over year  This marks an improvement from the 8 2  decline in the second quarter 
We are also positive on the U S  DOT s decision to grant final approval to eight carriers  including JetBlue  to initiate commercial flights to Havana  The approval was gained on the same day the first U S  flight landed in Cuba in more than 50 years  The flight from Fort Lauderdale to Santa Clara was operated by JetBlue 
Moreover  the carrier has an impressive history with respect to earnings per share  JetBlue Airways managed to outperform the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters with an average earnings beat of 7 76   We expect the carrier to perform well in the third quarter as well  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has increased by 7 cents to 59 cents per share over the last three months 
In view of the above positives  we believe that JetBlue Airways has significant scope for share price appreciation the near term and hence  advice investors to add the stock to their portfolio 
Other Stocks to Consider
Apart from JetBlue Airways  investors interested in the airlines industry may consider stocks like Ryanair Holdings   NASDAQ RYAAY    GOL Linhas   NYSE GOL   and Copa Holdings   NYSE CPA    While Ryanair and GOL Linhas carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Copa Holdings sports a Zacks Rank 1  Strong Buy   You can see  
The 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate for Copa Holdings has climbed 10 cents to  4 55 per share in the last month 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has climbed 4 cents to  5 99 per share for Ryanair in the last month 
The loss estimate for GOL Linhas has narrowed to 11 cents for the third quarter from a loss of  1 60 expected a month ago

180163,401679,JBLU,Airline Stock Roundup  Delta Air Lines  September PRASM Improves  Alaska Air Group In Focus,opinion,"The past week saw Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   and Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK   revealing their respective September traffic figures  While Alaska Air Group recorded improvement in load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers   the metric declined at Delta Air Lines as the Atlanta  GA based carrier s traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion 
Nevertheless  Delta Air Lines reported improved PRASM performance for September  The report  which was released on Oct 4  caught the attention of investors and led to stock price appreciation 
Dallas based Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   also featured in the news in the past week  albeit for wrong reasons  According to a  report  the carrier s tentative pay related deal with its pilots  inked in Aug 2016  might have hit rough weather as Delta Air Lines has already inked an  agreement in principle  with its pilots that promises higher pay 
On the price front  NYSE ARCA Airline index gained 1 15  in the past week to  91 74 despite oil prices surging after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  announced its decision to cut oil production  OPEC has decided to lower output by as much as 750 000 barrels a day from November to prevent oil prices from falling further 
Interestingly  the lack of reaction in the airline space to the OPEC announcement clearly indicates that oil prices are no longer the primary catalysts governing airline stock price movements  Oil prices have been weak for the last two years  Given the extended period of slump  it has been already priced in Transportation   Airline Industry Price Index

3  Ireland based Ryanair Holdings   NASDAQ RYAAY   reported solid traffic data for the month of September  The upside came on the back of its customer friendly  Always Getting Better  scheme  The carrier s traffic climbed 13  to 10 8 million in the month  Load factor rose to 95  from 94  a year ago  However  the budget carrier said that it expects average air fares in the six month period leading to Mar 2017 to fall in the band of 10 12  
Moreover  according to a Bloomberg  mentioned that the carrier does not expect traffic to the U K  to grow despite the continued weakness in the country s currency  pound  compared with the U S  dollar  The carrier s Chief Executive Officer  stated last month that Ryanair s profits are expected to be hurt for four years as a consequence of the Brexit vote in June this year 
The Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company saw its share price declining over the past five days  You can see  
4  According to a Bloomberg report  pilots at Delta Air Lines would see their pay increase 30 2  over the next four years if the  agreement in principle  inked last week materializes  However  this agreement is likely to be responsible for Southwest Airlines  tentative deal with its pilots falling through  This is because Southwest Airlines pilots would see their pay increase only 29 4  over four years if the deal progresses    pilots at the low cost carrier are asking for a revised contract 
5  Close on the heels of JetBlue Airways Corporation s   NASDAQ JBLU   renewable fuel deal  American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   too came into focus with an environment friendly update  In a bid to reduce carbon emission  the carrier has retained the services of Ocean Park  a boutique investment bank that has a three decade long track record of substantial contributions toward the development of the bio fuels industry  Ocean Park will assist the Fort Worth  TX based carrier in evaluating alternative jet fuels among other things  Given Ocean Park s vast experience in the field  the move is a prudent one from American Airlines

180204,401720,JBLU,July Airfares Pocket Friendly  Cheap Oil Prompts Sharp Fall,opinion,Stocks in the airline space are being challenged by a wide number of headwinds in the form of the surge in terror attacks  prevailing uncertainty following the Brexit vote  and unit revenue related issues to name a few  Moreover  the fall in average airfares in the U S  for Jul 2016 was the sharpest in over a year  according to data released by the Bureau of Transportation Services Airfares declined 4 6   on an unadjusted basis  from the comparable figure in Jul 2015  Moreover  the reading on airfares for the month showed a 8 5  decline compared to Jun 2016  The sharp drop in airfares is primarily due to soft oil prices  Apart from cheap oil  capacity related woes  which have been affecting airline companies for quite some time  are also being cited for the substantial slump in July airfares  Even though  the low air fares spell good news for fliers  declining air fares are likely to hurt the top line of airline companies  thereby affecting profits Oversupply Concerns Led to Sharp Fall in July Oil PricesOil prices fell sharply in July  nearly 15  according to a Reuters and this scenario is being mentioned as the primary reason behind the significant fall in air fares in the month  Currently  oil prices are hovering around  45 a barrel  Although  this displays resurgence from the 12 year low of around  26 per barrel hit in February this year  it is nowhere near the  100  a barrel mark witnessed in mid 2014 With oil prices not expected to be very high in the near term  it comes as no surprise that research firm Hopper believes that airfares will continue to drop through October  Average fare per round trip is projected to come down over 8  from current levels to  213 in October According to our  report  the transportation sector of which airlines are part of  saw its top line shrink by 1 4  in the second quarter of 2016  This is worse than the 0 9  top line deceleration witnessed in the first quarter of 2016  With carriers already struggling to post significant revenue growth  low airfares mean further concerns for their top lines Unit Revenue Woes Continue to HurtCarriers have been suffering owing to unit revenue issues for quite some time and despite efforts to bring about some improvement on that front  these woes are expected to hurt carriers going ahead  Lower fuel surcharges on international flights due to weak oil prices have hurt the top line of carriers  This is exhibited by the declining key revenue metric   passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier  The PRASM related issues are not a thing of the past and are evident from the 7  drop in the metric at Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   in July  The sharp drop was due to foreign exchange woes along with the ongoing supply demand imbalance in the Transatlantic and softness pertaining to domestic yield  American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   expects total revenue per available seat mile  RASM  a measure of unit revenue  decline in the band of 3  to 5  for the third quarterUnited Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   anticipates its consolidated passenger unit revenue to decline in the third quarter in the band of 5 5  to 7 5   Low cost carrier Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   estimates RASM to decline in the range of 3 5  to 4 5  in the third quarter as compared to the earlier projected range of a decline of 3 0  to 4 0   Unit revenue issues have impacted other carriers like JetBlue Airways Corporation   NASDAQ JBLU   also  RASM at JetBlue fell approximately 2 5  in July  Alaska Air Group  Inc   NYSE ALK    which is expected to acquire Virgin America   NASDAQ VA    by year end  witnessed a 7 7  PRASM decline in the second quarter The above commentary clearly indicates that unit revenue issues are far from over for carriers and such headwinds will continue to hurt the top line of carriers going ahead  With airline stocks already stressed  the July reading on airfares imply further woes for the carriers on the top line front  The bearish Zacks Industry rank of 239 carried by the Transport  Airline group further highlights the struggles of carriers Falling Airfares  Encouraging Labor Day ForecastThe sharp fall in air fares prompted by weak oil prices is an encouraging piece of news for fliers  This is evident from the bullish Labor Day forecast by Airlines for America  According to the organization  approximately 15 6 million passengers are expected to be transported through U S  airlines during

180205,401721,JBLU,4 Top Value Stocks In The Transportation Sector Right Now,opinion,"It is well documented that the transportation sector is experiencing a rough phase at the moment  The sector is widely diversified ranging from airline companies to truckers  shippers to railroads  to name a few  Issues like the surge in terror attacks  Brexit vote uncertainty  declining coal shipments and labor problems are affecting stocks in the space  big time 
The headwinds are primarily responsible for the sector s unfavorable performance in the second quarter of 2016 compared with the first quarter   According to our latest  report  total earnings per share for the S P 500 transportation players decelerated in double digits  12 4   year over year in the second quarter  In the first quarter the bottom line had expanded 3 3   As per the report  the top line shrunk 1 3  in second quarter whereas in first quarter revenues decelerated 0 9  on a year over year basis 
The dreary picture enveloping the sector is displayed in the bearish Zacks Industry carried by most of its sub groups  For example  the Transportation Airline segment carries a Zacks Industry rank of 241  out of 260  industries  and the Transportation Shipping segment carries a rank of 223 
Sector Not Bereft of Positives
Despite the negatives  the sector did see quite a few key players like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the second quarter  The chief growth driver was cheap oil 
One of the primary benefactors for any transportation company is cheap oil as costs associated with fuel represent one of the main expenses for this sector  Currently  oil is hovering around  45 a barrel  While this represents a strong resurgence from the 12 year low of around  26 a barrel hit in February  the fact remains that the commodity is still trading at levels much lower than those   100  a barrel  witnessed in mid 2014  With oil unlikely to touch the mid 2014 highs any time soon  soft oil prices should continue to benefit transport companies going forward 
The gigantic fall in oil prices has bolstered the bottom lines of transportation stocks resulting in huge savings  thereby cushioning their financial health  This has led to most companies in the space promoting shareholder friendly activities like hiking dividends or announcing new repurchase programs 
Uncertain Scenario Calls for Value Investing
The above write up clearly suggests that a great cloud of uncertainty looms large on the sector  In this volatile scenario  it is advisable for investors interested in the sector to opt for Value stocks that are perceived to be  bargains  or are undervalued

180230,401746,JBLU,After Delta s  DAL  Latest Woes  Are Airline Stocks Worth Consideration ,opinion,"Delta Air Lines    NYSE DAL    continued into Wednesday after the company cancelled 255 more flights  higher than its previous expectation of 90 flights  This comes after 775 cancellations on Tuesday and 1 000 on Monday  Delta had experienced a power outage on Monday  which went on to affect computer systems and thusly the company s global operations 
Southwest Air Lines   NYSE LUV   went through the same situation about three weeks before  when a router failure ultimately resulted in the cancellation of 2 000 flights and delays for another 7 000  In July  United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   also experienced a router issue  which resulted in a two hour delay for all flights globally 
The airline industry is difficult to invest in  since it is exposed to many different macroeconomic factors  and is notably hurt whenever companies experience any kind of service disruption  World renowned investor Warren Buffett once said that  Investors have poured their money into airlines and airline manufacturers for 100 years with terrible results  
Let s take a look at some major airliner s recent performance  and if they might be on track to prove Mr  Buffett wrong 
Delta Air Lines 
Delta Air Lines was down 1 6  in afternoon trading on Wednesday on the aforementioned news 
The company has seen downward earnings estimate revisions for every period in the foreseeable future  Current quarter estimates stand at  1 76 in earnings per share  down from the  1 88 estimate 60 days ago  Current fiscal year estimates stand at  5 92 per share  which is down from the  6 41 estimate 60 days ago 
Although Delta reported better than expected earnings in Q2  it has to deal with currency headwinds and a shift in consumer sentiment due to recent terror attacks  The airline industry sits in the bottom 8  of the Zacks Rank  so I wouldn t expect anything special in the near future DELTA AIR LINES Price and EPS Surprise   Delta currently sits at a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Southwest Air Lines 
Southwest Air Lines has brought its operations back to normal  but shares have not recovered to pre outage levels  As   the company has not yet settled an agreement with its unions  missed Q2 earnings estimates  has outdated technology  and is engaged in ticket pricing wars with fellow discount airliners which are hurting revenues 
The culmination of these concerns along with downward earnings estimate revisions makes it difficult to believe that Southwest is out of the woods  Current quarter estimates stand at  0 93 in earnings per share  down from the  1 09 estimate of 60 days ago  Current fiscal year estimates are down to  3 95 from  4 23 per share SOUTHWEST AIR Price and EPS Surprise   Southwest currently sits at a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
United Continental Holdings
United beat Q2 earnings expectations  but saw a 21 1  and 5 2  respective year over year decline in earnings per share and revenues  However  the company did also buy back  694 million worth of shares  with  255 million remaining under its current program  and approved another  2 billion worth of buybacks 
The company will launch a business traveler focused service  United Polaris  later in the year  These new initiatives reflect increased management confidence in United s outlook  but earnings estimate revisions still serve as some cause for concern 
Current quarter estimates are down to  2 84 per share from the original  2 97 estimate  Fiscal year estimates stand at  7 94  down from the previous  8 27 estimate  Given the company s storied history and potentially new source of revenue  United could still be worth keeping an eye on moving forward UNITED CONT HLD Price and EPS Surprise   United currently sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
JetBlue Airways
Like Southwest  JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   is a discount airliner  operating an average of 800 daily flights and carrying 30 million customers annually  Concerns with the company include increasing maintenance costs due to its use of an older fleet and engines  Along with being subject to the same headwinds as industry peers  JetBlue is also losing revenue on competitive ticket pricing 
However the company did also report increased traffic growth in July  which is a healthy sign  Still  JetBlue has seen multiple downward earnings estimate revisions  Current quarter estimates are down three cents to  0 57  while fiscal year estimates are down 14 cents to  2 14 JETBLUE AIRWAYS Price and EPS Surprise   JetBlue currently sits at a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
American Airlines
American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL   recently made news when it  with 30 000 employees  agreeing to provide them an average pay raise of 22   As we noted with Southwest  union discontent can be a major source of concern for airliners  and this recent news serves to quell that concern for American 
Furthermore  American beat Q2 earnings expectations  posting its 11th consecutive positive surprise  Unlike discount airliners  it has benefited from the oil glut  and expects to save money due to lowered fuel costs  The company also bought back  1 7 billion worth of stock in Q2 and paid out  58 million in dividends 
American is pouring money into new airliners  having retired 31 aircraft in Q2 and investing  1 2 billion towards new aircraft during the quarter  However  like every other airliner  it has seen downward earnings estimate revisions  Current quarter estimates are down 19 cents to  1 54  while fiscal year estimates are down 25 cents to  5 44 AMER AIRLINES Price and EPS Surprise   American currently sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Bottom Line
The airline industry as a whole has fallen on hard times  again  Each company has seen a drop in Passenger Revenue per Available Seat Mile  PRASM   which is a key metric for these companies  Furthermore  a stronger U S  dollar  Brexit  and terror attacks are a few of the many factors that have impacted tourism and spending in general 
Although some companies are working on promising new initiatives  the airline industry has plenty of work ahead  Then again  it always does ",2016-08-10,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/after-delta's-(dal)-latest-woes,-are-airline-stocks-worth-consideration-200147269",200147269

180240,401756,JBLU,US Carriers Sell Off In Wake Of Orlando   Shanghai Attacks,opinion,"Shares of major airlines stocks like Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and JetBlue Airways Corporation   NASDAQ JBLU   nosedived following the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando and an explosion at the Shanghai Pudong airport on Jun 12  With airline stocks plummeting on the twin acts of terror at different ends of the globe  the NYSE ARCA Airline index declined 2 69  to  84 45 on Jun 13 
Orlando Mass Shooting 
In the early hours of Jun 12  an individual by the name Omar Mateen opened fire at a nightclub in Orlando  FL  The indiscriminate act of terror  described as the worst mass shooting in the history of the U S   claimed at least 50 lives and injured around 53  Those dead included the gunman 
Such acts of terrorism impact airline stocks as there is a possibility of waning travel demand due to security fears  The timing of the attacks could not have been worse as the three month period between June and August has been predicted to be the busiest one for U S  carriers in terms of air travel 
According to the forecast released by the Airlines for America   A4A   last month  approximately 231 1 million passengers will supposed to be transported by various U S  carriers during the above mentioned period  This translates into a daily traffic of 2 51 million  up 4  year over year TRANSPORTATION AIRLINE Industry Price Index
Shanghai Airport Explosion 
Another violent act occurred in China on the same day  dampening the spirits of airlines  Four people were apparently injured at Shanghai s Pudong International Airport when a certain Zhou Xingbai threw an explosive laden bottle at a check in counter  Following the incidence  the attacker tried to kill himself as well 
The above explosion highlights the necessity to tighten security at airports  In the wake of the attack  Chinese carriers like China Eastern Airlines Corp  Ltd    NYSE CEA   lost value on Jun 13 
Terror Attacks Spell Doom for Airlines
There have been quite a few acts of terror across the globe over the past few months  Last November  the Paris attacks resulted in multiple casualties and injured many individuals  Shares of carriers like Air France KLM Group were dealt a heavy blow by the act  The Brussels attacks in Mar 2016 also hit stocks in the sector  Furthermore  the  last month resulted in a downward movement for airline stocks 
Following the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels  the U S  State Department issued a global travel alert on May 31 to U S  citizens citing the possibility of more terrorist attacks  The alert has primary been issued as Europe is likely to attract many tourists during the European Soccer Championship currently being held in France and the Catholic Church s World Youth Day scheduled to be held in Poland next month 
Meanwhile  European carrier Ryanair Holdings   NASDAQ RYAAY   recently stated that it expects airfares to face pressure due to the terror attacks which have a direct impact on travel demand in Europe  Moreover  travel company  Thomas Cook revealed a 5  decline in summer bookings last month compared to last year 
The Bottom Line
Even though airline stocks are benefiting immensely from the oil price slump  acts of terrorism continue to hurt stocks in the space  In fact  even the International Air Transport Association  IATA  has stated that it expects passenger travel growth  6 2   in 2016 to be less than that recorded in 2015  7 4   ",2016-06-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-carriers-sell-off-in-wake-of-orlando---shanghai-attacks-200135956,200135956

180243,401759,JBLU,4 U S  Airline Stocks At Risk As UK Opts For Brexit  ,opinion,"Putting all speculation to rest  the Britons have voted in favor of exiting the European Union  Results of the U K  referendum revealed that 51 9  of the votes  17 410 742  were cast in favor of Brexit while 48 1   16 141 242  opposed the notion 
Going into details  53 2   38   51 7  and 44 3  of the participants in England  Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland  respectively  cast their votes in support of leaving the bloc after over four decades  As had been widely expected  the Brexit decision has created ripples throughout the world  rattling the global financial market 
Following Britain s decision to depart  the pound has taken a beating  slumping to its  point in 30 years  Also  the FTSE 100 tanked over 8  immediately after the commencement of trading  The impact has been so severe that Prime Minister David Cameron announced his decision to resign by October  The effects of Brexit are expected to catastrophic as far as British markets are concerned  at least in the short term 
US Markets to Feel the Tremor
In such a scenario  the ripple effects are expected to be felt across the Atlantic  With Britain accounting for 10  of revenues for  S P 500 players  things do not seem to be rosy for US stocks  In fact  firms in the U S  with exposure to Britain are likely to hit badly with the tumbling pound reducing U S  earnings on repatriating the income 
Airlines to Face the Brunt  
The airline sector is already grappling with the effects of the recent terror attacks   the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando and the explosion at the Shanghai Pudong airport  Fears of travel demand waning with such attacks on the rise have caused carriers like American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU   and Alaska Air Group  Inc    NYSE ALK   to trade near at their 52 week lows  Apart from this  airlines are struggling with respect to unit revenues 
The tough times for airlines is exemplified by the NYSE ARCA Airline index declining over 4  since the Orlando shootings  Moreover  the bearish effect on the industry can be gauged from the  from the fact that the  Trans Airline  sector currently has a Zacks Industry Rank  204   placing it in the bottom 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups  The Brexit decision has worsened matters for U S  airlines with exposure to Britain 
In fact  European airlines like British Airways and Ryanair Holdings   NASDAQ RYAAY   might face the brunt with leisure and business travel demand taking a hit  Moreover  Britain  by virtue of its EU membership  has been part of the EU s single aviation market till today  Consequently  carriers of member states could fly freely to within members  Now with Britain exiting EU  the entire issue has become complex 
What s in Store for US Carriers 
We expect U S  airlines to be hit by the Brexit results too  In fact  carriers with significant exposure are likely to feel the pinch more than others  The 2007 open skies agreement had facilitated the travel of U S  through the EU apart from encouraging tie ups with their European counterparts  Now with Brexit materializing  the future direction to be taken by the EU US Open Skies Agreement is anybody s guess  For now  we have identified 4 U S  carriers that could be at risk following UK s vote to leave the EU 
American Airlines Group Inc  Based in Fort Worth  Texas  the carrier has high exposure to Britain mainly due to its partnership with British Airways  The partnership apart  the carrier apparently has a higher exposure to UK than its peers with respect to capacity with  focused on the nation 
Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    Based in Atlanta  GA  the carrier operates quite a number of flights to Britain and has a significant stake in British airline  Virgin Atlantic  Last month  Delta strengthened its ties with Virgin Atlantic  The carriers altered their respective schedules for the summer of 2017 to facilitate travel between the U S  and the U K  The introduction of four weekly flights connecting Portland and London from May 26  2017  was the highlight of the program  The Brexit vote has tossed the future of this partnership 
United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    This Chicago based carrier flies extensively to the U K  which could hurt its profits substantially  In fact  the carrier is likely to be affected the most according to an Investors  News Daily report 
Alaska Air Group  This Seattle  WA based owner of Alaska Airlines might also feel the pinch of Britain s departure  The carrier has a partnership with British Airways for some of its key routes  Usually passengers travelling domestically with Alaska book the carry forward trip on one of its partner airlines such as British Airways  With the pound losing value with respect to the U S  dollar  traffic from Britain will is likely to suffer  As a result  Alaska s revenue and volumes would decline on domestic routes which serve as connectors for trans Atlantic destinations ",2016-06-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-u.s.-airline-stocks-at-risk-as-uk-opts-for-brexit-200138126,200138126

Airlines for America s forecast represents a 4  increase compared to last summer s record high flight demand   To accommodate the surge of passengers  airlines will be providing 2 78 million seats per day   If most of those seats get filled  you probably won t want to miss out on these stocks that stand to profit big from what might be a very promising summer for airliners 
Hawaiian Airlines   NASDAQ HA  
Hawaiian Airlines is the largest airline headquartered in Hawaii   Many Americans love going to this popular vacation state because of its culture  weather  and beautiful beaches   Hawaiian Airlines is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
HA  like every other stock in this article  has some attractive valuation metrics backing it up   Hawaiian shares trade at a forward PE of 9 11   They also have a PEG of 0 54  and a price to sales of 0 94   When either of these metrics is below one  they may suggest that a company is undervalued 
Hawaiian s earnings are projected to grow by 48 54  this year   It also projects sales growth of 2 84  for fiscal 2016   The company has beaten our EPS consensus in three of the last four quarters   Last quarter  the company beat our consensus estimate by 6 67  
JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU  
JetBlue Airways is a low cost airliner that mainly serves US destinations   JetBlue is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   and it has a market cap of  5 91 billion   JBLU stock is not as volatile as most stocks  since it has a beta of just 0 56 
JetBlue trades at a forward PE of 7 89  which is less than the average PE of 8 36 for airliners   JBLU has a price to sales of 0 88 and PEG of 0 58  so it could be a bargain right now  
This year  JetBlue s earnings and sales are projected to grow by 19 01  and 4 86  respectively   JBLU has a debt to capital of 28 07   so it is not too leveraged by any means   The company has beaten our EPS consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters   Just last quarter  the corporation beat our consensus by 11 32

The company trades at a price to sales of 0 39 and a forward PE of 9 19   What s really noteworthy about SkyWest is the fact that it trades at a price to book of 0 76   When a company s price to book is under 1  it may be significantly undervalued  
SKYW projects EPS growth of 27 94  this year   Its margins are relatively slim  but the company s operating cash flows saw impressive growth in 2015   For the current quarter  four analysts have revised their EPS estimates upwards   SkyWest has beaten our EPS consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters by an average of 63 22  per quarter  so it may be well positioned to surpass our expectations when it reports its quarterly earnings on the 4th of August

180267,401783,JBLU,Can Airlines Combat Rising Fuel Costs ,opinion,Despite lingering oversupply worries and a vacillating dollar  U S  crude prices continue to hover around the  50 mark  Recent production disruptions in Libya  Canada and Nigeria helped crude prices to cross  50 per barrel for the first time in seven months on Thursday  However  they closed lower and continue to remain below this psychological level But the airline industry is facing trouble on this count  Several large carriers are planning to take steps in the immediate future to combat an assault on their top lines  Despite satisfactory performances during the quarter  investors are clamoring for more  which may translate into higher airfares PRASMs Under PressureThe biggest headwind airlines are facing at this point is a key revenue metric   passenger revenue per available seat mile or PRASM  This is a measure of sales relative to the capacity of a carrier For instance  last month United Continental Holdings Inc    NYSE UAL   reported first quarter 2016 earnings  on an adjusted basis  of  1 23 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents  Consolidated PRASM or unit revenue declined 7 4  year over year This was a direct outcome of falling fares  which in turn are a result of lower fuel costs  Over the last two years  carriers have saved billions of dollars due to falling fuel costs  But this phenomenon has also proved to be detrimental since it resulted in airlines adding more and more seats to accommodate higher demand from passengers Fare Hikes LikelyBy last year  airfares had fallen to a record low  An average round trip around the U S had reached a five year low  Airfares are continuing to fall this year with even trips to European destinations becoming more and more affordable  And this is giving airlines enough cause for worry It is now clear that airlines have been adding seats at a faster rate than the demand at which it was growing   Now  major carriers are preparing to raise fares  However  such changes are unlikely to happen in the near future  Fares are likely to remain low during a period when travel peaks Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   has recently announced that it plans to cut growth at a faster rate this year  Delta expects passenger carrying capacity to increase by 2 5  as the fourth quarter approaches  compared to the end of last year  This is significantly lower than the 5 4  growth logged in the first quarter  United Continental has reduced planned growth for the current year by 0 5 percentage point  Meanwhile  American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL   has decided to cut planned international growth for 2016 from 6  to 2 5   Similar announcements may be forthcoming from JetBlue Airways Corporation   NASDAQ JBLU   and Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV   In ConclusionAir travelers have enjoyed a long period of low fares thanks to falling fuel prices  This situation is unlikely to change drastically in the near future  However  by the end of the year  they may have to pay higher prices in order to fly  In the interim period  they are likely to face the snaking queues at airports as they prepare to fly out for their vacations ,2016-05-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-airlines-combat-rising-fuel-costs-200132938,200132938
180270,401786,JBLU,Good Times To Continue For Airlines  IATA Says So ,opinion,"Stocks in the airline space have hit a purple patch in spite of a few adverse factors  The decline in oil prices since mid 2014 has been a major boon for the stocks in this space  Meanwhile  the release of the profit forecast for 2016 by the International Air Transport Association  IATA  unveils a bright picture  again  thanks to cheap oil 
Soft oil prices have resulted in massive savings for carriers  courtesy a sharp reduction in their operating expenses as fuel costs represent a significant chunk of airline costs  Despite the recent rally  oil prices are still hovering around the  50 a barrel mark  a long way off the highs of mid 2014 when the commodity had traded in excess of  100 a barrel  Naturally  this has aided the bottom line of carriers significantly resulting in impressive performances with respect to earnings per share 
Profitability Forecast 
At its Annual General Meeting in Dublin  the IATA increased its projection for 2016 global net profit for the industry to  39 4 billion from the earlier  36 3 billion  The comparable 2015 figure was  35 3 billion  In the event of the forecast coming true  2016 would be the fifth successive year of profit improvement for the airline industry 
The bulk of the global profits   22 9 billion  is expected to come from the North American region  The other regions  namely  Asia Pacific  Europe  Latin America  Middle East and Africa are expected to generate post tax net profit of  7 8 billion   7 5 billion   0 1 billion and  1 6 billion  respectively  African carriers are expected to continue their dismal performance in 2016  suffering losses to the tune of  0 5 billion 
Global net profit margin is expected to expand to 5 6  in 2016 from 4 9  a year ago  The top line is however projected to shrink 1 3  to  709 billion with passenger revenues dropping 1 3  to  511 billion and cargo revenues recorded a decline  Cargo demand is expected to grow only 2 1   below the 2015 growth levels 
According to the forecast  2016 is expected to see air travel growth of 6 2  compared with 7 4  growth witnessed last year  Capacity is projected to increase by 6 8  in 2016 as opposed to the 6 7  increase seen in 2015  According to the forecast  load factor    of seats filled by passengers  for 2016 is expected to decline 40 basis points to 80  due to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth  Yield is projected to decline 7  and unit costs are expected to reduce by 7 7  
The research firm has also predicted that airline companies will earn  10 42 per passenger in 2016  The firm holds that oil prices will continue to fall in 2016 with the average price in the year hovering around  45 per barrel  down 16 5   Fuel expenses are expected to decline considerably to  127 billion in 2016 
Although it is a fact that most carriers hedge at least some of their fuel costs  the majority of them should still continue to benefit considerably from the plunge in oil prices  Notably  carriers use a combination of calls  swaps and collars at varying WTI crude equivalent price levels to hedge fuel costs 
IATA Forecast Follows Bullish A4A View
The rosy picture painted by the IATA for North American carriers  which include the likes of United Continental Holdings Inc    NYSE UAL    Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV    JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU    American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and Alaska Air Group Inc    NYSE ALK    comes close on the heels of the forecast provided by Airlines for America   A4A    According to the projection  the three month period between June and August will be the busiest one for U S  carriers in terms of air travel 
Headwinds Remain 
Despite the benefits driven mainly by low oil prices  carriers are not bereft of headwinds  Issues like capacity woes  declining passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM   multiple probes and labor strife continue to hurt stocks in the space  These headwinds resulted in the NYSE ARCA Airline index losing 3 67  so far in 2016 
It is no secret that pricing and capacity worries have plagued airline stocks for quite some time  That capacity woes will continue to hurt carriers in 2016 was revealed by the IATA which expects capacity growth  6 8   to outpace traffic expansion  6 2    According to the report  capacity expansion has outpaced traffic growth for carriers in all regions except Latin America which includes the likes of GOL Linhas   NYSE GOL   ",2016-06-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/good-times-to-continue-for-airlines-iata-says-so-200133741,200133741

Key Takeaways
The Estimize community calls for EPS of  0 71 and revenue of  2 55 billion  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates 
MasterCard revenues declined 10  in 2015 largely due to a strong US dollar
New tech innovations like MasterPass and a partnership with Coin will help MasterCard defends its market share against Visa Inc  N V  and PayPal Holdings Inc  O PYPL  
Global payment network  MasterCard  is scheduled to report Q4 2015 earnings January 29th before the opening bell  After beating estimates in 5 of the last 6 quarters  MasterCard is expected to underwhelm investors thanks to a strong U S  dollar and heavy expenses from updating payment technologies  The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 72 and revenue of  2 548 billion  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a projected YoY growth in EPS and revenue of 4  and 6   respectively  For years  MasterCard held a competitive advantage  leveraging international growth to take a leadership role in payment services  However  currency headwinds on top of increasing competition from online payment processors  like PayPal  have forced MasterCard to defend its market share 

This past quarter MasterCard s earnings came under threat as the dollar grew stronger and increasing investments were made in expanding its payment technologies  In a given year  MasterCard derives about 60  of its revenue from international operations  This exposure to global markets has caused earnings to contract due to a strong dollar  In fact  it is estimated that the dollar has contributed to a 10  decline in MasterCard s revenue  Moreover  a slowdown in the global economy has had an adverse effect on consumer spending overseas 
MasterCard also struggles with competitive threats from Visa and PayPal  So far  PayPal has done a good job of taking away market share from the traditional credit industry  Consequently  MasterCard has made heavy investments into payment technology and recently launched its payment app  MasterPass  MasterCard hopes its new mobile payment app will increase transaction volume and frequency  Notable partnerships with JetBlue Airways Corporation  O JBLU  and Coin should also facilitate payment processing through all forms of technology  As long as MasterCard can maintain solid growth and new product rollouts  a bounce back is inevitable ",2016-01-29,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-new-products-help-mastercard’s-q4-earnings-382184,382184
180293,401809,JBLU,As Cuba Embargo Is Lifted  U S  Airlines Start Their Engines ,opinion,"For millions of tourists every year  Las Vegas is the premiere travel destination for luxury hotels  glitzy nightclubs and extravagant casinos  But for a time  hordes of high rolling American celebrities and affluent vacationers were beckoned also by the sultry nightlife of Havana  Cuba  Dozens of regularly scheduled flights by the day carried pleasure seekers from Miami to the glittering shores of the Cuban capital 
This all came to an end  of course  once the U S  imposed a strict embargo on the Caribbean nation  following the coup led by Fidel Castro  whose rise to power devastated 
Now  more than 50 years later  this market is set to open up once again  and airlines couldn t be more delighted  The U S  and Cuba both agreed this week to reestablish scheduled air service  authorizing up to 120 commercial flights a day 20 between the U S  and Havana  another 10 between the U S  and nine other Cuban cities 
Competition to secure route access is likely to become red hot  American Airlines  O AAL   United  N UAL  and JetBlue  O JBLU  have already expressed interest  with American saying it  looks forward to submitting a Cuba service proposal   But expect many more carriers to submit counter proposals in an attempt to gain the first mover advantage  Once regular service begins  possibly as early as this summer  an estimated 1 5 million American tourists will make their way to Cuba within the first year alone  This raises the question of whether the island s tourism infrastructure is ready for such an influx of visitors  representing a huge opportunity for not just airlines but also car rental companies  food and beverage companies and hotel chains 
To prepare for this explosion of visitors  the Cuban government is already seeking foreign investors 
It s important to point out here that the embargo has been lifted for all forms of travel to Cuba except pure tourism  Americans can currently visit for up to 12 different approved reasons including business  family  education and religious activities but if policy continues to evolve at its current rate  pleasure should also be included one day 
American Business Returns to Cuba
Just as American tourists once flocked to Havana  so too were American businesses deeply entrenched in Cuba  Before the embargo  U S  financial interests were involved in Cuban mines  utilities  railways  sugar production and more 
That s set to change too  as the U S  government just granted an Alabama company permission to build a small factory in Cuba the first to do so in over half a century  it s believed  The company  Cleber  will produce affordable tractors designed for the Cuban market 
With normalization between the U S  and Cuba being restored  and populations trending younger  many Americans are starting to abandon their Cold War era attitudes  Since 1996  Gallop has polled Americans on their overall opinion toward Cuba  and for the first time this year  a majority of respondents 54 percent held a favorable view of the island nation 
Favorability has been rising steadily since 2006  in fact  which suggests that Americans increasingly see Cuba as a potential place to visit and do business in  This is what U S  airlines  not to mention companies in other industries  are hoping to capitalize on

180296,401812,JBLU,Earnings Beat Galore At Airlines  Is All Well Otherwise ,opinion,"As the first quarter earnings season draws to a close  we take note of the impressive bottom line performances posted by many of the airline stocks  On taking a closer look at the releases  it is clear that cheap oil has notably benefitted the airlines  bottom lines 
It is a well documented fact that cheap oil has helped airline stocks cut operating expenses to a great extent  The substantial savings has thus helped the carriers boost their shareholder friendly  dividends  buybacks  and employee friendly  profit sharing  activities 
Is Cheap Oil to Be Thanked 
The first quarter of 2016 has seen major airline companies like Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV    American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL    United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL   and Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK   report better than expected earnings  Meanwhile  we can take a look at the factors that might have brought about the earnings beats in this quarter 
Oil prices have been weak for over 18 months  Given the extended period of the slump  it is quite natural analysts had already taken this major tailwind for airlines into consideration while arriving at their earnings per share estimates  With cheap oil already factored in  we believe that the reason behind the earnings beats lies elsewhere 
Despite the obvious benefit from the plummeting oil prices  the airline industry is not free from headwinds ranging from passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  woes  strengthening of the U S  dollar and terror attacks  In view of these headwinds  the earnings per share estimates have been trimmed over the past few months  With the bar  pertaining to earnings estimates  being lowered significantly  courtesy the drastic downward revisions  it is of little surprise that most carriers have managed to beat the  highly conservative  Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter 
It is also to be noted that oil prices have recovered to a great extent over the past few months  Currently  oil is hovering around the  45 a barrel mark  reflecting a significant increase from the 12 year low of  26 21 recorded in February  Thus  it is clear that low oil prices have not been the factor behind the outperformance by the airlines this quarter 
In spite of the impressive earnings performances in the first quarter  there are a number of headwinds prevalent in the airline space  Let s take a look 
Roadblocks
The main headwind threatening stocks in the space is with respect to a key revenue metric PRASM  a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier   As in the past few quarters  this key metric impacted the top line of the carriers in the first quarter too  For instance  sector heavyweights such as Delta  United Continental and JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU   reported lower than expected revenues in the quarter hurt by unit revenue woes  Lower fuel surcharges on international flights due to weak oil prices have been one of the main reasons behind the persistent decline in PRASM  Consequently  plunging oil prices have become a double edged sword for carriers 
That PRASM will continue to hurt the stocks going forward too can be made out from the second quarter projections for the metric  For example  United Continental expects consolidated PRASM to decline in the band of 6 5  to 8 5  for the second quarter while American Airlines forecasts a 6  to 8  drop in the metric  Capacity related issues have also been an adverse factor 
Moreover  airline stocks have been hurt by the frequent terror attacks which have affected demand to a great extent  The Brussels attacks  in Mar 2016  impacted Delta s top line in the first quarter while the Paris assault had impacted Air France KLM SA s   OTC AFLYY   revenues last year  Furthermore  outbreaks of diseases like the Zika virus and disputes similar to the ongoing one between legacy U S  carriers and their Gulf counterparts pose challenges to the stocks in the airline space 
To Wrap Up
The above write up clearly suggests that despite the series of earnings beats in the first quarter  the airline space is not free from challenges  We note that despite posting an earnings beat in the first quarter on Apr 26  shares of JetBlue Airways were hurt by the 8  decline in PRASM to 11 35 cents and 7  fall in operating revenue per available seat mile to 12 41 cents  Moreover  the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline index has declined above 6  over the past month further substantiates the fact that the series of earnings beats in the airline space have failed to cheer investors ",2016-05-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-beat-galore-at-airlines:-is-all-well-otherwise-200129623,200129623
180305,401821,JBLU,Looking To Fly Higher With JetBlue,opinion,"Airlines have been big beneficiaries of the lower fuel cost  If you look at the chart of most of them it is like they are on a full power takeoff path  And the chart of JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ JBLU  is no exception  That is great if you have been holding the stock for the last 9 months  But isn t it too late to buy it now  Not really 
The first thing to remember about stocks is that you can buy low and sell high  which is a good thing  Or you can buy high and sell low  not recommended  This is the fear that comes to mind when a stock has been in an uptrend for 9 months  That you will buy the top and lose it all  But there is a third choice  buy high and sell higher 


In fact the best place to look for new stocks to own is the new 52 week high list  That is because stocks that are going up tend to keep going up  Not forever  but they can for a long time  JetBlue fits this category and looks to be a good buy now or upon making a new 52 week high  What gets left out of the discussion is whether there is a place to mange risk in the new stock 
JetBlue gives you a few of options for that  The first is at point A  If you buy this stock on a new all time high over 24 19 you could use a very tight stop at the trend line at 23 90  A bit looser stop loss placement at point B will get you out of the stock if it crosses the 20 day SMA  a line that has been a good approximation of bullish or bearish trends in the stock  And a wider stop at point C will protect you against JetBlue crash landing to a new lower low

180309,401825,JBLU,After Delta s Big Miss  More Disappointment Ahead For Airlines ,opinion,"Key Takeaways
Despite the plunge in oil prices  airlines have not been passing fuel savings onto consumers  and have instead hiked fares 
The Estimize community is more bullish on the discount domestic airlines as compared to the large international carriers  as they do not have to deal with foreign currency headwinds 
N LUV  N ALK and N UAL are all out tomorrow  do you think they ll go the same way as N DAL 
 kicked off Q4 2015 earnings for the airlines on a sour note yesterday morning  missing expectations on both the top and bottom line  The Estimize community had been anticipating a  25M miss on revenues  but the actual came in  100M lower than that  As expected  the airline blamed foreign currency pressures  which impacted operating revenues by  160M  and reduced passenger unit revenue by 2 percentage points  Despite efforts to hedge currency headwinds by limiting certain international routes and bulking up on domestic ones  Delta still couldn t hit the mark 
Airline results come on the heels of an industry wide fare hike  On January 5  five major airlines including American Airlines Group  O AAL   Delta  JetBlue Airways Corporation  O JBLU   Southwest and United all announced they were raising one way U S  domestic flight prices by  3  The news came at an uncertain time for the industry which is currently under investigation by the US Justice Department for potentially conspiring to keep fares artificially inflated by limiting the volume of flights 


AAL data by YCharts
The latest price hike also comes amidst deteriorating oil prices  Airlines have been posting tremendous growth for the past several quarters in part due to fuel savings  It was initially believed that these savings would be passed onto the consumer  but instead flight prices have only increased  The S P 500 airline industry  contains Delta  United  Southwest and American  is expected to post year over year earnings growth of 63  in Q4  compared to the overall S P 500 which is anticipated to see profits decline by 2 2   However  revenues are estimated to come in flat for the quarter  a pattern we re continually seeing this season  strong earnings growth paired with languishing sales 

 Delta growth rates reflect actuals reported on 1 19  All other growth rates are estimated 
Another trend being closely monitored this earnings season is the disparity in expectations for discount airlines vs  larger carriers  Discount domestic airlines that fly to very few  if any  international destinations  do not have to contend with the stronger dollar impact  Currency headwinds have been such a drag on multinational airlines  that several large carriers have decreased several international routes  As such  the Estimize consensus for some of these names deviates from Wall Street 


On Thursday we get results from Southwest and United Continental  The Estimize community is more bullish on Southwest  expecting EPS of  0 92  two cents higher than the Street s consensus  and revenues of  5 05B as compared to the  4 99B estimate from the sell side  On the other hand  Estimize is currently looking for United to miss EPS estimates by a penny  Even with a miss  that would still denote 117  profit growth for UAL from the year ago period  while revenues are anticipated to decline 2  ",2016-01-21,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/disappointment-ahead-for-airlines-luv,-ual-and-alk-out-with-results-tom-380912",380912

Another low cost carrier   Virgin America  NASDAQ VA    outshone the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the top and the bottom line fronts  However  the company s guidance on capacity and passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  was disappointing 
On the non earnings front  headlines were dominated by the news of a technical glitch that delayed flights at American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL   Airline behemoth Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  reported traffic data for April  which was adversely impacted by a strong dollar  as has been the case for the last few months 
Alaska Air Group  NYSE ALK   the parent company of Alaska Airlines  reported healthy traffic numbers for April on the back of strong demand  Another major event in the airline space in the past week was the launch of the airline ETF   the Global Jets ETF  NYSE  JETS    on April 30  2015 
The NYSE ARCA Airline index declined 1 35  over the past five trading days mainly due to resurgent oil prices and Spirit Airlines  tepid guidance  The launch of the airline ETF  however  pleased investors  curbing the magnitude of the fall of the index 
Recap of the Past Week s Most Important Stories 
1  Spirit Airlines  first quarter 2015 earnings  excluding special items  of 96 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Operating revenues grew 12 6  from the year ago quarter to  493 4 million  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The budget carrier said that it expects RASM to decline in the range of 14  to 15  for the quarter ending Jun 30  2015  
2  Delta Air Lines stated  while reporting traffic figures for the month  that its April PRASM  on a consolidated basis  declined 3 5  year over year due to foreign exchange pressure  A strong dollar negatively impacted international business 
Moreover  lower surcharges in international markets also hurt results  Airline traffic  measured in revenue passenger miles  went up 1 8  year over year to 16 87 billion on a consolidated basis  Domestic traffic climbed 2 6  in the month  while the same on the international front was up a mere 0 6  
Consolidated capacity or available seat miles improved 3 7  to 20 29 billion  Load factor    of seats filled with passengers  stood at 87  for domestic flights  up 0 6  year over year  However  the metric declined 360 basis points  bps  to 79 1  on international flights  Consolidated load factor was down 150 bps to 83 2   The company registered a completion factor of 99 8   with 86 8  of its flights on schedule

5  Several flights of American Airlines Group recently experienced significant delays due to a software glitch  According to media reports  pilots  iPads crashed abruptly resulting in the delay  Incidentally  iPads are used by the airline for distributing flight plans and other relevant information to its crew 
Performance 
The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last 6 months 

As the chart above suggests  all the airline stocks    with the exception of JetBlue Airways  NASDAQ JBLU     traded in the red over the past week  Shares of Spirit Airlines suffered the most losing 11 85  in the face of a weak RASM guidance provided for the second quarter  Meanwhile  most of the stocks have gained over the last six months  with JetBlue witnessing the highest upside  67 06   over the period

180327,401843,JBLU,Airline Roundup  Southwest Capacity Forecast Triggers Major Selloff,opinion,"There were quite a few updates last week from companies in the airline industry  However  all that was overshadowed by the airline sell off that reflected dwindling investor confidence  The airline industry  which has had an incredibly good run over the past couple of years  tumbled significantly last Wednesday 
The trigger was Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  announcement at the Wolfe research global transportation conference that it plans to increase its capacity in the band of 7  to 8  in 2015 as opposed to the earlier projection of a 7  increase 
Southwest s projection caused panic among investors who feared that the capacity expansion would lead to an oversupplied market even as fuel costs continue to be weak  The capacity additions could further result in a possible price war between legacy and low cost airlines 
Meanwhile  American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL  CEO Doug Parker stated that the carrier intends to compete aggressively against the capacity expansion and will not lose customers on pricing grounds  However  some market watchers have called the selloff  which caused a loss of approximately  10 billion in market value last Wednesday  a mere overreaction 
Apart from this  airline behemoth Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  was in the headlines owing to its plans for expansion in Brazil  Not falling behind  Southwest Airlines  in keeping with its expansion initiatives  announced a new non stop service from the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport  DCA  to Orlando  FL  effective Nov 1  2015 
According to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  average airfares in the U S  for the month of April decreased 1 3  over Mar 2015  The April figure was also down 7 5  on a year over year basis

Overall  it was a bearish week for the sector  Major airline stocks plummeted in the wake of the airline sell off  The upward movement of oil prices added to the woes  In view of this bearish sentiment  the NYSE ARCA Airline index declined 3 4  over the past week 

Recap of the Past Week s Most Important Stories 
1  Share prices of major airline stocks including Southwest Airlines  United Continental Holdings Inc  NYSE UAL  and American Airlines plummeted following the news that Southwest Airlines intends to increase its capacity in the range of 7  to 8  in 2015 as opposed to the earlier projection of a 7  increase 
Investors were clearly concerned that airline capacity growth at a rate higher than the U S  GDP would lead to an oversupplied market  With major airline stocks plummeting  the recently launched airline ETF   U S  Global Jets ETF   also lost value 
2  Delta Air Lines  which is constantly looking to expand its operations  filed for regulatory approval to connect Orlando  FL and Sao Paulo  Brazil  Delta intends to introduce non stop flights on the route effective Dec 19  2015 following the approval  Delta s agreement with Brazilian carrier Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA  NYSE GOL  should pay off well in this regard 
3  In a bid to expand its operations and improve customer convenience  Southwest Airlines announced that it intends to boost its service in Florida  In line with this objective  the carrier intends to introduce a non stop flight on a daily basis on the DCA  Orlando route from Nov 2015 
4  Data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest that average airfares in the U S  for Apr 2015 declined 7 5  on a year over year basis  Soft oil prices over the period and increased competition were primarily responsible for the decline  The figure was down 1 3  from Mar 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis  once again reflecting the brunt of soft oil prices 
5  Ryanair Holdings reported robust financial and operating numbers with net profit for fiscal 2015 up 66  year over year at  867 million  Moreover  load factor increased 500 basis points to 88  while air traffic for the year jumped 11  to 90 6 million  The strong performance of Ryanair was mainly buoyed by lower fuel prices  attractive fares  continuous route expansion  allocated seating and extra carry on luggage facilities 
Moreover  the carrier has launched the AGB program which has drawn massive number of new customers to Ryanair  In order to target business class passengers  Ryanair has launched business friendly air ticket facilities which have further driven demand for the carrier  thus ramping up profits  However  profit for the reported period was offset by the company s decision to enter into a long term fuel hedge contract of  92 per barrel 
Robust passenger growth coupled with the onset of one of the busiest summer holiday seasons ever has encouraged the carrier to expect profits for fiscal 2016 in the range of  940 million to  970 million  The company also plans to carry more than 100 million passengers for the first time in fiscal 2016

180331,401847,JBLU,Why You Should Be Bullish On Delta Airlines After Iran s Nuclear Deal,opinion,"Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL  is set to report FQ2 earnings this Wednesday before the opening bell  The Estimize EPS consensus is set at  1 27  5 cents above Wall Street s expectations  In terms of revenue  the Estimize consensus is above the Wall Street consensus at  10 7B  making for an interesting delta  These numbers would put Delta s year over year  YoY  earnings and revenue growth at 6  and 1  respectively 

As one of the major players in the airline industry  Delta has had to struggle with recent trends in the global economy  From the beginning of March to the end of June  the price of a barrel of oil rose nearly 20   although it is still down from an all time high in recent years  As of the first quarter of this year  fuel accounts for nearly 23  of the airline s total costs  and this drastic change in oil prices could negatively affect Delta s bottom line 

Recently  oil prices have taken a big hit due to talks in halting Iran s nuclear program  As of this morning  a recent deal signed between the U S  and five other world powers will halt the country s development of nuclear weapons  In exchange for stopping Iran s nuclear activities  the U S   the European Union  and the United Nations will lift sanctions on the country that will allow it to possibly double its oil exports  A hike in the supply of oil will drastically curb prices downwards  a change desperately needed by Delta 

The company has consistently struggled amongst other transportation companies  returning an unimpressive  11 8  year to date  versus rival JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ JBLU  at 40 79  and the Dow Jones Transportation Average  DJTA  at  9 40  

The company has also had to battle with problems surrounding the stronger dollar in foreign countries  As published in Delta s first quarter filings with the SEC in April of this year  approximately   of its revenue from passengers comes from outside of the United States  A stronger dollar would impact foreign customers  ability to travel  resulting in a decrease in foreign revenue ",2015-07-15,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-you-should-be-bullish-on-delta-airlines-after-iran’s-nuclear-deal-258371,258371
180347,401863,JBLU,American Airlines Is A Strong Buy Now,opinion,"A  IntroductionLike it s airline rivals  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   United Airlines  UAL   and JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ JBLU   American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  has been on an absolute tear the last six months  American Airlines managed to scrap its fuel hedging scheme just in time to take advantage of the collapse in crude oil  and has thus benefited tremendously from lower jet fuel prices  We believe the company offers the rare opportunity in which the stock combines an attractive valuation with strong price momentum  profitability  and growth  Each of these factors is good determinant of future success  and we will outline why as we progress through the analysis  The report will start with a breakdown of American Airlines valuation profile  then will proceed to an analysis of the price and profit growth  followed by an analysis of recent  smart money  transactions  and concluding with some qualitative analysis and conclusions B  Growth BreakdownThere are a variety of different growth metrics that have been shown to predict stock returns  Most important among them is price momentum  Winning stocks   based on six month price performance   and losing stocks keep losing  American Airlines growth breakdown is shown below As we said before  American Airlines has been a beneficiary of lower jet fuel prices and its stock price has reflected that  AAL has gained 30  over the last six months and 42  over the last twelve  which puts it into the top fifth of the entire market in both metrics  AAL grew annual EPS by 135   which is much stronger than the airline group  34    sector  19    and overall market  12   averages  In testament to the strength of American Airlines company management  AAL returned 95  on equity  This is much higher than the airline group and overall market averages  Overall  we rate American Airlines as a  Strong Growth  company due to its combination of price momentum  EPS growth  and superior ROE C  Valuation BreakdownWe ll now move on to an analysis of AAL s valuation profile  Value is important to look at as Nobel laureate Eugene Fama  that  value stocks have higher average returns than growth stocks   AAL s valuation profile is shown below Looking at the traditional value metrics  American Airlines valuation comes out mixed  On a revenue and earnings basis  AAL looks relatively attractive  AAL s sales yield of 115  and earnings yield of 7 6   show that the stock is currently trading at a discount relative to its airline peers  But the stock looks fairly overvalued when looking at it on a book value basis  with its price to book of 18 01 being significantly higher than the airline group average of 5 22  Overall  we rate American Airlines as  Slightly Undervalued  due to its attractive revenue and earnings yields D  Smart Money BreakdownIn addition to value and momentum  we will also analyze how the  smart money  on the street is playing American Airlines  We consider the  Smart money  to be short sellers  company insiders  and institutions  Each of these stakeholders tends to be much more sophisticated than the average investor and thus their transactions give good clues of what is to come  We have found loads of academic research showing that short sellers  company insiders  and institutions all predict stock returns  This  smart money  breakdown for AAL is shown below  click to enlarge 

Relative to the market  the  smart money  on the street is pretty optimistic on American Airlines  Company insiders have essentially maintained their positions in the stock during its price run  while company insiders in other airlines have been dumping their positions   13  in ownership over the last six months   Short interest on AAL has also been very low at 1 76   which is also significantly below the airline average  Clearly  short sellers just don t believe in the short thesis regarding American Airlines  Institutions have been buying into the stock over the last few months  increasing their ownership percentage by 1 85   Overall  we rate the smart money on the street as  moderately bullish  on AAL E  Qualitative Analysis   ConclusionsWe ll now supplement our quantitative analysis with a qualitative discussion of some of the major growth catalysts and risk factors that could impact the stock price in the near future  As we discussed earlier  we believe American Airlines has a very solid management running the company  as evidenced by their track record of strong returns on equity   Management is aware that American Airlines is undervalued  and recently upped their share buyback program to  2 billion  scheduled to the end of 2016  This follows the early completion of their earlier  1 billion buyback program  Share buybacks   especially when the stock is undervalued   have been  to be a very good indicator of future outperformance  While a point can be made about AAL introducing a buyback program  and a new dividend  while the company is still servicing a significant debt load  We don t believe AAL is at a significant risk of defaulting or experiencing a  debt  spiral  especially with the strong industry tailwinds of lower jet fuel prices boosting income 
Overall  we believe American Airlines offers a great opportunity to buy into a stock with great growth  strong management  momentum  an attractive valuation  and with strong industry tailwinds at their back  The share buyback program offers a good catalyst for further outperformance as well  The company releases earnings in about two months  with analysts expecting  1 78 in EPS and  9 95 billion in sales ",2015-02-26,Quantified Alpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-airlines-is-a-strong-buy-now-243245,243245

180360,401876,JBLU,Virgin America Plans IPO At  1 Billion Valuation,opinion,"Virgin America has just reported its fiscal Q3 financial results before the opening bell  and profits are up by about 24  due to an increase in passenger traffic and higher fare rates  Operating revenue was also up by about 4 7   totaling  405 5 million  The company has done very well in the fourth quarter of 2013  and the first quarter of 2014  which has led it to its decision to go public 
Virgin America is one of the only major U S  airlines that is yet to become a publicly traded company  and it will certainly be a highly anticipated debut on the Nasdaq Global Select Market  when it commences trading under the ticker symbol   VA   On Monday  Virgin America laid out the terms for its planned initial public offering regarding 13 3 million shares at a price tag of about  21 share  24 share  The offering is expected to value the company at about  1 billion  based on  24 share  and Virgin America had already filed for its IPO back in July 2014  Cyrus Capital Partners LP and Virgin Group Holdings Ltd  will be the largest shareholders  and a company employee stock ownership vehicle will also be offering approximately 231 000 shares  Virgin America will not be cashing in on the proceeds from the sales of shareholders  shares  PAR Investment Partners LP has also agreed to purchase about  52 1 million of the shares for about 96  of their IPO price in a private deal  Virgin Group Ltd   headed by British billionaire investor  Richard Branson owns part of Virgin America  and it has successfully managed to provide higher net incomes due to truncating flight times and providing shorter routes  On the other hand  Virgin Galactic  also owned by Branson  has been suffering to regain its composure and reputation after a tragic crash incident in which the pilot of a Virgin Galactic LLC rocket ship was killed  and another was severely injured  Allegedly  the rocket ship disintegrated miles above the earth  exposing perhaps a structural failure in the rocket ship  This will definitely delay Branson s ambitious plans and vision of space tourism for the rich  CEO  David Crush  has stated that Virgin America is keen on going public  thanks to surges in overall net incomes  revenues  gross margins  average fares  improved passenger traffic  percentages of seats filled  load factor   and perhaps most importantly  passenger revenue per available seat mile  Virgin America intends on using its share of the IPO proceeds to build on its general corporate structure  including but not limited to  working capital  sales and marketing departments  general and administrative factors  and capital spending  Virgin America is a relatively small airline company  and while it may slightly impact American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL sales  or United Airlines   NYSE UAL  sales  it will not put these two airline goliaths out of business anytime soon  Fears of Ebola are starting to subside  as risk of the disease spreading are lower  and as better infrastructure and protocols are being set up in the infected areas of West Africa  Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   Jet Blue   NASDAQ JBLU   and perhaps Spirit Airlines  NASDAQ SAVE  are all significant players in the domestic flights market  and they may very well be impacted by Virgin America  when and if it continues to come out on top of profit  revenue  and load factor estimates  They will all need to become more competitive  otherwise their shares of the market might be stolen by Virgin America  which is hungry for growth and success  We do not know how Virgin America s stock will fare after the IPO  and investors may be better off investing in LUV or SAVE  as they both carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   and will most likely offer reasonable gains and dividends in the near future  and could be solid choices until VA makes its inaugural flight on the stock market ",2014-11-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/virgin-america-plans-ipo-at-$1-billion-valuation-231310,231310
180362,401878,JBLU,JetBlue To Add Bag Fees  More Seats On Flights  Stock Rallies,opinion,"JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ JBLU  has announced that it will add bag fees and squeeze seats  The decision  which is believed to have been taken in a bid to bolster revenues going forward  was announced at the company s Investor Day  The news caused the shares of the airline to rise by 4 13  to  13 25 on Nov 19  However  the plan naturally failed to find favor with travelers 

The carrier declared that it plans to introduce three ticket classes in the first half of 2015  JetBlue customers with the lowest priced seats will have to shell out fees for all checked luggage  Passengers buying the second category tickets will be able to enjoy at least one piece of checked bag free of cost 

For customers traveling in the most expensive seats  there will be an option for two free checked bags  Incidentally  the airline holds that a flier stands to benefit the most if he chooses the most expensive seat and naturally  the least if he chooses the cheapest one 

Post JetBlue s decision  Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  now remains the only U S  based carrier to allow free check in of a bag for all passengers  JetBlue s new rules come much later compared to its peers  Other major airlines have been following this practice since 2008 

According to a Bloomberg report  bag fees have helped U S  airline companies raise approximately  1 7 billion in the first six months of the current year  Owing to its decision to charge bag fees  JetBlue projects its operating income to increase by more than  200 million annually 

Apart from this  the company also intends to increase the capacity of its Airbus A320 planes by 15 seats to 165   Due to the addition of new seats  the carrier s seat pitch  distance from one seat back to another in the coach class  on A320s will reduce by 1 6 inches to 33 1 inches  The modifications  which will commence in the third quarter of 2016  will take approximately two years to be completed 

As a result of the decision to introduce extra seats  JetBlue projects its operating income to increase by  100 million annually  Annual operating income of the carrier should rise by  150 million as a result of its other initiatives 

On the other hand  from the customer s perspective  the move to cut leg room will increase their discomfort  JetBlue  however  stated that even after the modification  there will be more leg room in the airline s main cabins compared to its peers  For example  the average fleet wide seat patch at Spirit Airlines Inc  NASDAQ SAVE  is 28 3 inches 

JetBlue stated further that 18 Airbus jets will now be delivered between 2022 and 2023  The jets were earlier scheduled to be delivered between 2016 and 2018  Consequently  capital spending at JetBlue will be reduced by more than  900 million through 2017
