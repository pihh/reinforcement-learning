5709,227224,AIRT,Non Farm Payrolls  Global PMIs In Focus,opinion,In the upcoming week  all eyes will be on key economic data both domestically and around the world and markets will be especially sensitive to the effect of these data points on Fed policy  Concerns over Fed tapering its Quantitative Easing program sent markets whip sawing in the previous week and these fears should continue for some time  Key Earnings This week  the earnings calendar is marked by few companies but still with some key reports  Discount retailer Dollar General  DG  is expected to report first quarter results alongside Ciena Corp   CIEN  and Titan Machinery  TITN   Dollar General Discount retail chain Dollar General is expected to report its first quarter operations on Tuesday  June 4  Analysts expect the company to report earnings per share of  0 71 vs   0 63 on revenue of  4 24 billion vs   3 9 billion a year ago  Importantly  Dollar General could comment on the state of consumer spending in the economy as its sales are sensitive to tax refunds  which were issued late this year  as well as tax rates  which increased in the first quarter  Analysts at Wedbush expect a largely positive report next week as they maintain an outperform rating on the stock   There is no specific guidance for Q1  but the company expected 2013 EPS of  3 15  3 30 with comps up 4  6   Management expected gross margins to contract at a rate higher than the rest of the year due to anticipated higher shrinkage  higher markdowns  and lower markups  which are mostly due to the impact of higher tobacco sales  However  gross margin erosion was expected to moderate during the rest of the year    We forecast Q1 EPS of  0 70 vs   0 63 with comps of  2 5  vs   6 7   consensus is at EPS of  0 71 with comps of  2 5   When it reported Q4 results on 3 25  management noted that QTD weather had been unusually cold  and we saw little improvement by the end of the quarter   However  management expected some eventual benefit from what it estimated as  18 billion in delayed tax refunds    Our  58 price target assumes DG should trade at approximately 15x our 2014 EPS estimate of  3 75  Our target multiple is in line with our projected L T earnings growth rate of 15   given quality of execution and longer term organic growth potential   Bank of America Merrill Lynch also views the company positively ahead of its earnings release  having increased its price target on the stock to  60 from  55 earlier this month  The analysts at BAML have a buy rating on Dollar General   We are upgrading Dollar General to Buy from Neutral and raising our PO to  60 from  55  representing 18x 2013 P E  16x 2013 prior   while maintaining our above  guidance 2014E EPS of  3 35  With DG s recent credit rating upgrade  debt refinancing and near lifting of the private equity overhang  we expect sentiment toward the name to continue to strengthen  particularly as DG outperforms Family Dollar on comps  margins and EPS growth over the coming quarters    Despite near term margin and comp headwinds  1Q13 faces a tough compare   we think DG s longer term prospects remain compelling  6 7  square footage growth  3 5  comp  operating margin expansion and growing capital return  The initiation of a dividend in the future would also be a positive catalyst  Strategy and execution remain very solid  and we expect continued remodels  new services and cooler door expansion to increase relevancy and ticket   Ciena Corporation Communications equipment maker Ciena Corporation is also expected to report earnings next week  On Thursday  Ciena is expected to report a second quarter loss per share of  0 01 vs  earnings per share of  0 04 a year ago  Revenue is expected to grow to  483 34 million from  477 62 million a year ago  Morgan Stanley has an equal weight rating on the stock heading into earnings  They have a base case target price of  18 on the stock but see the price target rising to  25 in the bull case should margins expansion accelerate and the corporate investment cycle picks up   We believe Ciena has increased visibility on revenue this year and next  as it is now feeling the full weight of the North America capex upgrade cycle  High margin products are beginning to grow  although mix remains volatile  product gross margin now has the potential of hitting the mid 40 s vs our prior thesis that it remains at best 40 42  giving us more confidence in a higher normalized LT operating margin    We are remaining Equal weight as in the near term  gross margin falls again next quarter  while opex goes back up creating continued margin volatility  In addition  we believe revenue and EPS growth remains lumpy  as new deals are large and the timing of revenue recognition is difficult to predict   Titan Machinery Lastly  construction equipment retailer Titan Machinery is expected to report first quarter results on Thursday as well  The company is expected to report quarterly EPS of  0 19 vs   0 36 a year ago on revenue of  479 98 million vs   421 72 million a year ago  Notably  the company lowered quarterly guidance in late May and analysts reacted to this change  The company attributed the weaker operations in the quarter to the colder than expected weather postponing purchases of equipment  Analysts at M Partners commented on the preliminary operations and the full quarterly report   For Q1 F14  Titan expects fully diluted EPS will be between a loss of  0 01 and a loss of  0 03  We were expecting fully diluted EPS of  0 22 in Q1 F14  consensus was  0 18  The consensus range of EPS estimates is  0 13 to  0 22    Titan expects revenue in Q1 F14 to be  440 0 million  We were expecting revenue of  480 4 million in Q1 F14  consensus was  478 3 million   up from  421 7 million in Q1 F13 with about half of the revenue increase stemming from acquisitions made in the 12 months ending April 30  2013   M Partners expects a loss of  0 03 per share for the quarter following the guidance  Piper Jaffray also cut estimates after the guidance came out and commented on the stock ahead of earnings   We are lowering our estimates following management s below consensus 1Q14 pre release and downward revision to FY14 EPS guidance  As we expected  Titan s April ending quarter was negatively impacted by the late spring in both agriculture and construction  Management expects 1Q revenue of  440 mil and an EPS loss in the range of   0 03      0 01   both falling below our previous street low estimates    Our FY14 EPS estimate of  1 82 is near the midpoint of management s revised guidance range of  1 70    2 00  which is down from the previous range of  2 00    2 30  We are also lowering our FY15 EPS estimate to  2 09 on continued difficulties in the construction segment and a shift in mix of lower margin sales    Price target drops to  21  Neutral  We are applying a lower valuation multiple of 10x CY14  11x prior  as we believe shares of TITN will trade more in line with the peer group multiple  With expectations that 97  mil acres of corn will get planted in time and minimal visibility into improvements in construction we do not see any catalysts in the near term that will expand valuation multiples   Key Economics Releases Next week  the real focus of markets will be on the economics calendar and how
