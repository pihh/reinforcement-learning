175369,396885,CNP,Why Shares of CenterPoint Energy Rose 11  in December,news,"What happened
Shares of CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP   a gas and electric utility based in Houston  rose 11  in December  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  This was a partial reversal from November  when the company s stock suffered a 15 5  decline 
So what
The reason for the December jump in CenterPoint s shares was a new development in the case that was responsible for the stock s big November drop 

In November  the Public Utility Commission of Texas  PUCT     the agency that regulates CenterPoint s largest market  Houston    denied the company s requested rate increase for Houston  CenterPoint s proposal would have allowed it to earn a 10 5  return on equity in the market  but PUCT instead approved a much lower 9 25  return on equity  During CenterPoint s Q3 2019 earnings call  CEO Scott Prochazka offered a bleak view of the company s outlook if that proposed lower rate went into effect  Disappointed investors promptly sold off the stock as analysts rushed to downgrade it  
However  on Dec  12  CenterPoint sent a letter informing PUCT that  CenterPoint Houston  Commission Staff  the Office of Public Utility Counsel  the City of Houston and Houston Coalition of Cities  the Gulf Coast Coalition of Cities  the Texas Coast Utilities Coalition  and Texas Industrial Energy Consumers have been engaged in discussions regarding a possible stipulation  regarding the rate increase  and requested the PUCT commissioners to defer further consideration until January  This seemed promising  and investors bid shares up on the news  
Now what
In a follow up letter to PUCT on Dec  20  CenterPoint stated that  the parties will be working over the coming weeks to finalize the settlement documents for your review and consideration and plan to file them no later than January 9  2020   The next open meeting of PUCT is on Jan  16  
Without further details on what might be in the works  it s impossible to know how the stock will react  It seems likely that the parties will propose a rate change to PUCT that will be somewhere between the 10 5  return requested by the company and the 9 25  return approved by PUCT  but it s unclear what exactly that might be  or what concessions CenterPoint will have to offer in return  
One thing s for sure  Because Houston is CenterPoint s largest market  making up more than 25  of the company s revenue  how this case gets resolved is of paramount importance to CenterPoint shareholders  Smart investors should wait for the final word before buying or selling ",2020-01-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/peen2,2053438
175384,396900,CNP,Can CenterPoint  CNP  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP   which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This energy delivery company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 18 08  
For the most recent quarter  CenterPoint was expected to post earnings of  0 43 per share  but it reported  0 53 per share instead  representing a surprise of 23 26   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 31 per share  while it actually produced  0 35 per share  a surprise of 12 90  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for CenterPoint lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
CenterPoint currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 09   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 27  2020 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-centerpoint-cnp-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200502385,200502385

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is CenterPoint due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  CenterPoint Energy Q3 Earnings Beat  Revenues Up Y YCenterPoint Energy  Inc  reported third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of 53 cents per share  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents by 23 3   The bottom line also improved 36  from the year ago quarter s figure The company s GAAP earnings came in at 47 cents per share compared with35 cents in the prior year quarter The year over year upside can be attributed to higher revenues as well as operating income generated in the third quarter RevenuesCenterPoint Energy s total revenues in the quarter were  2 74 billion  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 4   However  the top line surged 24  from  2 21 billion of revenues generated in the year ago quarter  Notably  increased contribution from both the utility and non utility businesses led to the top line growth Operational ResultsTotal expenses during the third quarter increased 18 3  to  2 350 million The company s operating income also increased 73  year over year to  392 million Interest and other finance charges increased to  134 million from  90 million a year ago Segment ResultsThe Houston electric transmission   distribution segment reported operating income of  269 million in the third quarter compared with  227 million in the year ago quarter The Natural Gas distribution segment reported operating income of  27 million compared with  3 million in the prior year quarter The Energy Services segment registered operating income of  2 million compared with  9 million in the year ago quarter The Infrastructure Services segment reported  42 million of operating income in the reported quarter The Corporate and Other segment generated operating income of  4 million compared with  5 million in the prior year quarter The Indiana electric integrated segment reported operating income of  48 million inthe third quarter of 2019 Financial ConditionAs of Sep 30  2019  CenterPoint Energy had cash and cash equivalents of  259 million  down significantly from  4 231 million as of Dec 31  2018 Total long term debt was  14 014 million as of Sep 30  2019 compared with  8 682 million as of Dec 31  2018 At the end of the third quarter  the company s net cash from operating activities was  1 086 million  down from  1 679 million in the year ago quarter Further  CenterPoint Energy s total capital expenditure totaled  666 million in the third quarter  up from  434 million in the year ago quarter 2019 GuidanceCenterPoint Energy updated its 2019 earnings guidance  The company currently expects to generate earnings per share near the upper end of its earlier provided guidance of  1 60  1 70 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings is pegged at  1 64  which lies below the company s guidance

175432,396948,CNP,Is CenterPoint Energy  CNP  A Good Value Investor Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put CenterPoint Energy  Inc    NYSE CNP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  CenterPoint Energy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 68  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 57  If we focus on the long term PE trend  CenterPoint Energy s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 18 63 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Utilities Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 84  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that CenterPoint Energy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 90  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  CenterPoint Energy has a P S ratio of about 1 04  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 39 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  CenterPoint Energy currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CenterPoint Energy a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for CenterPoint Energy is just 3 13  a level that is lower than the industry average of 3 81  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 20  which is better than the industry average of 8 68  Clearly  CNP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though CenterPoint Energy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of B  This gives CNP a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one upward revision in the past sixty days compared to three downward revision  while the current year estimate has also seen no upward revision compared to one downward revision in the same time period The current quarter consensus estimate declined 7 3  in the past two months  whereas the current year estimate fell 6 25   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below CenterPoint Energy  Inc  Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCenterPoint Energy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor ,2019-12-10,Zacks

175433,396949,CNP,Signs That Your Trading Will Ruin Your Retirement   December 12  2019,opinion,"Maybe you re a seasoned investor and have a good track record with stock picking  And you may have a robust retirement portfolio   perhaps including some Zacks Top Retirement stock selections such as 
Horizon Bancorp  HBNC   CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP  and First Defiance Financial  FDEF  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
Maybe   if you re an exceptional investor who can expertly manage risk and keep up perfectly resolute emotional control in the face of market volatility  Be that as it may  for most investors  there might be better ways to accomplish long term retirement investing objectives 
Active stock trading requires a very different investing approach and risk   reward mindset than investing for retirement 
Managing Retirement Investments  Stock Picking vs  Diversification
Picking individual stocks has the potential for huge returns   but also carries a lot of risk  which is particularly hazardous when investing for retirement 
In fact  a study done by Hendrik Bessembinder revealed that only 4  of equities produced all of the stock market s gains over the last 90 years  All other stocks  broke even  with the increases of 38  canceled out by the losses of the bottom 58  
For even the most expert stock pickers  the chances for long term achievement are thin 
Is Investing Success All In Your Mind 
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
This study suggests that one key reason for investor underperformance is trying to time volatile markets   and that irrational behavior biases tend to compound investor mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
The Bottom Line for Retirement Investors
When it comes to managing your assets for retirement  you must look at performance over the course of years and decades   not weeks or months  Because most traders generally tend to focus on the short term  they may not have the right mindset to achieve successful long term outcomes 
We re not saying you should not trade at all   far from it  If you enjoy trading  perhaps you should put 10  of your investable assets to work in short term investments to seek alpha and outsized returns 
But the point we re making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative  long term approach designed to produce reliable returns  so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals

Usually  advisors advise 15  to 20  of total income saved every month as an objective   yet in the event that you want to retire earlier  you likely need to tighten that number up to 40  or half of your pay  Not a discipline easily practiced when you review or consider that a substantial segment of your paycheck goes to basic  non  negotiable lifestyle needs  But if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle adjustments and trade offs  it s achievable

175465,396981,CNP,CenterPoint Energy  CNP  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy delivery company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 43 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 90 billion  up 31  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CenterPoint 
For CenterPoint  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 12  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that CenterPoint will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CenterPoint would post earnings of  0 31 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 35  delivering a surprise of  12 90  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

175476,396992,CNP,CenterPoint Energy  CNP  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  CenterPoint Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CNP that show why this energy delivery company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For CNP  shares are up 1 61  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry is up 1 47  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 62  compares favorably with the industry s 2 35  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of CenterPoint Energy have increased 1 94  over the past quarter  and have gained 9 41  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 1 77  and 3 64   respectively 
Investors should also take note of CNP s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  CNP is averaging 4 399 659 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with CNP 
Over the past two months  4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CNP s consensus estimate  increasing from  1 64 to  1 66 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that CNP is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep CenterPoint Energy on your short list ",2019-09-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/centerpoint-energy-cnp-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200469167,200469167

To start  stick with the essentials of long term growth investing  Build a diversified portfolio of stocks with exposure to various styles  sizes  sectors  and regions 
You may be able to accelerate your potential retirement earnings by consciously seeking higher returns  and also accepting more risk  in your investment portfolio  But whatever your risk tolerance  your portfolio must be diversified to protect against extreme market movements that could jeopardize your early retirement objective  You can choose from a number of ways to allocate investments to diversify your portfolio  and these should be informed by your individual goals  growth and income needs  appetite for risk  and age 
Once you have accelerated your savings and put an ongoing plan in place  invest your savings into your portfolio as soon as possible  Don t try to time the market  Leave your portfolio alone  and let the compounding nature of the markets do its magic to help grow your retirement nest egg exponentially over time

175501,397017,CNP,CNP Vs  HE  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Utility   Electric Power stocks have likely encountered both CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP  and Hawaiian Electric  HE   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
CenterPoint Energy has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Hawaiian Electric has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that CNP s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CNP currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 01  while HE has a forward P E of 23 73  We also note that CNP has a PEG ratio of 3 32  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  HE currently has a PEG ratio of 5 96 
Another notable valuation metric for CNP is its P B ratio of 2 16  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  HE has a P B of 2 20 
These metrics  and several others  help CNP earn a Value grade of B  while HE has been given a Value grade of C 
CNP stands above HE thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that CNP is the superior value option right now ",2019-09-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cnp-vs-he-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200462307,200462307
175530,397046,CNP,CenterPoint Energy  CNP  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy delivery company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 36 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 1  
Revenues are expected to be  2 66 billion  up 0 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CenterPoint 
For CenterPoint  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 70  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CenterPoint will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CenterPoint would post earnings of  0 41 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 39  delivering a surprise of  4 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

175533,397049,CNP,Earnings Preview  CenterPoint Energy  CNP  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 9  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy delivery company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 1  
Revenues are expected to be  3 85 billion  up 22  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 78  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CenterPoint 
For CenterPoint  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 30  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CenterPoint will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CenterPoint would post earnings of  0 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 36  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

Fundamentally Sound High Flying Stocks to Scale Even HigherA 52 week high generally serves as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  the equity market volatility will always manage to affect some in the end  Only a few lucky ones have a smooth sail while others fall victim to ad hoc strategies More often than not  investors wonder if a high price range has made the stock overpriced  While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless  all stocks hitting a 52 week high are not necessarily overpriced In fact  an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52 week high mark However  a stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling higher with time  So  one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left A particular strategy advises investors to gamble on stocks that have scaled 52 week highs  This is fairly a new approach in the investing rulebook  Borrowing from the basics of Momentum investing  this technique bets on the principle of buying high and selling higher Though skeptics may raise a brow on the mettle of this 52 week high investment strategy  we believe that this  when clubbed with the right set of parameters  will help rake in sizable gains  A wide group of investors today favor stocks with prospects of scaling higher  These investors have mastered the art of finding stocks that have strong upside potential and are still undervalued Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing  this technique bets on  buy high  sell higher  52 Week High  A Good IndicatorMany a time  stocks hitting a 52 week high fail to scale higher despite potential  This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending In fact  overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors  focus  or willingness to pay premium  has helped them reach the level  But that does not always mean an impending decline  Factors such as robust sales  surging profit levels  earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative  In other words  the momentum might continue Also  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted  even if there are no company specific driving forcesFor the rest of this

175590,397106,CNP,5 Fundamentally Sound High Flying Stocks To Scale Higher,opinion,A 52 week high generally serves as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  the equity market volatility will always manage to affect some in the end  Only a few lucky ones have a smooth sail while others fall victim to ad hoc strategies More often than not  investors wonder if a high price range has made the stock overpriced  While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless  all stocks hitting a 52 week high are not necessarily overpriced In fact  an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52 week high mark However  a stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling higher with time  So  one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left A particular strategy advises investors to gamble on stocks that have scaled 52 week highs  This is fairly a new approach in the investing rulebook  Borrowing from the basics of Momentum investing  this technique bets on the principle of buying high and selling higher Though skeptics may raise a brow on the mettle of this 52 week high investment strategy  we believe that this  when clubbed with the right set of parameters  will help rake in sizable gains  A wide group of investors today favor stocks with prospects of scaling higher  These investors have mastered the art of finding stocks that have strong upside potential and are still undervalued Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing  this technique bets on  buy high  sell higher  52 Week High  A Good IndicatorMany a time  stocks hitting a 52 week high fail to scale higher despite potential  This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending In fact  overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors  focus  or willingness to pay premium  has helped them reach the level  But that does not always mean an impending decline  Factors such as robust sales  surging profit levels  earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative  In other words  the momentum might continue Also  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted  even if there are no company specific driving forces Setting the Right

175663,397179,CNP,Is A Southern Company  SO  Dividend Hike On The Horizon ,opinion,"Electric utility firm The Southern Company   NYSE SO   traditionally makes an announcement to up its payout at this time of year 
Let s evaluate whether Southern investors can expect a dividend increase this time around 
With their regulated business models and stability in earnings  utilities are among the most consistent dividend stocks in the market  Southern Company is one such blue chip utility stock 
Based in Atlanta  GA  Southern Company is one of the largest power suppliers in the U S  Offering an enticing dividend yield  the company remains an attractive option for investors seeking for a steady stream of income  Positioned in a niche industry with high barriers to entry  Southern s less volatile  recession proof business model presents a unique opportunity to earn high returns and steady payout hikes each year 
The Business   Financials
Following its merger with AGL Resources  NYSE GAS  on July 1  2016  Southern Company serves approximately nine million customers through its eleven electric and natural gas distribution units in nine states  It boasts of a generating capacity of 46 000 megawatts  around 200 000 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines  and more than 80 000 miles of natural gas pipelines  Southern Company s operations include wholesale electricity generation and natural gas services  retail energy services and natural gas storage operations throughout the country 
A look at the company s 2017 financials suggest that Southern Company reported impressive business performance last year  The power supplier grew its revenues by 16   while adjusted earnings per share was up by more than 4  despite an increase in operating expenses 
Strong Dividend History and Above Average Yield
One of the premier domestic utilities  Southern Company pays an annual dividend of  2 32 per share  yielding an attractive return of 5 3  and above most other utilities  To put things in perspective  the utility offers current yield of 5 3  Meanwhile  the average yields for the utility sector and S P 500 stands at 3 6  and 1 9   respectively 
The firm  its dividend payout by 3 6  in April 2017  marking sixteen consecutive years of such increases  In particular  Southern Company boasts of an uninterrupted streak of paying dividends since 1948 
Room for Modest Hike Despite High Payout Ratio
Using Southern s 2017 adjusted EPS of  3 02  the utility pays out 76 8  of its earnings as a dividend  which is rather high compared to sector s average payout of 64 1   Southern forecasts earnings to fall to  2 80  2 95 per share in the current year  Considering the current annual dividend rate of  2 32 per share  this equates to a steep payout ratio of 79  83  for 2018 
However  Southern also announced its long term earnings per share growth outlook of 4 6   commencing with this year s midpoint of  2 87 per share  We believe this should be sufficient for modest dividend increases 
Importantly  the utility is confident in its ability to sustain a payout ratio in the range of 80  for a few years  which it expects to eventually come back down in the 70s once construction of the Vogtle nuclear plant expansion project ends 
What Exactly to Expect 
As per Southern Company  its financial outlook allows for a dividend growth of 8 cents per year  or 2 cents on a quarterly basis  This seems quite doable  with a 2 cents hike taking the quarterly distribution to 60 cents per share   2 40 per share annualized   which would represent a payout ratio of around 84  and in line with the firm s expectations 
Therefore  going by Southern s target  we see the quarterly dividend increase to 60 cents per share  or 3 4   during the next few days 
Zacks Rank   Stock Picks
Despite being a top dividend growth stock  Southern Company currently retains a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   ostensibly due to continued timing and cost overrun issues over two large construction projects    Vogtle and Kemper 
Georgia PSC s nod for the construction of the half finished Vogtle nuclear plant expansion in Georgia notwithstanding  doubts remain about the  20 billion initiative that has gone well over budget and is years behind schedule  Southern is also facing challenges to place its Kemper  Mississippi project in service  which suffered yet another setback with the suspension of all coal gasification operations amid additional cost burden 
We believe the financial stress from these projects  together with Southern s hefty expenses to comply with environmental controls regulations will cause an underperformance in the utility s shares relative to the market as well as the sector in the coming quarters 
Not surprisingly  the stock has underperformed its industry in a year  having declined 7 4  versus the  0 7  loss 
Meanwhile  one can look at better ranked utilities like CenterPoint Energy  Inc    NYSE CNP    The AES Corp    NYSE AES   and OGE Energy Corp    NYSE OGE   CenterPoint Energy is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock  while both AES Corp  and OGE Energy hold Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
CenterPoint Energy Inc  is a domestic energy delivery company that provides electric transmission   distribution  natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services operations  The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Houston  TX based utility is  1 55  representing some 13 1  earnings per share growth over 2017  Next year s average forecast is  1 64  pointing to another 6 2  growth 
AES Corp   based in Arlington  VA  is a global power company  The company s businesses are spread across five continents in 18 countries  AES s expected EPS growth rate for three to five years currently stands at 7 8   comparing favorably with the industry s growth rate of 7  
OGE Energy Corp  provides energy and offers physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central United States  The Oklahoma City  OK based company has an enviable earnings surprise history  It surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters

175915,397431,CNP,3 Utility Stocks To Count On If Volatility Picks Up,opinion,The utility sector is fundamentally strong and incredibly mature  Utility has maintained a consistent performance  braving market volatility which generally impacts most sectors  The steady performance over the years has been primarily driven by unswerving demand for basic utility services like electricity  gas and water despite economic downturns  In fact  this helps utility companies to consistently boost shareholder value through dividend payouts and share buybacksThe regulated nature of businesses renders a high level of stability to the Utility space  Further  steady dividend yields reduce the chances of price depreciation  However  it s worth mentioning that the regular dividend payments to some extent lower the price growth potential While the continuation of the Trump effect helped the S P 500 gain 5 5  in the first quarter of 2017  the index lost 0 3  in the first week of April  Does this indicate that the Trump rally has started losing steam  Also  sectors including Aerospace and Medical  which recorded earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2016  are expected to see an earnings decline in the first quarter of 2017  This may lead to sluggishness in the market  Read more in our weekly  report What Can Trigger Volatility During the pre election campaign  Trump had said that he will make regulatory changes for certain industries and bring down the corporate profit tax rate  However  Trump has not been successful in making any notable regulatory changes so far  In fact  he failed to repeal the Obamacare Failure to repeal the Obamacare has created doubts in the mind of investors about Trump s ability to act on his pre electoral promises  The upcoming election in France and Germany could lead to more chaos in the European Union  Since the U S  does not operate in isolation in the global market  lower than expected performance by the developing economies will mar the prospects in the U S As these issues in the domestic and international markets gradually unfold  it could trigger volatility in the U S  markets and wipe out the gains registered so far in the last

175940,397456,CNP,4 Utility Stocks To Ride Out Market Volatility Now,opinion,Utilities provide customers with basic amenities like electricity  gas and water  Hence  the demand for these services hardly fluctuates  regardless of market volatilities  So what if there is a Brexit referendum  Will a U S  consumer curtail his or her electricity or water consumption because of a widely apprehended downturn  As the answer is an obvious No  so are investors assured of a steady return even in a turbulent global market condition Interest Rate Benefit to Continue These capital intensive utilities routinely take recourse to the capital markets to arrange for funds needed to upgrade and expand their infrastructure  The prevalent low interest rate scenario helps them to get the much needed funds on favorable conditions The referendum of the British people to leave the European Union has added more volatility to an already choppy global economy  Given the market turmoil  the Fed will be reluctant to alter rates in the second half of 2016  much to the favor of utilities The utilities will continue to enjoy the windfall from continued lower rates due to the economic uncertainty caused by Brexit Utilities Sector Price IndexDomestic Focus Reduces RiskWhile multi national U S  companies had to pay the price of slower than expected growth in the global economy  the domestic focused utilities consistently returned value to their investors this year  The Dow Jones Utility Average  DJU  is up 20 5  year to date  as of Jun 27  2016  compared with the S P 500 s return of down 2 2  over the same time frame The Brexit decision had a significant role to play here  wiping out the gains registered by the S P 500 so far this year  The key index lost nearly 5 6  over the last two trading sessions trigged by a Brexit induced sell off   On the other hand  DJU gained nearly 2 1  post Brexit Apart from the above factors  let s sum up other crucial points that make the utility sector an attractive choice for investors in times of heightened volatility   Steady Earnings Stream  The majority of utilities are governed by rates fixed by regulatory bodies of the states in which they operate  This ensures a steady earnings stream No Alternatives  The services provided by utilities do not have alternatives as we are yet to find any replacement for electricity or water   So  the utilities are assured of demand for their services irrespective of market turmoil Regular Dividend  Most of the utilities are regular dividend payers  Even if the stock price remains range bound and does not shoot up drastically  remaining invested in utilities provides investors with current income through regular dividend payments  Most of the utilities continued to pay dividends even during the height of the 2008 financial crisis 4 Stocks to Buy NowWe have picked four utilities boasting a Zacks Rank   2  Buy  and a  of either  A  or  B   In addition  these stocks are regular

time being  The markets have also bounced back after the post Brexit chaos  further consolidating their gains  The global stock market had wiped out  2 trillions of investor wealth in a single day  overshadowing the prior sell off record of  1 9 billion in Sep 2008 Though the markets are now a lot calmer  political and economic risks loom large due to uncertainties related to U K  s exit from the 28 nation bloc  Given the circumstances  investors would do well to add utility stocks to buttress their portfolio Prevalent Low Interest Rate a BoonFed interest rates greatly affect the utility sector because of its capital intensive nature  These companies have to incur significant debts to carry out infrastructure upgrade programs  The Fed s assurance that future interest rate increases will be gradual has helped the sector to benefit from a low rate scenario in the near term  as higher rates would have raised their financing costs and reduced their plea as dividend investments Another factor that must surely have played on risk averse investors  mind was the Brexit effect  Owing to the existing global turmoil arising from the  leave  vote  the Fed may be hesitant to alter rates in the second half of 2016  much to the favor of utilities Thus  utilities may continue to enjoy the windfall of lower rates due to the economic uncertainty caused by Brexit Zacks Industry Rank
