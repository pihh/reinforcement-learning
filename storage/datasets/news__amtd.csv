160311,381827,AMTD,JPMorgan lowers account minimum  expands free trades for You Invest,news,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK  Reuters    JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  said Thursday it is giving free online trades to more customers and lowering the amount of money needed to open one of its robo adviser accounts  as firms across the industry bow to pressure to reduce fees and account minimums 
The move means that people with as little as  500 can open a You Invest Portfolios account  and Chase customers who have at least  15 000 in their checking accounts or meet other key metrics can trade for free online and on the mobile app 
Kelli Keough  global head of digital wealth management at JPMorgan  said the bank lowered the barriers because it wants more Chase banking clients to be Chase investment clients 
It also comes about two months after the largest U S  online brokerage   Charles Schwab  Corp  K SCHW   eliminated commissions and fees for most online trades 
Schwab is reportedly exploring a merger with rival TD Ameritrade  O AMTD  in a bid to gain scale and more clients to support its new zero commission business model 
You Invest Portfolios  which launched in July  previously required investors to have at least  2 500 
You Invest Trade  which launched in 2018  previously offered free unlimited trades only to sapphire banking customers  who keep at least  75 000 in their accounts  and Chase private client customers  who keep at least  250 000  Private bank and securities division clients were also eligible for free trades 
Premier plus checking clients received 100 free trades a year 
Starting on Monday  Chase customers with premier plus can place unlimited free online stock  ETF and options trades  Anyone else who opens a new You Invest Trade account will get unlimited free trades for one year 
 We ve been seeing a nice uptake from our Chase client base   mostly younger and first time investors   Keough said by phone 
On average  she said  You Invest Trade investors are over 15 years younger than clients of other investing divisions at the bank

160313,381829,AMTD,Stocks Climb to Records Amid China  Deals Optimism  Markets Wrap,news," Bloomberg     U S  equities climbed to record highs after China said it will tighten intellectual property rules  a move aimed at boosting the chances of a trade deal between the two largest economies  The dollar was mixed 
The S P 500 and NASDAQ Composite Indexes climbed to all time highs after China said over the weekend it will raise penalties on intellectual property violations as it tries to smooth over a sticking point in talks  Adding to optimism was the multibillion dollar merger between   Charles Schwab   Corp   NYSE SCHW  and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp   NASDAQ AMTD

While doubts about the rally remain and haven investments such as bonds seem well supported  stocks globally are approaching a third month of gains  The S P 500 Index is building on an advance from Friday  when President Donald Trump said he was  very close  to a trade pact  even as Treasuries hold on to most of their two week surge 
 The markets are pretty much priced for a deal to go ahead  and that may be the case  but we may see that pushed out to 2020   Eleanor Creagh  market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets  told Bloomberg TV in Sydney   The key sticking point is really going to be the rolling back of tariffs

160411,381927,AMTD,Forex brokers eye U S  market as Trump vows to deregulate,news,"By Gertrude Chavez Dreyfuss and Dion Rabouin NEW YORK  Reuters    Retail currency brokers are considering operating in the United States after a nearly seven year absence  if President Donald Trump is able to carry through on his pledge to deregulate financial markets  The prospect of lighter regulations has revived interest in the country among foreign exchange brokers such as UFX and Alpari  which cater to small and individual investors  It has also brightened the outlook for an industry that has struggled and lost market share to places with looser regulations in Asia and Europe   Key players in the vast retail FX market are gearing up for a hopeful re entry   said Paul Sirani  chief market analyst  at online currency broker Xtrade in Limassol Cyprus  He declined to identify those retail FX players  Sirani s observation is shared by many market participants such as Javier Paz  senior analyst at research firm Aite Group  and Meir Velenski  a long time FX practitioner who set up his own financial consulting group  A return to the United States could mean physically setting up an office in the country as a U S  entity  or in some cases maintaining an overseas headquarters while soliciting business in the United States   At the heart of the forex brokers  optimism is the possible repeal of the Dodd Frank Act  Signed into law in 2010 in response to the global financial crisis  the Dodd Frank financial reform legislation aims to overhaul business practices on Wall Street and protect consumers  But its passage caused the demise of many U S  retail FX businesses  In 2006  there were 40 companies operating in the United States offering FX trading to retail customers  After Dodd Frank  that number has shrunk to three    GAIN Capital Holdings  Inc   O GCAP   Canada based Oanda  and TD Ameritrade  O AMTD   Under Dodd Frank rules  enforced by the CFTC  firms offering retail forex trading in the United States must maintain minimum capital of at least  20 million  plus 5 percent of the amount by which liabilities to retail forex customers exceed  10 million   By comparison  the minimum capital requirement in Cyprus  where many FX brokers have moved  range from 40 000 euros   42 680  to one million euros   1 067 million   Cyprus  with many FX brokers under its jurisdiction  has become popular with market participants because its European Union membership allows companies based in that country to provide FX services to other EU members   Dennis de Jong  managing director of retail forex trading firm UFX in Limassol  Cyprus  said he would  absolutely  be in favor of a move to the United States if the minimum capital requirement is reduced   Obviously the regulators need to be very strict in terms of how you protect the client    but in general lowering the  capital  threshold would be good   he added  The Trump administration has not said anything specific about FX regulation under Dodd Frank  But House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling said in a CNBC interview this week that much of the law could be undone through a number of ways   The  20 million bond required of U S  retail FX business pretty much precludes anyone from founding a start up in this business   said Joe Trevisani  chief market strategist  at WorldWide Markets  an online multi asset trading platform in Woodcliff  New Jersey  WorldWide Markets  regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in Britain  does not take U S  clients  Trevisani was a partner at currency broker FX Solutions  which exited the U S  market in 2013  a Dodd Frank casualty  Dodd Frank also prohibited FX overseas firms from soliciting U S  business   STANDBY POSITION  Russian currency broker Alpari  which left the United States in 2011 due to onerous regulations  is keen to see what happens with the new Trump administration   We are in standby position  Everybody is looking at the U S  right now for business and we re curious to see how things change   said Roberto d Ambrosio  chief executive officer at Alpari Research and Analysis Limited in London   D Ambrosio said Alpari s decision to return to the United States would hinge partly on easing regulations such as rules on forex reporting    The reporting requirement is really  really heavy   said the Alpari official  If the costs of reporting could be eased somewhat  then this would help  he added  SHRINKING U S  MARKET U S  retail FX trading volume has shrunk since Dodd Frank  data showed   In 2016  the U S  share of the  374 billion daily global retail currency trading volume has been cut in half to just 3 percent  or  11 billion  according to estimates from research firm Aite Group  Prior to Dodd Frank or in 2009  the U S  share was 6 percent  or  17 billion  of what was then a global daily retail market of  276 billion  Some market participants have pointed to the CFTC  Dodd Frank s regulator  as the culprit  Dodd Frank gave the CFTC regulatory powers to oversee the U S  retail FX sector  
 The CFTC could have created a safe environment in U S  retail FX by working more closely with the industry   said Aite s Paz in Salt Lake City  Utah ",2017-03-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/forex-brokers-eye-u.s.-market-as-trump-vows-to-deregulate-463403,463403

160437,381953,AMTD,Alibaba investors face lock up battered but largely unbowed,news,"By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK  Reuters    As  Alibaba   N BABA  was preparing to sell shares to U S  investors for the first time  Jerry Verseput tried to persuade his clients not to throw money at the giant China based e commerce company because he thinks IPOs are a gamble  especially those with a lot of hype    I said if you want to go play with the money  I will do it for you but understand this is for entertainment purposes and not an investment strategy   said Verseput  president of Veripax Financial Management in Folsom  California  who manages about  65 million  For the two clients that insisted on buying stock  Verseput made sure they only invested less than one percent of their assets in the IPO  That was probably good advice  Six months after Alibaba s IPO  the shares are down more than 29 percent from their November high  Alibaba opened on Sept  19 at  92 70  ended its first day at  93 89 and reached its peak on November 13  when it hit  120  The stock closed Tuesday at  84 50  about 24 percent above the  68 IPO price  Alibaba  which already commands 80 percent of the Chinese market and handles more ecommerce than Amazon  O AMZN  and eBay  O EBAY  combined  trades at a price to earnings ratio of about 30  compared with Seattle based Amazon  which sports a three digit P E  On Wednesday  a lock up period expires allowing insiders owning a total of 437 million Alibaba shares sell  A larger lock up of more than a billion shares held by insiders  including Yahoo  Inc  O YHOO  expires in September  Some investors are worrying about further drops in the stock as insiders sell  At TD Ameritrade  N AMTD   which typically serves retail investors  more than half of those who bought shares of Alibaba at the IPO still own the stock  while 24 percent sold within a month of buying   It s been ugly   said Alan Haft  a Newport  California based financial adviser who said he  shamefully went on CNBC touting the stock  before the IPO and talked about a dozen of his clients into buying it  He says he still sees a good long term picture for Alibaba  but not right away   The stock is probably going to get worse so in the short term it s a regret   While some anticipate a small drop in the stock price Wednesday as a result of the lockup  many analysts believe the end of the lockup has already been priced in  And given Alibaba s size  any selling will get absorbed easily  said Gil Luria  managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities  The 25 day average trading volume for Alibaba is 14 5 million shares  Still  the 437 million shares that go on sale on Wednesday exceed the 368 million it sold in the IPO  And some investors have come back down to earth after seeing its most recent quarterly results  While non GAAP net income  which strips out exceptional items  rose 25 percent to 13 12 billion yuan   2 1 billion  in the quarter ended December 2014  investors zeroed in on disappointing sales growth  revenue rose 40 percent from the previous year  down from a 53 7 percent gain in the September quarter   Alibaba s underwhelming holiday quarter performance and a public verbal tussle with a powerful Chinese industry regulator helped trigger the stock s decline  They brought to the fore two major risks to further gains   politics and the shift to mobile commerce  The lower than expected December quarter revenue underscored how Alibaba earns less on smartphones and tablets as its users shift toward mobile shopping  As of Feb 27  short interest in the stock came to almost 57 million shares  or 2 3 percent of Alibaba s outstanding stock  2 488 billion   That s more than double the 21 million shares as of Sept 30  when the Nasdaq began compiling data   Typically there is a lot of pent up anticipation around the expiration but history shows that a vast majority of times that anticipation doesn t manifest   said Adam Sarhan  chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York  who is short Alibaba shares   When the time comes for expiration you don t see a big decline in the stock unless if there is something fundamentally wrong or something has happened to change the investment thesis   Several of the biggest hedge fund managers  including Leon Cooperman s Omega Advisors  David Tepper s Appaloosa Management and Barry Rosenstein s Jana Partners LLC dissolved their stakes in Alibaba at the end of last year  while others reduced their holdings  according to U S  regulatory filings  Other money managers  like Haft  expect more rockiness in coming months  but think Alibaba will make them money   COUNTERFEIT QUESTION Alibaba s stock has taken a hit as Chinese regulators stepped up their scrutiny of counterfeit products on its ecommerce sites  In late January China s State Administration for Industry and Commerce issues a now retracted report accusing Alibaba for allowing the sale of fake products on its sites  among other things  However  Alibaba has ramped up its focus on identifying and removing counterfeits from its sites   I think in the longer term Alibaba is going to be a more credible company in the international market   Haft said   It will take another six months to a year for the stock to cycle back  but I think the fundamentals of the company are strong   September s lockup of 1 6 billion shares could have a bigger effect on the stock  but how much will depend on whether Alibaba has made significant progress on dealing with the counterfeiting issue  said Henry Guo  a senior analyst with Greenwich  Connecticut based JG Capital Corp  Robert H  Christie  an Alibaba spokesman  declined to comment  
As for Verseput s two clients  they re hanging on   They are thinking it s a big company and 20 years from now it should be a good investment   he said ",2015-03-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/alibaba-investors-face-lock-up-battered-but-largely-unbowed-332883,332883

160548,382064,AMTD,Retirement Ready  3 Stocks To Help Create A Steady  Passive Income Stream,opinion,"It s never a bad time to start preparing for your retirement  The reality in this perpetually low interest rate environment is that retirees need to have a good chunk of their portfolio tied to stocks to earn higher total returns 
Conservative investors who don t want to add too much risk to their portfolios will need to identify good quality stocks that have the ability to recover from downturns and still continue to provide a regular income 

In the dividend paying segment of the market  sometimes it makes sense to focus on what some traders may view as boring  old economy businesses  such as power and gas utilities  key infrastructure providers  and banks and insurance companies   companies that go on paying dividends through the thick and thin of the market 
1 Toronto Dominion Bank
Canadian banks are among the best dividend paying stocks in North America  What makes them different from their peers south of the border is less competition  a sound regulatory environment  and their diversification They operate in a kind of oligopoly where competition is limited  and the regulatory environment is extremely favorable for growth  Canada s top lenders have been very consistent in rewarding investors through steadily growing dividends  on which they spend about 40  50  of their income  In this group  I particularly like Toronto Dominion Bank  TSX TD   Canada s second largest lender  It has a very attractive dividend policy  supported by strong growth momentum  and a significant retail banking operation in the U S  Indeed  TD has more retail branches in the U S  than in Canada  with a network that stretches from Maine to Florida Overall  TD generates about 30  of its net income from its U S  retail operations  The bank also has a 42  ownership stake in TD Ameritrade  NASDAQ AMTD  with a fast expanding credit card portfolio After a 10 4  increase in its payout in February  income investors in TD stock now earn a  0 56 a share quarterly dividend  which translates into a 3 86  yield  The bank is forecast to grow its dividend payout between 7  and 10  each year going forward   an impressive growth rate at a time when the 10 year government note is yielding less than 1 69   TD stock  after gaining 16  this year  was trading at  57 68 at close yesterday 
2  Dow Inc 
The newly established Dow Inc  NYSE DOW   after its recent spin off from parent DowDuPont Inc   is offering a very attractive income generating opportunity for retirees 

Dow shares began trading on April 1 after the old  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  and DuPont  NYSE DD  announced a grand  120 billion merger in 2017  with an intention to create three separate entities  focusing on agricultural products and a specialty chemicals company 

The third one became Dow  entirely focusing on material sciences  plastics and silicones  What makes it a compelling income generating opportunity is the chemical producer s clear focus to return most of its income back to investors in the shape of dividends and share buybacks  According to the company s presentation to investors  the new Dow will pay out 65  of its net income to shareholders each year through stock buybacks and a hefty dividend 
Its stock currently pays  0 7 dividend a share  with an annual yield of about 5 8   With the targeted payout ratio of 45  of the company s net operating income  that dividend is quite conservative 




That said  investors should be aware that plastic  being a derivative of oil  is a cyclical business where demand and supply is closely tied to the global economic growth and other macro influences  That s the reason that its stock fell about 4  this year as trade fight between the U S  and China hurt demand for industrial products  Its stock closed yesterday at  47 91 
3  Enbridge Inc Utilities is another area where you can get a good income stream if you remain invested for the long run  North America s largest pipeline operator  Enbridge Inc  NYSE ENB  could be a good fit for your income generating portfolio  with its massive moat and its crucial position in North America s energy supply chain 
Enbridge is also a good defensive stock to hold on to when the economic headwinds are gathering pace  The company pays  0 55 a share quarterly dividend with an annual dividend yield of 6 28   The payout is expected to rise 10  per year as the company completes its many development projects and benefits from Canada s very tight pipeline capacity 
Over the past two years  Enbridge has been carrying out a restructuring plan  selling assets  focusing on its core strengths  and paying down its debt  These measures are likely to benefit long term investors whose aim is to earn steadily growing income 




Enbridge stock  up 13  to date in 2019  closed at  35 15 yesterday in New York

160631,382147,AMTD,Loan Growth To Support Regions Financial  RF  Q4 Earnings,opinion,Regions Financial   NYSE RF   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Jan 18  before the opening bell  The bank s results are estimated to reflect year over year rise in both revenues and earnings Also  the company has a decent earnings surprise history  It surpassed earnings in three of the preceding four quarters  coming up with average positive earnings surprise of 2 17  This Birmingham  AL based company s third quarter 2018 earnings compared favorably with the prior year quarter s earnings  recording 28  increase  Easing margin pressure and higher revenues were the positive factors  Moreover  credit quality recorded significant improvement  However  lower deposits balances were the undermining factors  In addition  expenses escalated in the quarter Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings remained unchanged at 38 cents over the last 60 days  reflecting a year over year improvement of nearly 40 7   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of  1 47 billion indicates around 1 3  growth from the prior year quarter In addition  Regions  results are expected to reflect a marginal rise  on a sequential basis  in average interest earning assets  with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter at  109 7 billion  Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Notably  the company s share price has depreciated post Q3 earnings  For the three month period ended Dec 31  2018  the stock has lost around 26 2  Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Regions  stock  This depends largely on whether or not the firm is able to post a beat in the fourth quarter Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsLoan Growth  A modest increase in lending   mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and consumer   is expected  However  weakness in revolving home equity loans  due to slowdown in originations as well as refinancing activities  will partially offset this In addition  management s expectations of loan growth in 2018 will likely be reflected in this quarter  The bank projects average loans to reflect year over year growth in low single digits  while average deposits are projected to remain relatively stable  excluding brokered and Wealth Institutional Services deposits Modest Rise in Net Interest Income  NII   A modest increase in lending is anticipated to have led to improvement in NII  Notably  flattening  and sometimes inversion of the yield curve during the Dec end quarter might have an unfavorable impact on net interest margin  Management s projections of the 2018 NII and other financing income s rise of 5 6  are likely to show impact in the quarter under review  Based on market conditions  loan growth  rate increase in December and modest increase in deposit costs  continuation of recent growth trends in net interest income  and a 3 5 basis point expansion of net interest margin are expected Non Interest Income Might Escalate  The persistent decline in non interest income has weighed on the top line in the last few years  Fixed income trading revenues are expected to remain muted on a year over year basis due to challenging trading environment during the quarter  The trend of consumer spending was strong during the Oct Dec quarter  which will likely have bolstered the bank s credit and debit card revenues  However  poor mortgage banking revenues during the quarter are anticipated to have offset the positives to some extent  Nevertheless  adjusted non interest income is estimated to be up 4 5 5 5  in 2018 Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for capital market revenues is estimated to climb 13 3  sequentially to  51 million  while commercial credit fee income is projected to be up marginally to  18 2 million Expenses Might Rise Slightly  Regions  bottom line is expected to reflect the decent support of its efficient expense management during the quarter to be reported  Notably  the company is on track for a  400 million expense reduction by 2019  While investing in revenue generating areas  the company intends to keep expenses stable Here is what our quantitative model predicts Regions does not have the right combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP is currently pegged at  0 52  Zacks Rank  Regions  carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise   Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider  as according to our model  these have the right combination of elements

160672,382188,AMTD,Goldman Sachs Trading Below Tangible Book Value,opinion,"Banking giant Goldman Sachs Group  NYSE GS  has slipped below tangible book value on worries over the yield curve  1MDB and the ongoing correction in the US equity market 
2018 has been a tough year for Financials  which will be addressed in another post shortly  but for now  Goldman trading below  186 brings the white shoe firm below tangible book value  TBV  and might start to be of interest to readers 
Taking a quick look at forward earnings and revenue estimates  Goldman is trading at 7x  the expected 2019 and 2020 estimates of  25 61 and  27 66  with EPS expected to grow 1  and 8   while revenue is expected to grow 1  and 3  respectively   Consensus estimates from IBES by Refinitiv  
Buybacks
One interesting note is that Goldman said it was going to cut back on share repurchases in terms of capital return for the year  but in Q3  18  Goldman returned  1 2 billion in capital to shareholders via buybacks  It makes sense to buy back shares at these price levels  below tangible book value 
Technically the stock is trading below the previous lows from 2018 and 2017 so that s not a plus  2016 lows from Q1  16  which was the last decent correction we had in the markets  saw GS hit  135    139  It s doubtful the stock would get anywhere close to that level though 
Bottom Line
Goldman is still a world class franchise in the Financial sector but maybe not the one for longer term investors  The banking business could be slowly disintermediated away as emerging tech companies might choose to go public via crowd funding or dutch auctions  just as Spotify  NYSE SPOT  did  The global investment banking business is subject to the same  creative destruction  forces as any other business 
The emphasis over the next 3   5 years will likely be on asset management for Goldman  Getting more of its high net worth clients share of wallet and client lending will likely be an important business segment for Goldman in the next 5 years 
It surprised me to read that of Schwab  NYSE SCHW   Ameritrade  NASDAQ AMTD   Goldman and Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Schwab had more assets under management than the other three while Goldman had the least 
In the next few days and weeks  I might take a shot at Goldman on the long side for a trade  The stock was last sold at  244    245  Goldman s valuation is getting too cheap although 1MDB remains a wild card 
What s I d like to see in terms of trading action is the stock in the green on an otherwise red day for the tape and other Financials  Some other technicians think  160    170 is the right area to own GS 
On Tuesday  Goldman was down 3  on slightly heavier volume than average 
Thanks for reading 
 Again  I may or may not do anything on the stock in terms of trading it for accounts  If the opportunity is there on the long side and the stars align  GS is worth the trade  The valuation is what is interesting  ",2018-12-04,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/goldman-sachs-trading-below-tangible-book-value-200364995,200364995

160760,382276,AMTD,Why Is TD Ameritrade  AMTD  Down 1  Since The Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation   NASDAQ AMTD    Shares have lost about 1  in that time frame  outperforming the market 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is AMTD due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts TD Ameritrade Q1 Earnings   Revenues Beat EstimatesTD Ameritrade recorded a positive earnings surprise of 56 9  in first quarter fiscal 2018  ending Dec 31   The company reported earnings of 80 cents per share  significantly beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents  Moreover  results were up 86  from the prior year quarter The quarter displayed higher revenues and elevated expenses  Rise in net interest margin  NIM  was also recorded  Notably  the company recorded an increase in average client trades per day  indicating improvement in trading activity Including certain non recurring items  net income for the quarter came in at  297 million or 52 cents per share compared with  216 million or 41 cents reported in the prior year quarter Rise in Revenues Offset Escalating ExpensesNet revenues for the quarter came in at  1 26 billion  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 2 billion  Moreover  net revenues surged 46 3  year over year  The rise was chiefly due to higher transaction based as well as asset based revenues Total asset based revenues for the quarter amounted to  790 million  up 61 2  year over year  driven by higher insured deposit account fees  as well as investment product fees and net interest revenues Commissions and transaction fees climbed 23 9  from the prior year quarter to  440 million  Further  the quarter s NIM came in at 1 71   expanding 39 basis points year over year Total operating expenses flared up 82  year over year to  921 million  The rise mainly stemmed from increase in a number of expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  professional services  occupancy and equipment costs  and other expenses Trading Activity ImprovedAverage client trades per day for the reported quarter increased 49  year over year to 726 000 As of Dec 31  2017  net new client assets totaled  26 5 billion  up 9  year over year  Total client assets came in at  1 2 trillion  up 48  year over year Average spread based balance was  150 7 billion  jumping 28  year over year  and average fee based investment balance was up 35  to  230 billion Balance Sheet PositionAs of Dec 31  2017  TD Ameritrade s cash and cash equivalents were  1 6 billion compared with  1 5 billion reported as of Sep 30  2017  Shareholders  equity was  7 4 billion compared with  7 2 billion as of Sep 30  2017 OutlookThe company updated its outlook for fiscal 2018  which includes projected GAAP earnings of  1 85  2 45 per share and non GAAP earnings of  2 55  3 05 per share  Updated outlook reflects the new U S  tax legislation Management expects to realize synergies of  175  225 million in fiscal 2018 from the Scottrade acquisition Full year 2018 effective tax rate is expected to be about 22   Also  in 2019  the company expects tax rate to be 24  The company expects certain expenses to increase in second quarter fiscal 2018  due to incremental investments in advertising incentives and client service personnel to address the high levels of client engagement  Further  it expects expenses to decline in the last two quarters of the fiscal year on the back of clearing conversion

160761,382277,AMTD,How To Collect  7 322 In Payouts Next Month  On Just  500k   ,opinion,"Last month  I handpicked a four pack of dividend growers for a select group of subscribers  On the surface  our February mini portfolio had an impressive pedigree  It yielded 2 2  annually and boasted 21  dividend growth 
But I was challenged with a task taller than simply buying and hoping for gains  These readers not only wanted their dividends   they wanted them paid monthly 
And they weren t going to settle for 0 2  per month  No  they demanded meaningful monthly income on a modest portfolio   I ll use  500 000 for our real life example   but you don t need this much to employ this strategy  A  50 000 stake will work just as well  
If you earn 0 2  per month on  500K  you have  1 000 in monthly income while you wait for your stocks to go up  That s better than nothing  but it s certainly not enough to live off of  We need to do two things to improve this cash flow 

Accelerate these dividends 
And 

Collect our payouts monthly 

In other words  we need to take the modest current yield and turn that into a much larger yearly return  Like this 
Trading 2 2  Yields for 31  Yearly Payouts 
Let me walk through each example so that you can see exactly what we did to generate  7 322 in cash last month  We set aside  500 000  but we didn t actually have to buy a stock at any point  And we closed the month with no active positions  which means we now have  507 322 in cash that we can redeploy this month using the same strategy 
Step 1  Collect 5 Dividend Payments From the Wall Street Strip
If you view Wall Street as a giant casino  you ll like this trade  We collected a quick  insurance payment  on one of the beautiful buildings lining the Strip 
For our purposes  the physical property is a website  and accompanying mobile app  with a captive  growing stock trading audience  TD Ameritrade  NASDAQ AMTD  was highly ranked by Barron s in its yearly grading of online brokers  The firm continues to grow client assets  quickly approaching one trillion dollars 
TD Approaches  1 Trillion 
Investor assets parked in AMTD s stock are  in turn  treated to higher dividends  The firm recently hiked its payout by 16 7  to  0 84 per share  a 1 5  forward yield  
With momentum on AMTD s side  it was a great time to draft behind this stock   and safely pick up Wall Street s  spare change  for a cash payment worth nearly five quarterly dividend payments 
We had two choices 

Buy AMTD outright and collect our first  0 21 per share dividend payment in May 
Or 

Sell puts below AMTD s current price to collect  1 15 per share immediately 

It was an obvious choice  We sold the puts  banked the premiums and never had to actually buy any shares  the options we sold expired worthless last weekend   which is great for us as sellers  

Note  Contracts are sold or bought in lots of 100 shares 
Also  the  cash set aside  is simply that   money that we save just in case we need to purchase these shares  It sits in our account as cash alongside the cash we just received for selling these contracts 
We generated  2 530 on a  125 000 cash pile  And these puts eventually expired worthless   which means we earned this income without having to actually buy any shares 
We didn t wait for options expiration to make our next move  however  The following week  we made another low risk high reward trade 
Step 2  Riding Rising Rates for 29  Yearly Returns
SunTrust Banks  NYSE STI  had been doing a fine job accelerating its own dividend over the past five years ago  It made sense for us to combine forces 
Higher interest rates are  naturally  boosting the bank s net interest income  NII   SunTrust earned  1 43 billion in NII in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus  1 34 billion the same time period in 2016   a gain of 6 7   That s a nice raise for doing nothing 
The firm s shareholders are used to kicking back and making more money year after year  too  They received a 53  dividend increase last summer  and are looking forward to another generous hike before they wrap up this summer s vacation 
So we tapped SunTrust s dividend stream as well   for more money than the regular quarterly distribution  paid faster  too  We accelerated this 2 2  annual dividend to 29  simply by selling puts comfortably below the current price 
The stock grinded higher in the ensuing weeks  and we banked our generous premium payout free and clear 

Step 3  22  Yearly Income From a Tech Cash Clow
The following week we considered Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   an old school tech company that continues to reinvent itself while harvesting boatloads of cash from its legacy businesses  The firm is a digital utility for the Internet  collecting money from a host of related businesses including infrastructure platforms  software applications  security products and consulting services 
Investors are always fretting about the firm s growth prospects   but you d never guess it by looking at Cisco s results 
The company is wisely transitioning many of its products to subscription models 
Recurring revenue now accounts for 33  of the firm s total sales  It also has  5 5 billion in  deferred product revenue  that it will be collecting in coming years as these subscriptions renew  The company is quietly turning itself into an internet powered annuity 
Shareholders will receive their new and improved payout of  0 33 per share for the first time in early April  But we did even better without actually holding shares 
We  front ran  this dividend payment and collected  0 41 over just two weeks 

Meanwhile  we turned our attention to our fourth and final trade of the month 
Step 4  Uncovering Free Cash for a Final Quick Payout
On the surface  Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC  2 1  dividend looks dicey  The firm hadn t hiked its payout in three years while its payout ratio  percentage of paper profits it pays as dividends  has spiked above 100  
But these headline numbers are misleading because WDC s cash payout ratio  based on free cash flow  or FCF  is actually quite conservative 
Cash Ratio of 16  Shows Stock is Due for a Dividend Hike  
Here s the actual  tale of the cash tape  for WDC 

The firm could double its dividend tomorrow and still boast a modest one third cash payout ratio 
When will shareholders receive their overdue raise  We didn t care  We option sellers can collected half of the company s yearly dividend in a short 8 days 
 Once again  without actually having to buy shares  

All four of the option contracts we sold above expired worthless  That was perfect for us as sellers  It means our  500 000 portfolio has grown  it s still in all cash and it s ready for redeployment this week   Tomorrow to be specific  
Four Simple  Low Risk Trades Earned Us  7 322  Note  For a  50 000 portfolio  just move the decimal points above one step to the left  
How To Bank  7 322 in Payouts Next Month  and Every Month After 
I know many investors who  want to learn  how to do this  They know that others are doing well with options  but they re not sure how to go from buying and selling stocks and funds to buying and selling options 
Here s a secret   they re almost exactly the same  And you probably have the ability to do it already from your online brokerage account 
Plus  now is the time to insulate your portfolio from a potential pullback  Stop buying and hoping   and start generating monthly cash flow  with lower risk to boot   via dividend acceleration

160904,382420,AMTD,TD Says Goodbye to Commission Free Vanguard ETFs,opinion,"TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation  NASDAQ AMTD  roiled the investment community this week when it announced it was shaking up its commission free ETF lineup across its entire brokerage platform  The highlights include an expanded number of funds available to trade and fewer restrictions on eligible accounts  They also dropped Morningstar as the advisor that selects the commission free list  giving in house management more control over which funds make the cut 
This type of expansive announcement is typically met with great enthusiasm by the advisor community  However  the biggest bombshell is that they are no longer offering Vanguard ETFs on their commission free list  Yeah  you heard me right NO VANGUARD 
 gasp 
Many consider it an unpardonable sin in this day and age to omit Vanguard from your preferred vendor list  It s just not done under any circumstances and likely has many professionals thinking about how they are going to spin this angle to their clients 
This decision was likely due to a strategic business edict  Brokerage companies strike deals with certain fund companies to cover marketing costs and participate in revenue sharing models  Vanguard clearly didn t fit into the picture  didn t want to participate  or was excluded based on competitive reasons 
The important thing to remember is that Vanguard is the face of the index fund movement  but they are not the only game in town  There are many solid fund providers out there that offer identical offerings at the same or cheaper expense ratios  You may not get every single index flavor that you had previously  but I would bet that you can find some very solid replacements in the  
Headlining that list is a lineup of broad based  portfolio  funds from State Street  the SPDR brand  that have extremely minimal expenses  All the traditional market cap and sector segments are represented  in addition to a few funds that you may not have known existed  It s worth combing through some of these fresh faces to see how they match up to some of the funds you currently own 
My biggest concern with the SPDR portfolio series is the relatively light trading volume  Advisors who trade in size need to ensure they are using limit orders to get rock solid pricing  It s likely that the natural pull of assets and attention to these funds will gradually ramp this up over time  but for now  it s going to be a small risk factor that must be managed 
The good news is that there is still a strong BlackRock  iShares  presence in the new list that contains well known factor ETFs based on quality  momentum  volatility  and international indexes  These can be used for both core or tactical exposure depending on your investment style and have established asset bases with strong liquidity pools 
New to the commission free platform are the big smart beta players from the likes of WisdomTree  First Trust  JP Morgan  PowerShares  and ProShares  This is where things start to get a little murky for me 
You must be extremely discerning in evaluating the efficacy of these more complex fund strategies  They generally come with higher embedded fees  more concentrated portfolios  and varying risk dynamics than more simplistic index funds  Some can be truly fantastic  but you must weed through a wall of nonsense to find the diamonds in the rough 
The Bottom Line
TD Ameritrade touts nearly 300 funds on the new commission free list  But let s be realistic  there are probably 100 good funds and 200 that would make my  never trade  list  Two thirds can be thrown in the incinerator and you would not miss them 
The loss of Vanguard is conspicuous  but a bug that can be easily overcome with a little creativity on the part of your portfolio manager  even if that is you   Additionally  if you are so in love with Vanguard that you MUST own their funds  just pay the  6 95 trading fee  They haven t been banished into permanent exile  They just aren t free to trade at TD Ameritrade starting in November 
Rather than bemoan the decision makers behind this change  I am opting to focus on the fresh opportunities that are being presented to us  Looking at this from a glass half full standpoint will ensure I m ready to make the right trades with the  when the timing presents itself  I urge you to do the same

Will The FED Kill The Bull Market Rally 
The FED will continue to keep  loose  monetary policy  indefinitely  as they do not want to repeat their mistakes of 2000 and 2006  The markets believe that President Trump will create a new economic  miracle   Implementing new fiscal initiatives is the next and last option to implement 
I believe that Infrastructure Spending will be the new asset class to invest in for the future  A rate hike this month of an  immaterial  25 basis points does not change the BIG picture that the FED will lower all three of these  immaterial  hikes down the road or even go directly into the markets and purchase stocks and bonds on the next major downturn 
Federal Chairwoman Yellen and Company is under pressure to do some face saving  This is not an indication by them to push ahead with any material future FED FUNDS RATE hikes  This Federal Funds rate hike is already factored into all of the markets today  It is much to do about nothing

Federal government current expenditures  Interest payments

160987,382503,AMTD,Dual Momentum  November Update,opinion,"Scott s Investments provides a free  Dual ETF Momentum  spreadsheet  which was originally created in February 2013  The strategy was inspired by a paper written by Gary Antonacci and available on Optimal Momentum  Antonacci s book  Dual Momentum Investing  An Innovative Strategy for Higher Returns with Lower Risk  also details Dual Momentum as a total portfolio strategy 
My Dual ETF Momentum spreadsheet is available  and the objective is to track four pairs of ETFs and provide an  Invested  signal for the ETF in each pair with the highest relative momentum  Invested signals also require positive absolute momentum  hence the term  Dual Momentum  
Relative momentum is gauged by the 12 month total returns of each ETF  The 12 month total returns of each ETF is also compared to a short term Treasury ETF  a  cash  filter  in the form of iShares Barclays 1 3 Treasury Bond ETF  NYSE SHY   In order to have an  Invested  signal the ETF with the highest relative strength must also have 12 month total returns greater than the 12 month total returns of SHY  This is the absolute momentum filter which is detailed in depth by Antonacci  and has historically helped increase risk adjusted returns 
An  average  return signal for each ETF is also available on the spreadsheet  The concept is the same as the 12 month relative momentum  However  the  average  return signal uses the average of the past 3  6  and 12   3 6 12   month total returns for each ETF  The  invested  signal is based on the ETF with the highest relative momentum for the past 3  6 and 12 months  The ETF with the highest average relative strength must also have an average 3 6 12 total returns greater than the 3 6 12 total returns of the cash ETF 
Portfolio123 was used to test a similar strategy using the same portfolios and combined momentum score   3 6 12    The test results were posted  
Below are the four portfolios along with current signals 

The Dual ETF Momentum spreadsheet also has four additional sheets using a dual momentum strategy with broker specific commission free ETFs for TD Ameritrade  NASDAQ AMTD   Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW   Fidelity and Vanguard  It is important to note that each broker may have additional trade restrictions and the terms of their commission free ETFs could change in the future ",2016-11-11,Scott's Investments,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dual-momentum-november-update-200164064,200164064

161105,382621,AMTD,U S  Stocks Remain In Uptrend,opinion,"Investor Focused Market Analysis
The S P 500 index  US Stock Market  continues to be in and Uptrend 
The major trend line on the chart below must be broken in a big way before a full blown bear market will be confirmed  This is still months away at best so do not worry  The AlgoTrades INNER Market Analysis will get us positioned when the time is right and enable us to profit as the stock market falls in value 
Your long term equity investments can continue to be held at this point  Speculative and momentum stocks  Russell 2000  continue to show weakness  so I would stay away from them  Large cap stocks will likely be in favor as the safe haven  blue chip  stocks  but when the market is ready to roll over  all stocks will fall  The safe haven plays should be bonds  gold and inverse ETF funds 
We do fear a US dollar currency crisis  and if so investors will be moving away from US investments and the massive bond bubble may burst  But at this time  it is not a concern 

Chart   BIGGER PICTURE
This chart I feel provides a great perspective on the overall market trend and price patterns  This is the 70 year prospective  I hope something like this unfolds  Fingers crossed to a 12 month correction bear market  This will build the new base for the next super cycle 
US Dollar has now reached the upper resistance trend line    we could see weakness in the dollar going forward   

The Risk Off Trade Is Slowly Unfolding
The S P 500 index is losing its momentum  Money has been rotating into Bonds and global markets for a year in anticipation of the stock market correcting 
With six months of the S P 500 index trading sideways we have had to focus on some other areas to find opportunities  Some recent winners have been long oil with  ARCA UCO   long live cattle with  NYSE COW   long Russia via  NYSE RSX  and long Japan with  NYSE EWJ   Those who follow my ETF trade alerts newsletter have avoided the recent chatter in the S P 500  We have be doing even better with our active stock trades 

The Fear Index   Big Trend Analysis
The VIX index has been trading at low levels for a few years  This suggests that fear is low  complacency is high  and that S P 500 is becoming vulnerable to a stock market correction 
In the chart below  I have placed the VIX index above the stocks trading above the 200 day moving average  As the number of stocks trading above the 200 day moving average falls it s telling us that fewer stocks are moving up in value while the broad market climbs  This is bearish 
This provides a great visual of how falling markets correlate with investor fears  While overall market breadth remains strong  a change in the VIX often provides an early warning sign of potential danger 
 When The VIX Is Low It s Time to Go  When The VIX Is High It s Time To Buy 

Stock Market Rises with Fewer Stocks   RED FLAG
Since mid 2014 the US stock market has become move volatile  Fewer stocks participating in the markets move up  This can be seen by comparing the percent of stocks trading above their 200 day moving average and the S P 500 index 
When a stock market stalls  which is what it appears to be doing  the movement is comparable to that of how an aircraft stalls  It slowly continues to rise  things become choppy unstable  then it drops and picks up speed trying to regain stability and control 
Once the stock market or an aircraft come to a complete stall they both end with a violent drop  While I am not calling a top yet  understand each month we are getting closer 
An analyst and trader I respect talked about how the Dow Jones is flat for the the year  yet investors think big profits are bing made  But in reality we have not seen real gains and the broad market expand in months  More investors are bullish now than we have almost ever seen according to Investors Intelligence Survey with a whopping 57  of investors bullish on stocks 
The CEO of Ameritrade  NYSE AMTD  said that almost all of their 6 million traders investor account are completely invested in stocks  and are leveraged using margin also  This is the ultimate contrarian warning sign of a bear market should begin over the next few months 

INNER Investor Monthly Conclusion 
The great thing about being an investor is that the analysis and trends move relatively slow  We do not buy at the dead low  nor do we exit at the high  and sometimes we get shaken up during tough phases in the market like the second half of 2014 and first half of 2015 
I ll be honest  the second half of 2014 and first portion of 2015 has been exceptionally tough to generate profits 
Winning streaks  and losing streaks are just part of investing and it happens to everyone and every strategy as the market has difference market phases and characteristics 
I believe the second half 2015 is will provide great opportunities and we will close the year out with decent gains ",2015-05-07,Chris Vermeulen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-stocks-remain-in-uptrend-251014,251014
161109,382625,AMTD,Dual ETF Momentum October Update,opinion,"Scott s Investments provides a free  Dual ETF Momentum  spreadsheet  which was originally created in February 2013  The strategy was inspired by a paper written by Gary Antonacci and available on Optimal Momentum 
My Dual ETF Momentum spreadsheet is available and the objective is to track four pairs of ETFs and provide an  Invested  signal for the ETF in each pair with the highest relative momentum  Invested signals also require positive absolute momentum  hence the term  Dual Momentum  
Relative momentum is gauged by the 12 month total returns of each ETF  The 12 month total returns of each ETF is also compared to a short term Treasury ETF  a  cash  filter  in the form of iShares Barclays 1 3 Treasury Bond ETF  N SHY   In order to have an  Invested  signal  the ETF with the highest relative strength must also have 12 month total returns greater than the 12 month total returns of SHY  This is the absolute momentum filter  which is detailed in depth by Antonacci  and has historically helped increase risk adjusted returns 
An  average  return signal for each ETF is also available on the spreadsheet  The concept is the same as the 12 month relative momentum  However  the  average  return signal uses the average of the past 3  6  and 12   3 6 12   month total returns for each ETF  The  invested  signal is based on the ETF with the highest relative momentum for the past 3  6 and 12 months  The ETF with the highest average relative strength must also have an average 3 6 12 total returns greater than the 3 6 12 total returns of the cash ETF 
Portfolio123 was used to test a similar strategy using the same portfolios and combined momentum score   3 6 12    The test results were posted in the 2013 Year in Review and the January 2015 Update 
Below are the four portfolios along with current signals 

As an added bonus  the spreadsheet also has four additional sheets using a dual momentum strategy with broker specific commission free ETFs for TD Ameritrade  N AMTD   Charles Schwab  N SCHW   Fidelity  N FNF   and Vanguard  It is important to note that each broker may have additional trade restrictions and the terms of their commission free ETFs could change in the future ",2015-10-12,Scott's Investments,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dual-etf-momentum-october-update-267854,267854
161134,382650,AMTD,Will AmEx Miss Earnings Estimates ,opinion,"American Express Co   NYSE AXP   AmEx  is scheduled to release its first quarter 2014 financial results after the closing bell on Apr 16  Let s have a look at the company s earnings prediction right before the announcement 
What Sort of Surprise 
Our proven model shows that AmEx is unlikely to beat earnings as it lacks the required combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  AmEx has a negative Zacks ESP  That is because Expected Surprise Prediction or Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of  1 29 per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 30  is  0 8  
Zacks Rank  AmEx has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with Zacks Rank  1  2 and 3 have significantly higher chances of beating earnings  Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  are kept under the radar and are never considered going into the earnings announcement  
The combination of AmEx s Zacks Rank  3 and  0 8  ESP deter us from being convinced as to whether earnings will beat or miss expectations on Apr 16 
What is Directing Indifferent Earnings 
AmEx benefits from improved credit trends  new business initiatives  strong capital ratios and return on equity  ROE  as well as stable ratings  The positivity is backed by a trailing four quarter average surprise beat of 2 6   although the fourth quarter 2013 generated a negative surprise of 0 8  due to higher litigation costs 
Meanwhile  lower borrowing on cards along with rising payment of outstanding debt may likely raise interest expense and impede growth of loan fee income  thereby hampering the top line  Although the company is keeping expenses in check  the impact of regulations and lawsuits and higher loan loss provisions  given lower lending reserves  raises potential risks 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this coming quarter
