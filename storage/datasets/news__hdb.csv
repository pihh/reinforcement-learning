Ladies and gentlemen  good evening  and welcome to HDFC Bank Earnings Conference Call on the Financial Eesults for the Quarter Ended 31 December 2019  presented by Mr  Srinivasan Vaidyanathan  Chief Financial Officer 
We also have with us Mr  Sashi Jagdishan  Group Head and Change Agent of the bank  Mr  Jimmy Tata  Chief Risk Officer  and Mr  Rahul Shyam Shukla  Group Head  Wholesale and Business Banking  on this call   Operator Instructions 
I now hand the conference over to Mr  Srinivasan Vaidyanathan  Thank you  and over to you  sir 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Okay  Thank you  Aman  Good evening to all  Appreciate the participants calling in today  We ll get to the results relating for the quarter and also for the nine months ended December 31  2019 
Let s start with net revenues  Net revenues grew by 19 1   broadly driven by an advances growth of 19 9   deposits growth of 25 2  and other income growth of 35 5   Net interest income for the quarter was INR14 173 crores  and the net interest margin remained at 4 2  
The bank s average liquidity coverage ratio increased to 140  in Q3 from 133  in Q2  in line with the strategy to continue to build on deposits  thereby strengthening the liquidity position further  While the excess liquidity positions the bank to get into potential loan demand in the future  it impacts current NIM by around 10 basis points to 20 basis points  Again  as we have mentioned in the last quarter  this drag was offset by monetizing some of the investments in the form of trading gains  which essentially makes the year on year NII growth at about 18  or so 
Moving on to the details of other income  Fees and commission income  constituting roughly two thirds of other income  grew by 24  over the previous year to reach INR4 527 crores  Of this  retail constitutes approximately 93  and wholesale constitutes 7   FX and derivatives income grew by 32 1  over previous year to reach INR526 crores  The growth was granular in nature  being driven by retail customers who contributed about two thirds of the total 
Trading income was INR677 crores  As mentioned earlier  this represents the current ALCO strategy of monetizing some of the gains from the excess liquidity investments  Other miscellaneous income of INR940 crores  includes certain one off recoveries arising from the resolution of NCLT matter  which is approximately INR200 crores  and dividend from subsidiaries 
Operating expenses for the quarter were INR7 897 crores  an increase of 17 5  over the previous year  We had the Facilities Program running through the quarter  This program was  for most part  a consolidation of several disparate and localized programs that we ran in the previous years  The one bank satellite approach brought in dealers  retailers  merchants  manufacturers partnership  leading to efficient execution of the programs  and it entailed some marginal incremental costs 
Year on year  we added 382 banking outlets  70 added in the quarter  242 added year to date  1 126 ATM  cash deposits and withdrawal machines were added  And we also added 3 421 business correspondents  BCs  managed by Common Service Centres  The staff count increased by 2 773 during the quarter and 17 556 during the last 12 months 
Cost to income ratio was at 38  and has remained in a stable rate compared to the prior year and prior quarter after absorbing the investment in branches  people and technology 
Moving on to PPOP  The pre provision operating profit grew by 20 1  to INR12 945 crores from INR10 778 crores in the prior year 
Getting to asset quality  GNPA ratio was at 1 42  of gross advances  as compared to 1 38  in the prior quarter and prior year  GNPA ratio  excluding NPAs in the agricultural segment was at 1 2  in the current as well as prior quarter and 1 1  in the prior year  Net NPA ratio was at 0 48  of net advances  as compared to 0 42  in the preceding quarter and previous year 
Annualized core slippage ratio was at 1 7  in the current quarter as well as prior year and prior quarter here  The current quarter slippage includes one off large ticket amounts  This as well as agri have been excluded in the core slippage ratio  The coverage ratio was at 67   as against coverage ratio of 70  in the prior year  Including contingent provisions  the coverage ratio is about 78   There are no technical write offs included anywhere  Our head office and branch books  Phonetic  are fully integrated 
At the end of current quarter  contingent provisions toward loans were at INR1 457 crores  The bank s floating provisions remained at INR1 451 crores as of December 31  2019  And general provisions were at INR4 131 crores  Total provisions comprising specific  floating  contingent and general were 119  of the gross non performing loans as on December 31  2019  in addition to the security held as collateral in several of of the cases 
Now getting to provisions  The total provisions were INR3 044 crores  as against INR2 701 crores during the prior quarter and INR2 212 crores on the prior year  Total provisions in the current quarter included one offs of approximately INR700 crores primarily relating to certain corporate accounts as well as accelerated portions of some accounts  including those accounts in the resolution plan process    some of you    and it includes some agri  Some of you may want to know the names of these large and other    and one off names  As has been our policy and practice  we will not talk about the names now or even in the Q A section 
Core specific loan loss provision  i e   excluding these one offs were INR2 174 crores  as against INR2 038 crore during the prior quarter and INR1 735 crores of the prior year 
Now coming to credit cost ratios  The core credit cost ratio  i e   specific loan loss ratio excluding one offs as mentioned earlier  was stable at 0 92  of the advances  as against 0 90  for the prior quarter and 0 88  for the prior year  As you are aware  recoveries are recorded as miscellaneous income  Therefore  the core credit cost ratios net of recoveries and excluding one offs were stable at 0 66   as compared to 0 68  in the prior quarter and 0 69  in the prior year 
PAT and PBT  the reported profit before tax was at INR9 902 crore  Adjusted for one off credit items  the core profit before tax at INR10 402 crore grew by approximately 21 4   As you are aware  the tax rates were lower during the year  This change was already implemented by us in prior quarter  Net profits for the quarter grew by 32 8  to INR7 416 crore  Net profit for the nine months ended December 31  2019  was at INR19 330 crore  up by 27 2  over the corresponding nine months of the previous year

Let s hear a few comments on the wholesale advances from our corporate and business banking head  Rahul Shukla 
Rahul Shukla    Group Head Corporate Banking   Business Banking
Thank you  Srini  Good evening  all  Both our corporate banking and business banking businesses had an above trend performance during the quarter  While yields have been impacted in the marketplace  more so in large corporates  NIMs have continued to hold up  helped also by reduction in funding costs  Both businesses have seen greater customer liability that accretes  Phonetic  to us for very different reasons  in comparison to the marketplace 
In our business banking vertical  we saw a pickup in credit demand from existing customers since the last week of November  During the prior period  existing customer accounts have seen a drop in overdrafts due to release of GST cash flows by the government or lack of requirement owing to softer growth  However  there is now a pickup in credit demand  The broad pickup was seen in Punjab  in Southern India  Central India and Eastern India  Trends in Gujarat and some adjoining regions have remained soft  We expect that to pick up in this particular quarter 
We also saw accelerated new to bank acquisitions last quarter on the bank of our    on the back of our digital offering  especially in semi urban and rural locations  helped also by our district expansion initiatives  with record disbursements in November and December  Our business did well on customer liabilities  as we now have a near term line of sight to a fully funded  self funded business 
Delinquencies to date were within internally budgeted levels and below comparable period last year  more than majority of this book classified as being PSL compliant for us  Our corporate banking business benefited from strong client support  We saw broad based growth in this quarter across our public sector client base  and also across sectors such as material  energy  agriculture and allied activities  including fertilizer  power  discretionary consumer  etc 
Our focus on up tiering smaller clients continued to show positive momentum and helping us with diversification  We continue to support our corporate backed  MNC backed  PS backed and FI and bank backed NBFC clients  This lending also supported our PSL effort given the change in RBI guidelines  which was very helpful 
Our drive toward measuring and increasing our penetration showed positive results  with digital host to host integration with our clients continuing to be very helpful on the liability side  Working capital cycles have remained normal in this quarter for our clients  while overall capex has increased somewhat 
Thank you  Srini  and handing back to you 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Okay  Thank you  Rahul  Now let s move on to capex  With regards to capital adequacy  total CAR as per Basel III guidelines stood at 18 5   as against the regulatory requirement of 11 075   In December 2018  capital adequacy was at 17 3   Tier 1 CAR was 17 1  in the current quarter as compared to 16 2  in the prior quarter and 15 8  in prior year  CET1 capital stood at 16 2  in the current quarter compared to 14 9  in the previous year 
Now some business update  During the year  we added 242 banking outlets  as I mentioned before  taking our total network to 5 345 banking outlets  Including the banking correspondents  i e   3 421 BCs managed by the CSCs  the total banking outlets were at 8 766  66  of these outlets are in semi urban and rural areas 
As of this quarter end  we have signed approximately 1 3 lakh Common Service Centres village level entrepreneurs  of which 86 000 are onboarded as business facilitators  Of these  around 41  are actively sourcing  The monthly run rate of products sourced by CSCs have progressed to approximately 70 000 units 
Festive Treats that we spoke of earlier was also run in partnership with CSCs  taking our festive offers to the remotest parts of the country  From a small businessman looking to avail a loan  to a family booking    looking to purchase a new television  the three month long Festive Treats campaign enabled it all 
Year to date  we have acquired 4 9 million new liability relationships  an increase of 50  over the acquisition in the corresponding period of the previous year  This was driven through various strategies that we adopted and have articulated in the past  As on December 31  2019  we had 13 9 million credit card base and 1 5 million merchant acceptance points 
Now in summary  we are proud of our start  while effectively executed our strategy resulting in  advances growth of 20   deposit growth of 25   card spending increased by 28   retail loan disbursals increased by 21   operating profit growth of 20   and profit after tax increased by 33  
With that  may I request the operator  Aman  to open up the line for questions

Yeah  hi  I just had a few questions  Firstly  in your slippage  what is the total amount of slippage  And how much of that is lumpy  And how much of that is agri 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Okay  the core slippage that we referred to 1 7   represents slippage of INR3 839 crores  3 8 3 9  The total  which includes that lumpy one offs  agri and all of them  let me see  that s between them  roughly  approximately INR1 500 crores 
Mahrukh Adajania    IDFC    Analyst
And how much is agri of that 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Roughly half    a little more than half  60  or so  agri  Yeah  60     maybe 60   65  agri 
Mahrukh Adajania    IDFC    Analyst
Okay  And just in terms of the additional provision that you ve need on a few corporate accounts  could you tell us the sectors 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
No  we said we don t want to talk about sectors  You can  I mean it will be    I don t want to get into individual names and individual types of what that is 
Mahrukh Adajania    IDFC    Analyst
Okay  And just in terms of HDB  the GNPAs have improved  So is that because of recoveries or better outlook in the geographies or any other reason 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
No  HDB  you would have seen    I read the number  stage 3 Ind AS    stage 3 method of Ind AS slippage that I see is 3 01   And the corresponding number for prior quarter is 2 72  
Mahrukh Adajania    IDFC    Analyst
Okay  sorry  I was comparing it to GNPA  So why has it gone up 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
This is more commercial transportation related  yes 
Rahul Shukla    Group Head Corporate Banking   Business Banking

Mahrukh Adajania    IDFC    Analyst
Sorry  So it s basically CVs 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Correct 
Mahrukh Adajania    IDFC    Analyst
Okay  And there has been no change in accounting  Like last time  there was some alignment to HDFC Bank s accounting  So all that is done with  This is just the cycle 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Correct  It was consistent with the last  or is it the    there s no change  Yeah

Next question is from the line of Manish Ostwal from Nirmal Bang  Please go ahead 
Manish Ostwal    Nirmal Bang    Analyst
Thank you for the opportunity  sir  My question  on our risk weighted asset to total asset ratio during the quarter  There s a sharp reduction of 400 odd basis points during the quarter  So can you explain the reason for the same  And secondly  on the slippage side  you gave the slippage number  Any recovery in the upgradation  Phonetic  in write off during the quarter  can you share that number    those numbers 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Okay  See  normally if you look at our capital ratios  We normally    our earnings offset the consumption  approximately  right  But this time around  we did have a benefit in RWA  the RWA to asset is currently at about 68  or so  I think prior quarter was more than 70   72   73   There has been an improvement  couple of things  We have some initiatives driving this efficiency as well as impact from mix of assets  Better market risk is one thing  Assessment of better market risk is one that improved  If you recollect  if you have any investments in mutual funds  they re considered equity mutual funds whereas these investments are actually debt mutual funds  So there is a different risk weight  And we don t have any at this stage on that  So there was some optimization done there  We reduced investments in that mix  right  So better mix there 
We also got some ratings improved  There were certain things that moved up on the ratings  that brought the risk weight down  And also  some favorable lending mix at    to low rated public sector like power or transport and things like that  that also contributed to better RWAs 
Manish Ostwal    Nirmal Bang    Analyst
So  recovery upgradation write off number  sir 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
I d    do you have the sheet here  No  We ll get Ajit to get you that number  I don t have that sheet in front of me 
Manish Ostwal    Nirmal Bang    Analyst
And the second question  on the retail book  so in this period  compared to quarter two to quarter three  are you seeing any incremental stress buildup in the any category of retail loans or mid corporate or SME portfolio  Qualitative comments will be very helpful 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Jimmy 
Jimmy Tata    Head  Credit and Market Risk
Hi  good evening  everyone  This is Jimmy  So in the retail book  I think the buildup there is very strong from product to product  We have over the last year put in filters across all products that may have showed somewhat of an uptrend  These filters now have had some vintage and maturity that allows us to measure the recent book  And in all these cases  the recent book is showing a considerably improved performance  and that would therefore be the trend in these books going forward  I ll come to specific names in a minute  When it comes to the residual historical book  we are relatively a well provided bank  so there is not a concern in terms of any adverse expectation on that front either 
So I think most retail products have actually shown a slightly beneficial trend over recent times  which is to say the  even automobiles  credit cards  personal loans  etc  The only growing concern would be in terms of commercial vehicles and  to some extent  commercial equipment  So it is the commercial products that are continuing to be some level of concern  And you might see the trend continue in that direction  This is not to say that we have not filtered those portfolios  It is not to say that there is no improvement on new acquisitions  but these do tend to have longer maturities  so the weightage in the portfolio as a whole would be a little less and therefore not visible immediately at a portfolio level  this would take some more time to resolve  And one has to also take into consideration that these products are a function of the economic climate and situation 
So we continue our policies across the board of no dilution in the face of facing difficulty in generating business  If certain products do not generate the required business  we would not generate that level of business  We manage our growth on geographic expansion  putting out a very wide product range across our extensive branch network  looking at the relatively unbanked and underbanked demographics in these areas as well as our existing areas  To some extent a new variant of a product being introduced into these segments  And of course  this gives you the ability in such demographics and segments to price appropriately for the incremental risk that could manifest 
So this is not to construe that we are expecting it to happen  But even should there be a 10 basis point  15 basis point increase in delinquency  the calculations for us internally based on probabilities  based on our expectations and our wide experience and analytics of all these products  we don t think it is advisable to forgo such growth given the probability of this small incremental delinquency  So that s effectively the trend across all retail products  As I said  just to answer your question in one line  CV  commercial vehicles  and to some extent  commercial equipment might be the only concern areas 
Manish Ostwal    Nirmal Bang    Analyst
Thank you for the qualitative assessment  And the only  one small data point  YTD basis  what is the increase in the NBFC portfolio for HDFC Bank  That s it  Thank you

The next question is from the line of Suresh Ganapathy from Macquarie Capital  Please go ahead 
Suresh Ganapathy    Macquarie Capital    Analyst
Yeah  I have three qualitative questions for Sashi  First  Sashi  can you just take us through the CSC business  how exactly it is shaping up  and what are the trends  If you can quantify  it would be great  Second is what is the status on the CEO selection  where we are and what have been done so far  That s the second one  And the third is  there has been a repeated breakdown of online banking for the banks time and again  So what are the steps which are being undertaken by the bank to ensure that this system downtime is corrected 
Sashidhar Jagdishan    Executive Director
Okay  Thanks  Suresh  On the first one  in terms of the CSC  We have about 1 3 lakh CSC accounts that we ve opened  About roughly 80 000 plus have been initiated as business facilitators  What that would mean is that the systems have been integrated  They have been sort of handheld and trained so that they can distribute our products digitally  Out of that 80 000 plus  I think roughly about 40  odd are    have become active in various stages of activation  which means that they now can start sourcing products  I guess  as Srini was mentioning  on a combined basis  I think we have touched about that 40  of that 80 000 have contributed to roughly 70 000 plus products in a month  which translates to two products per active CSC  So that s not a bad job for a start  And we believe that this is    this will increase with better engagement by the hub branches going forward  So it s a lot of hard work  And this is something that we will continue to do CSC by CSC  which is mapped to the adjoining branches 
In addition to that  I think one of the things that Srini did mention is that  the better CSCs  we would also like to make them as business correspondents  because you could do a lot more transactions at these centers  We have thus far  appointed about 3 400 odd BCs  As we have mentioned in prior calls  I think over a period of next six to 12 months  we would like to add or at least take the BC total to about 25 000  So that would sort of really give us a better penetration into these    into the semi urban and rural areas  as we had envisaged  So that s part one 
I think the  one of the things that we    the learnings from this particular experiment or the kind of initiatives that we    is that  when you engage with these CSCs on a constant and ongoing basis  which is the key  I think you would see a fair amount of activation and product distribution that is happening  So it s on track  It s as in line with the expectations that we had for this particular initiative 
The second one  to your second question  on CEO search process  I think  in the Board meeting  I think we have sort of agreed upon the search firm who is going to help in the search process  We    I think we do have kind of a road map or a glide path as to when the long list of candidates  the short list of candidates  whether both globally  both external and internal  will happen  when the interviews will be slated  I think that kind of a fine  the granular details have all been sort of agreed upon at the Board meeting today  I think  as probably we may have mentioned in the past  normally we would expect the bunging in the applications for the    to the regulator for approval somewhere around July  August  I think that s the time that we should see    we would have finalized  we would have had picked and shortlisted number one  number two  number three for RBI to approve  I think we are on track  I think the specifications that the Board has    and told  of course  we have to recuse ourselves  So there have been a fair amount of deliberations today on that particular account 
Suresh Ganapathy    Macquarie Capital    Analyst
Can you disclose the search firm  Sashi 
Sashidhar Jagdishan    Executive Director
Not exact  I think let it be officially come out  probably in the next couple of days  but I think it s be    there are some small  minor cost negotiations or commercial negotiations that needs to be inked out the in next couple of days  So once that is done  I m sure we will let you know that 
The second    the third part is on the technology issues  I think one of the things that we realized as a company is that we    this is    we have been victims of our own success  What we did not realize is with the kind of increase in businesses across liability  across assets  across payment products  and within payment products  multiple channels that we have been patronizing  whether it is the cards  whether it s the UPI volumes  I think we underestimated the growth in these volumes  I mean what one would have normally envisaged is that from a base level you normally size up for about four to five times the capacity  We realized the volumes have gone even beyond five times    the five times capacity that we had originally sized up  So it s more a kind of capacity issue 
But having said that  we are    we have post the December 2nd incident  I think we have been able to sort of segregate the parts  We have been trying  We have derisked the parts so that we can sort of have a lot more redundancies  We ve been adding capacities  We will  we hope to add more capacities  We will be rationalizing volumes  We realize that sometimes it doesn t make sense to acquire some of the marginal volumes  So we should be in a much better state  We are in a good state at this juncture  We are far more comfortable  We ve diverted a lot of traffic into multiple other channels  And we hope to sort of be even more comfortable over the next three to five months with lots more capacity is being added 
So thus far  I think things are very stable  We hope to sort of    I wouldn t like to say it too loud  We would like to keep our fingers crossed and we would like    we are monitoring this practically every minute now  so that the monitoring mechanism has only heightened thus far  So this is where we stand  It s    lot of questions are being asked whether there was a cyber attack  etc  I can categorically say  and we have said it to the regulator as well  that there was no such cyber attack or incident on the 2nd of December

Next question is from the line of Kunal Shah from Edelweiss  Please go ahead 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Yeah  hi  So firstly  in terms of this entire INR200 crores of recoveries pertaining to the resolution of the NCLT matter  So that s the P L impact  but if I have to look at it in terms of the flow of NPLs in terms of the recoveries  how would that number be  So in terms of the principal component  And anything in the interest income effect as well 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
There was no book value  when we had  It is a full recovery that came into P L 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Okay  So no impact at all in terms of the flow of NPLs and all 
Sashidhar Jagdishan    Executive Director
Yes  no 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Yeah  Then second  in terms of the branch expansions  so  I think  earlier during the Analyst Day  also we highlighted that the plan is now to move toward 600 to 700 branches a year  So  are we looking at it maybe when we look at it  240 odd  Phonetic  over last the last three odd quarters  So are we very much on track in terms of going in for the branch expansion  And should we see it coming over the next one or two quarters  which will have some impact on the OpEx as well 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Yes  our strategy to expand branches will continue  So we are on track for those  The branches that we are planning are of different sizes depending on location  So the cost per branch is not identical to what we have on books  or one branch versus another  There will be a good level of differentiation  It will also have a good mix of semi urban and rural and metro  As we said  we    this financial year  we targeted 600 new branches  say plus minus a few on timing depending on local approvals  equipment  Phoentic  and staffing  But we do expect  as usual  seasonally  quite a number of branch openings in this quarter  in our fourth quarter  And we anticipate that it will continue and we should be there 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Okay  And in terms of the behavior of the commercial vehicle and unsecured portfolio  are we seeing maybe in the early    early day buckets as well some kind of a rise of debt in both these portfolio 
Jimmy Tata    Head  Credit and Market Risk
Taking them both separately  The unsecured exposures are holding up rather well  Unsecured exposures  if you look at their essential nature  will primarily involve personal loans which are almost entirely toward salaried segments  Our segments are also not merely just the salaried segments but public sector  government and the higher rated entities among the private sector  and that s where it is predominantly situated  The volatility of income in these segments continues to be extremely low  and therefore the serviceability of the loans is holding up very well  And in terms of credit cards  there has actually been an improvement seen over a period of time in the various delinquency parameters  and this may be due to the customer selection  once again  a fair amount of cross sell to our own internal customers where we have the new accounts  see the fund flows  see the behavior  etc  But that is  once again  holding up rather well 
Commercial vehicles  I did cover briefly some while ago in    as part of another question  but commercial vehicles  due to the various economic factors as well as some of the auto sector factor  is something that needs to be looked at  monitored very carefully  Naturally  that is what we do  Have filters been applied into our policy  Do we have absolute micro management of the same  The answer is yes  Have we seen the recent book once again behaving better as a result of this  as per the historic book  Once again the answer there is yes  but given that these loans are of a longer maturity compared to personal loans and other such transactions on an average  there will be a larger component of the historic base in the portfolio as it stays  And we might need a little more time to see a complete change or reversal  And not to say that the environment  once again  is difficult for these operators  Trade rates have come down  Trade movement has come down  The efficiencies in the systems created by octroi abolition and GST and the other matters have really increased the productivity of vehicles  once again resulting in lower deployment  So these factors continue to affect  and we naturally watch these closely  And I hope that answers what you wanted to ask 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Sure  And lastly  just a clarification  Was there any contingency provisioning made when we are saying this INR1 457 crores of contingency provisioning at end of this quarter  So there was some INR660 crores which was made last quarter and INR150 crores in the    in Q1  but besides that  was other anything created this quarter 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Some minor amount  less than INR100 crores  I would say 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Okay  And this INR700 crores is entirely specific 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Yes  that is correct 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Okay  thank you 
Operator
Thank you  The next question is from the line of Deepak Agrawal from Axis Mutual Fund  Please go ahead 
Deepak Agrawal    Axis Mutual Funds    Analyst
Yeah  hello  sir  Sir  wanted to understand from a growth perspective for the bank  How much of that will be new loans versus acquisition from other banks and NBFCs for us  sir 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Other banks and NBFCs  no 
Sashidhar Jagdishan    Executive Director
It will be very difficult to sort of really  we don t sort of track that at an overall level  But having said that  a large part of our SME business could be takeover of loans from other banks  In terms of corporate side  which I think you did hear Rahul say that  we have not only looked at new customers who could be banking somewhere  we ve also sort of deepened our penetration into our existing customers  so there is a fair amount of deepening of relationship which has given us a bit of a help  Phonetic  to our credit growth 
On the retail side  it will be very difficult to conjecture as to where they re coming in from  but largely as a philosophy  Jimmy is here  I think he is far more comfortable to sort of provide credit to people who are not necessarily new to the system  but new to bank credit 
Jimmy Tata    Head  Credit and Market Risk
Yes  I would understand your question two ways  If you re referring to assets actually acquired from banks  that s not a very significant number at all  If you re talking to facilities that are taken over from other banks  depending on which segment  and I think  as Sashi articulated  it s correct  as you look more toward the SME and MSME segments  they do look at our new products  Rahul alluded to them  So when we do offer our stores integration and create facilities across  Indecipherable  corrections  etc   customers do seem to appreciate this  And that does encourage movement  Our cash management facilities  trade finance  all these are definitely attractive to such customers  Our 5 300 branch network definitely also follows up these customers on a regular basis  so there will be movement from one bank to another in such facilities  It varies from segment to segment 
Deepak Agrawal    Axis Mutual Funds    Analyst
Okay  OK  And sir  my second question is related to the Festive Treats  any numbers we can share in terms of  say  what will be the kind of income  And what would be the expense related to this campaign  sir 
Sashidhar Jagdishan    Executive Director
Sorry  Did you mention Festive Treats 
Deepak Agrawal    Axis Mutual Funds    Analyst
Yes  yes  sir  related to the Festive Treats 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Festive Treats is not one type of an activity that runs for one product  It is a bankwide program that runs across all product segments  geography segments  customer segments  It is kind of    we can think about it like both digital as well as a typical offering where  closed user group where we bring the dealers  manufacturers and the like  retailers and the like  to our customer base for a better shopping experience  for a better asset purchase experience  And we are intermediaries  where we finance where we should  So this is not something that s targeted to x volume of assets or x number of customers and where we have  It s all pervasive across everything  This is  as we said  we run through the quarter  And it s called Festive Treats  but in this quarter  it will be called something else  and it s an ongoing effort and it was an event where we brought in several partnerships together  and we continue with the partnerships as we go 
Deepak Agrawal    Axis Mutual Funds    Analyst
Okay  OK 
Sashidhar Jagdishan    Executive Director
So I think Srini did mention the business growth rates arising out of    during the period of October  November and December  I think we ve had a substantial lift in both asset disbursals and also in terms of payment costs spend  We wouldn t like to sort of put the income arising out of the same  neither do we want to even disclose the kind of expenditure  Of course  there was a bit of a lift in expenditure because of Festive Treats  which is completely baked into the 17 5  growth in this quarter s expenses  but it would not be appropriate for us to peel the numbers of the Festive Treats program 
Deepak Agrawal    Axis Mutual Funds    Analyst
Okay  got it  Yeah  Thank you

The next question is from the line of Rahul Jain from Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead 
Rahul Jain    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Yeah  hi  everyone  The first question  I actually  I ve got two  three questions  The first question is around slippages  So you ve talked about the core and agri stroke  Phonetic  any specific corporate account  Is it possible to get a similar number for last quarter as well as last year  either the core slippages or the bifurcation that you provided this quarter 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
The core slippage last quarter was same level  right  3 4    3 7 1 4  at 1 7   that was last quarter  Last year  the core slippage was INR3 300 crores  Phonetic   3 2 9 0 is what I have  again at 1 7  
Rahul Jain    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Okay  So last year  the gross was about INR4 000 crores  of which the core was 3 2 9 0 
Sashidhar Jagdishan    Executive Director
Yes  that s right 
Rahul Jain    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Okay  got it  got it  Thanks  The second question is  so in the latest FSR report  the RBI talked about increasing SMA 2 loans for the whole banking industry  which saw a jump from 4  to 7 5  in the month of September   Indecipherable  Sorry  about that  Have you seen a similar trend in the SMA 2 portfolio as well in your books  Or it is much lower than what the RBI reported in terms of the delta 
Sashidhar Jagdishan    Executive Director
No  It s been pretty much stable for quite some time now  We ve not seen    and in fact  even on an absolute level  it s pretty low compared to what we see in other banks  And even from a growth perspective also  we ve not seen too much of a growth in the SMA 2 numbers 
Rahul Jain    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Got it  got it  Just one last question  Sashi  So the fee income growth  which has again come out quite impressive  The retail loan growth  though  was tepid  So what explains this fee income growth  Was there any specific items there that may not continue  Or this is a result of a sustained pickup in the corporate book as well which is where we are benefiting by deepening relationships  etc  
Sashidhar Jagdishan    Executive Director
No  I think we have been mentioning this  Sometimes  we    it s sort of we  ourselves  are surprised with the kind of certain runs that we ve had in both in the third party distribution and also in the payment products  We have seen a decent amount of sustained growth rates in the spends  the corporate cards and the debit card spend that s upwards of about 20   25   which is sort of leading to this kind of a growth  You re right  I mean we  ourselves  sometimes are wondering when that will sort of really  Indecipherable  down  etc  But that is one of the reasons why we have seen a reasonably strong growth 
The other one is on the third party distribution  where while the volumes have been in the mid teens  but the yields on the products that we have been distributing     these have been reasonably better for the kind of new products that they have been launching  So that has also sort of helped us in this quarter  So  but if you really look at it  as we have been mentioning that in the past as well  we were  we normally expect about 13  to 15  of core growth in fees  Maybe  we have internally revised ourselves to somewhere between the 15  to 17  as the core growth that we can sustain over a medium to long term  So this is a bonus that we have got  and let s enjoy when it comes 
Rahul Jain    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Yeah  is it possible to get the composition of credit cards in our total fees 
Srinivasan Vaidyanathan    Chief Financial Officer
Credit card  which is the payment   
Rahul Jain    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Or maybe  payment  Indecipherable  etc 
Sashidhar Jagdishan    Executive Director
We have a conglomerate  I mean a holistic thing including all products  I think somewhere around the 30  to 35  would be the payment products  The retail  the core retail assets and liabilities will be another 35 odd percent  The third party distribution will be somewhere between the 15  and 20   and wholesale will be the balance  15  to 20  
Rahul Jain    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Got it  perfect  Maybe  Sashi  just one last question  if I can squeeze in  In the  on the Common Service Centre  you ve talked about 70 000 products have been originated  Is it possible to also know the average ticket size there 
Sashidhar Jagdishan    Executive Director
So this is a combination of both assets and liabilities  When you say they are not third party distribution products  they are accounts that they have brought in and in new customers  and the balances are as per our programs  We need to wait and watch how these balances or these customers behave over a period of time  but roughly I m saying about 60  to 70  would be liabilities  About 30   as we speak  would be the asset distribution  Maybe these things will change  With stabilization  maybe we ll have a 50 50 going forward 
Rahul Jain    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Got it  Perfect  Thank you so much  Thank you so much  Great

Thank you  The next question is from the line of Sri Karthik from Investec  Please go ahead  Sorry  it seems that we have lost the line for the current participant  We ll move to the next question  That is from the line of Aman Ahluwalia from Laburnum Capital  Please go ahead 
Aman Ahluwalia    Laburnum Capital    Analyst
Thank you very much  Two questions  First  on the corporate lending side  it appears  at least from the market  that it s really you and SBI who are aggressively out there trying to grow in on the corporate side  Most of the other large banks are not doing this even if they have a sort of deep history  vintage  etc  in terms of corporate lending  So if you could give us some color on what it is that you re seeing and able to do that your large private sector competitors are not able to do  that would be helpful  because I assume that a lot of them have a similar kind of diverse products that they can offer a range of services  a good technology  etc 
And secondly and relatedly  post the Altico issue  there was some harsh language used by SBI for HDFC  And at least anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that SBI has been very aggressive  even with clients  trying to keep HDFC out of clients where they are present  Any thoughts on  is this sort of minor issue that you think would blow over  Long term  could we see two of the country s largest banks just being involved in that sort of corporate war  I would just be interested to get your real thoughts on that 
Rahul Shukla    Group Head Corporate Banking   Business Banking
H  this is Rahul Shukla  So you re correct  SBI is a competitor which is very active  and we respect them a lot for their judgment and the marketplace presence  And we continuously go out and learn from them  In my travels throughout the country  I always make it a point to go out and also call on the seniors at SBI  because I think they are a very large bank  compared to us  with a rich history  And we continue to believe that we have lots to learn from them 
Secondly  on the corporate book growth  I will not be able to comment as to what the other banks don t speak  What we see is there is still ability to go out and grow  The only thing that we always constantly balance is that growth should not come at the cost of credit  quality  and growth should not come by dilution of my margins on the transaction  So those are two tenets  So I have to balance growth with margins  and with credit quality  which is what we have done  which is what we have tabled for all of you as well as the shareholders  as a result  in this quarter 
Aman Ahluwalia    Laburnum Capital    Analyst
Thank you  And just to understand that better  Is it fair to say that most of the business you re gaining on the corporate side is from PSUs who are less likely to have  say  non SBI PSUs or less likely to have the full suite of products  as opposed to places where   
Rahul Shukla    Group Head Corporate Banking   Business Banking
Yeah  actually  that is not a correct characterization  because for the bank  we believe that we might be the second largest corporate lender in the marketplace  When you grow  you have to have a broad based growth  Otherwise  you are going to creep up on your concentration of your lending portfolio  So as we see that  I mean we comment that in this particular quarter  yes  we did go out and see a little bit more on the public sector  because that is a segment of the marketplace which continues to create capital expenditure at this particular point of time  So we have benefited by being proactive with our solutions in front of clients

155707,377223,HDB,UPDATE 1 India WPI falls for first time in three decades,news,"  India s wholesale price index falls yr yr in early June
   Trend seen continuing for at least 3 months
   No more rate cuts seen as fall due to statistical reason
  Adds details  analysts comments and market reaction 
 By Rajkumar Ray
 NEW DELHI  June 18  Reuters    India s wholesale price
index fell in early June on an annual basis for the first time
in at least three decades  but analysts said this did not
signal a weakening economy and would not prod the central bank
to cut rates further 
 The central bank and analysts had forecast negative trends
in the price index mainly for statistical reasons  rather than
calling it deflation that follows a sharp contraction in
demand 
 The widely watched wholesale price index fell 1 61 percent
in the 12 months to June 6  the government said  sharply below
previous week s rise of 0 13 percent  The drop was bigger than
1 52 percent median forecast by analysts 
  This is due to the high statistical base  but going
forward inflationary risks are already in sight   said Rupa
Rege Nitsure  chief economist at Bank of Baroda 
 The price index has been rising on a week on week basis
since March reflecting a pickup in demand and ensuing price
pressures in Asia s third largest economy 
  The inflation momentum has been picking up and a continued
rise in commodity prices will exert upward pressure on input
costs   said Sonal Varma  an economist with Nomura 
 India s factory output unexpectedly rose in April  reviving
hopes the economy turned a corner and sparked speculation the
central bank may not cut rates again in near future 
 The Indian economy expanded 6 7 percent in the 2008 09 year
ended in March  slower than a scorching 9 percent in the
previous year but faster than many other emerging economies 
but policy makers say it could rebound to at least 7 percent
this year 
 Analysts said the annual fall in WPI had little implication
for monetary policy  and firm consumer price inflation  which
stood at 8 7 percent in April  has kept policy makers cautious 
   I think monetary policy will gradually start building
into the inflationary expectation some time around October
essentially because of rising commodity prices   said Jyotinder
Kaur  economist at HDFC Bank 
 India s central bank has cut its lending rate by 4 25
percentage points between October and April  while government
has slashed duties and increased public spending to stimulate
the economy hit by the global slump and falling domestic
demand 
 Last week  the finance minister urged banks to lower their
interest rates  taking cues from the central bank  and step up
loans to industry to help bolster sagging growth 
 The coalition led by the Congress party that was re elected
for a second five year term is due to present its budget on
July 6  which is expected to offer more economic stimulus 
 The 5 year bond yield was steady at 6 63 percent after the
release of price index data  higher than Wednesday s close of
6 61 percent  The 30 share BSE index extended losses to 0 5
percent at 0700 GMT after being down 0 1 percent after the
data 
  Inflation pressures are expected to gradually build up
towards third and fourth quarter of the current fiscal year  
said Shubhada Rao  chief economist at Yes Bank   By year end 
we expect  wholesale  inflation to exceed 5 5 percent

 By Rajkumar Ray
 NEW DELHI  June 25  Reuters    India s wholesale prices
fell less than expected in mid June from a year earlier 
marking a build up in price pressures as the economy picks up
and the effect of past sharp falls in energy prices wears off 
 The wholesale price index fell 1 14 percent in the 12
months to June 13  compared with analysts  median forecast of a
1 69 percent drop and the previous week s 1 61 percent decline 
government data showed on Thursday 
 Wholesale prices are expected to keep falling in annual
terms in weeks ahead and economists expect the central bank to
keep its interest rates low in the near term 
 But the data reinforced expectations that the closely
watched wholesale price gauge will start climbing again from
September onwards and some analysts say the rise will be
steeper than earlier thought  possibly prompting a rate rise by
year end 
  What this means is that the patch of negative annual WPI
 wholesale price index  will be be shortened   said D K  Joshi 
principal economist of rating agency Crisil 
  Interest rates stance will remain soft  There could be a
mild reduction   he said on short term outlook 
 Markets track the wholesale price index more closely than
consumer prices because it covers a wider range of products and
is published weekly while consumer price reports are published
monthly 
 The 5 year bond yield rose 2 basis points to 6 58 percent
after the data  while the benchmark stock index rose  before
slipping back into the red in afternoon trade 
 PRICE PRESSURES
 The annual declines in prices result from the comparison
with last year s elevated price levels reflecting soaring oil
prices  which peaked in mid 2008  But wholesale prices have
been rising on a week on week basis since March  reflecting a
revival in demand in in Asia s third largest economy 
 Annual consumer price inflation climbed to 8 7 percent in
April from 8 percent in March though it was still below
February s 9 6 percent level 
 Analysts said that with the statistical base effect set to
fade away and concerns about food supply because of lower than
normal rainfall this year  wholesale price inflation may spike
above the central bank s estimate for the end of the fiscal
year to March 2010 
 Following the data analysts pegged the rate at 5 5 8
percent compared with the central bank s earlier 4 percent
forecast 
 While D K  Joshi sees a chance of another small cut in the
central bank s lending rate from 4 25 percent  others are
bracing for tightening in response to an anticipated inflation
flare up 
  What will determine the course of monetary policy will be
how commodity prices behave and the inflation risks that are
building up in the economy   said Abheek Barua  chief
economist  HDFC Bank 
  There is every possibility of liquidity being drained from
the system through a CRR  cash reserve ratio  increase by
October itself  And perhaps we could start seeing rates move up
by the end of the year  
 India s factory output unexpectedly rose in April  reviving
hopes the economy turned a corner and sparked speculation the
central bank may not cut rates again any time soon

 NEW DELHI  Aug 6  Reuters    India s wholesale price index
fell in the year to July 25 for the eighth week in a row  but
the central bank is seen keeping to an easy monetary stance as
rising food prices provide a reminder of a revival in
inflation 
 Most analysts see the decline in the WPI as a temporary
aberration resulting from the annual comparison to high
year earlier prices  In addition  the central bank has said
price pressures are building  suggesting it sees no scope to
cut interest rates again 
 The widely watched wholesale price index  INWPI ECI  fell
1 58 percent in the 12 months to July 25  its eighth successive
drop  It compared with a 1 54 percent decline in the prior week
and a market forecast of a 1 5 percent fall 
 The WPI fell 1 61 percent in the year to June 6  the first
and steepest fall on record 
 In stark contrast  a food sub index jumped 9 7 percent from
a year earlier  On an unadjusted basis  it rose 0 8 percent in
the latest week alone   ID nBMA005531 
  The fact that food and commodity prices remain firm on a
de facto basis means inflation as a whole is a risk and will
only become severe as months go by   Jyotinder Kaur  economist
at HDFC Bank  said 
 The 10 year benchmark bond yield  was little
changed after the data  while the stock market  turned
positive and was up 0 3 percent 
 Even though the WPI shows falling prices  the central bank
is focused on the longer term inflation potential 
 At a policy review last week  it revised up its inflation
forecast for the year to the end of March 2010 to 5 percent
from 4 percent 
 It left its key policy rates unchanged  saying it wanted to
nurture growth  but the change in the inflation forecast was
taken by analysts as a sign of tightening measures to come 
 ID nBOM398293 
 Analysts polled by Reuters after the policy decision
expected the central bank to hold rates steady until December 
and saw the possibility of an increase in early 2010 
 ID nBMA003468 
 The central bank cut its lending rate by 4 25 percentage
points between October and April to 4 75 percent and the
government slashed duties and increased public spending to
stimulate the economy hit by the global slump and falling
domestic demand 
 The economy expanded by 6 7 percent in 2008 09
 April March   sharply slower than 9 percent in the previous
year  The central bank forecast 6 percent growth in 2009 10
with an upward bias 
 The WPI has been rising on a weekly basis since March as
price pressures slowly build up 
 The consumer price index  which has a greater weighting on
food items  rose 9 29 percent in June from a year earlier  data
showed on July 31 
 Analysts say the government may step up measures to try to
tame the rise in food prices  as monetary policy is not
effective in stemming what is widely seen as resulting from
supply side pressures   ID nSP376499

 NEW DELHI  Aug 26  Reuters    India may have seen
accelerating growth in the June quarter thanks to stimulus
measures  but drought in nearly half of the country s districts
and the global slump could hinder faster recovery 
 The country s gross domestic product is estimated to have
expanded 6 percent in the quarter from a year earlier and
faster than 5 8 percent in March quarter  the median forecast
in a Reuters poll of 15 analysts showed 
  Essentially  it was due to the government stimulus and
higher spending before the  April May  elections   said D K 
Joshi  principal economist of rating agency Crisil 
 For a graphic on India s GDP
  
 India s domestic demand driven economy fared better during
the global downturn than most of its Asian peers  such as
Japan  Taiwan  Singapore and Hong Kong  which slipped into
recession last year as the financial crisis hurt more
export dependent economies 
 The central bank slashed its lending rate by 425 basis
points between October and April to help Asia s third largest
economy weather the shocks of the global slowdown 
 The government also cut duties and increased spending 
which has put the fiscal deficit on track for a 16 year high of
6 8 percent of GDP for the current year  to be financed by a
record 4 51 trillion rupees   92 4 billion  in borrowing 
 But poor rains since the monsoon season began at the start
of June cloud growth prospects in an economy where rural
consumption accounts for more than half of domestic demand 
 Private economists said a drought could potentially erode
economic growth this year by 1 or 2 percentage points  A weak
recovery in the United States and elsewhere could also slow
India s return to a high rate of growth 
 On Tuesday  Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said the
economy could grow around 6 percent in the year to March 2010 
lower than the 6 7 percent growth in 2008 09 and after
expanding 9 percent or more in the previous three fiscal years 
 The prime minister s economic adviser  C  Rangarajan  said
the economy could bounce back to 7 8 percent growth in 2010 11 
 In the June quarter  industrial production  which accounts
for a quarter of GDP  expanded by 3 7 percent but exports were
down 31 3 percent 
 Below are percentage growth forecasts for April June

 NEW DELHI  Aug 31  Reuters    India s economy grew 6 1
percent in the June quarter from a year earlier  roughly in
line with forecasts  as government stimulus measures helped
spur demand  but a poor monsoon threatens to crimp growth later
in the year even as it drives prices higher 
 Weakness in private consumption combined with looming
inflation complicates the Reserve Bank of India s exit from its
expansionary monetary policy  with some economists expecting
tightening measures to begin only in 2010 
  The RBI s dilemma  between hiking policy rates and hurting
growth or staying pat but risking higher inflation
expectations  only gets worse   said Nomura economist Sonal
Varma 
 Consumers  share of spending in the Indian economy shrank
to 55 6 percent in April June from 58 percent a year earlier 
while the government s share rose to 9 9 percent from 9 6
percent on the back of stimulus spending  Monday s data
 showed 
  Government spending has held up demand  This was a period
when elections were held  and this also would have supported
demand   said D K  Joshi  principal economist at ratings agency
Crisil  who expects the central bank to hold off on a rate hike
until 2010 
 Officials expressed optimism on Monday about the economic
outlook  despite persistent worries about a monsoon on track to
be the worst in four decades  Agriculture accounts for only
about 17 percent of India s economy  but rural consumption
makes up more than half of domestic demand 
  The worst may be over   said Montek Singh Ahluwalia  the
influential deputy chairman of the government s planning
commission  which charts India s five year growth plans 
 Finance Secretary Ashok Chawla predicted growth of above
6 5 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2010  as strength
in manufacturing and services offsets weakness in agriculture 
 The economy accelerated from its 5 8 percent rate in the
previous quarter on pick ups in the mining  manufacturing  and
electricity and services sectors from the previous quarter 
 MANUFACTURING  SERVICES
 Growth was just above analysts  median forecast of 6
percent annual expansion  offering little fresh insight to the
market on when the central bank was likely to start tightening
policy 
  I think by January they would want to send some kind of
monetary signal to thwart inflationary expectations   said
Abheek Barua  chief economist at HDFC Bank in New Delhi 
  By the April policy meeting  we will see the first rate
hike of 25 basis points preceded by a 50 basis point increase
in CRR  cash reserve ratio    he said 
 The services sector  which accounts for more than 57
percent of the economy s output  grew an annual 7 8 percent in
the June quarter  compared with 10 2 percent in the year ago
period  Manufacturing output expanded 3 4 percent in the June
quarter while farm output was up 2 4 percent 
 The stock market  extended losses to 1 5 percent in
afternoon trade from a 1 1 percent drop before the data 
 The 10 year bond yield  edged down from 9    
month highs of 7 45 percent  and the partially convertible
rupee  inched up towards 48 90 per dollar in afternoon
deals 
 MONSOON BLUES
 In the 2008 09 fiscal year  India s economy grew 6 7
percent  its weakest in six years and well below rates of 9
percent or more in the previous three years 
 Just as early signs of recovery were visible with rising
sales of cars and homes  the economy was jolted by the worst
rainfall since 1972  with drought like conditions engulfing 40
percent of the country s districts   ID nDEL511115 
 However  last week the Reserve Bank of India warned the
poor monsoon was more likely to drive inflation than to curb
growth  The index of food prices jumped 13 3 percent in the
year through Aug 15  even as the wholesale price index fell for
an 11th week 
 The central bank cut its key lending rate by 425 basis
points between October and April  while the government has
slashed duty rates and stepped up spending to pump prime the
economy and prevent massive job losses 
 Last month  the central bank estimated growth during
2009 10 at 6 percent with an upward bias  The finance minister
said last week growth could rebound to 8 percent next year

   When  Friday midday  0630 GMT 
   Forecast  Annual 6 8 pct rise
 By Rajkumar Ray
 NEW DELHI  Sept 10  Reuters    India s industrial output
probably rose in July on consumer demand and government
stimulus spending  but the pace slackened from June because of
a drop in refinery output and as rural demand was dampened
after the worst dry spell in nearly four decades 
 The median forecast in a Reuters poll of 12 analysts on
Thursday was for an annual rise of 6 8 percent in production 
lower than a provisional 7 8 percent rise in June 
 Trade Minister Anand Sharma said last month industrial
output may have grown an annual 7 percent in July  but some
analysts said the pace of expansion may have been slower as
infrastructure industries expanded by just 1 8 percent 
  There is some improvement in manufacturing especially
interest rate sensitive sectors like automobiles  The
government s stimulus spending has already come into play  
said D K  Joshi  principal economist with rating agency Crisil 
 Last year  factory output in Asia s third largest economy
was hit after the financial crisis dented demand  Output grew
just 2 6 percent in 2008 09 fiscal year ended March from 8 5
percent in 2007 08 
 A series of interest rate cuts since last October backed by
tax cuts and higher spending revived demand and helped the
industry expand 3 7 percent in the June quarter 
 POCKETS OF PROSPERITY
 In its July budget  the government announced a new dose of
stimulus by stepping up spending by more than a third in
2009 10 to a record 10 trillion rupees   205 billion  and
offered tax relief to industry and infrastructure to propel
growth 
 But the weakest monsoon rains in nearly four decades have
smothered crops  driven up food prices and choked demand from
the almost 60 percent of the population living outside cities 
India s population is 1 1 billion 
 A survey of 500 companies showed manufacturing activity
expanded at its slowest pace in five months in August as firms
struggled to raise prices despite higher costs 
 However  demand from urban consumers is on the rise with
car sales climbing by more than a fourth in August  rising for
the seventh month on cheaper borrowing costs and new models 
 But a global slump continues to dent exports  which fell
for the tenth month in July  hindering faster factory
expansion 
 While festival demand pushes up industrial growth between
September and December  analysts say crop losses and lower
spending by rural households could trim economic growth 
  It will depress the GDP growth in the December quarter and
to some extent the industrial output also   said Crisil s
Joshi 
 Economic growth slowed to six year low of 6 7 percent in
2008 09 from 9 percent or more in the previous three years 
 The Planning Commission recently forecast 6 3 percent
expansion for 2009 10  while the central bank estimates growth
at 6 percent with an upward bias

 By Surojit Gupta and John Mair
 MUMBAI  Oct 27  Reuters    India s central bank laid the
groundwork on Tuesday for a rise in interest rates by
tightening credit to the commercial property sector  lifting
its inflation forecast and warning of the threat of asset price
bubbles 
 As expected  the Reserve Bank of India  RBI  left key
interest rates on hold but surprised markets by removing
emergency liquidity support measures that were implemented to
protect Asia s third largest economy from the global downturn 
 Stocks  extended losses to 2 5 percent after the
quarterly policy review and property shares  fell 7 3
percent as the RBI raised bank provisioning requirements for
commercial real estate loans 
  This could be one way for them to signal rate hikes are
imminent  It is tightening of course   said Ramya
Suryanarayanan  economist at DBS in Singapore 
 Despite the tightening  government bond yields fell after
the central bank raised the amount of deposits banks are
required to keep in government securities  soothing worries
about the market s ability to digest this year s record
borrowing 
 The central bank  which has been under pressure from
government officials to maintain its loose monetary policy 
kept its growth forecast for the fiscal year ending in March
2010 at 6 percent with an upward bias 
 India s economic growth slowed to 6 7 percent in the year
through March after three years of growth at 9 percent or more 
 However  the central bank raised its fiscal year end
projection of wholesale price inflation to 6 5 percent from 5
percent  with an upward bias  reinforcing market expectations
that the central bank will start raising rates early next year 
Some economists see inflation hitting about 8 percent by March 
much above the central bank s comfort zone seen at about 5
percent 
  It may be appropriate to sequence the exit in a calibrated
way so that while the recovery process is not hampered 
inflation expectations remain anchored   the central bank said
in its quarterly review 
  The  exit  process can begin with closure of some special
liquidity support measures   said the bank 
 It also said there was a  critical need  for the government
to borrow less and help sustain moderate interest rate levels 
 So far  Australia is the only Group of 20 economy to raise
rates amid signs of an easing in the global crisis  but India
and South Korea are expected to follow its lead in months
ahead 
 All three share concern that keeping monetary reins loose
for too long could fuel speculative bubbles in financial and
property markets 
 Indian stocks have risen about 74 percent since the start
of the year and the central bank noted that property prices
have risen  significantly  in major cities 
  They are saying  even though signs of recovery are
incipient  the equity and commodity markets are running ahead
of fundamentals   said Murthy Nagarajan  head of fixed income
at Mirae Asset Management 
 TIGHTENING LIQUIDITY
 Effective immediately  the RBI ended a special repurchase
facility for banks and another for the funding needs of
non bank financial companies  mutual funds and housing finance
companies 
 It also ended a foreign exchange swap facility for banks 
and cut an export credit refinance facility to a pre crisis
level of 15 percent from 50 percent with immediate effect 
 The central bank also raised the statutory liquidity ratio
 SLR  of commercial banks to 25 percent from 24 percent
effective Nov  7  and said the collateralised borrowing and
lending obligation liabilities of banks would be subject to
cash reserve ratio requirements from Nov  21 
 Analysts said raising the liquidity ratio would make it
easier for the government to borrow and the bond market
welcomed the move with the benchmark 10 year government bond
 yield falling 21 basis points 
 The government plans to borrow a record 4 51 trillion
rupees   96 1 billion  this year to finance a fiscal deficit of
6 8 percent of GDP 
  Going forward  we will have a reasonably high fiscal
deficit  but the rise in SLR would help the government borrow
more without widening this deficit   said Abheek Barua  chief
economist at HDFC Bank

 The central bank has cut its short term lending rate
 by 4 25 percentage points between October and
April to 4 75 percent  The reverse repo rate  at which the
central bank absorbs surplus cash   has been cut by
2 75 percentage points to 3 25 percent 
 In the  review  the RBI said bank credit remained sluggish
and cut its forecast for adjusted non food credit growth in
2009 10 to 18 percent from 20 percent 
  Banks are urged once again to step up their efforts
towards credit expansion while preserving credit quality which
is critical for revival of growth   it said

155760,377276,HDB,FEATURE Easy credit comes back to haunt Indian consumers,news,"By Krittivas Mukherjee
 NEW DELHI  Nov 26  Reuters     Credit is a devil that
dances in empty pockets   was the advice P V  Rajiv s father
gave him when the young salesman swiped his new credit card for
the first time to buy an expensive watch he could hardly
afford 
 As someone whose generation was brought up on the virtue of
thrift  Rajiv s father did not understand the culture of
unfettered consumerism that has been one of the engines of
India s stunning economic growth 
 If Rajiv couldn t pay up front for a purchase  he used his
card  until he exhausted his credit limit about six months ago 
  The outstanding is so high now that I am hardly able to
pay the minimum due   said the 26 year old  once the
quintessential ambitious customer every bank targeted  hoping
the offer of a credit card or loan for that dream car would
prove irresistible 
 With India s growth  an average of 8 6 percent in the last
four years  matched only by an expansive embrace of
debt fuelled consumerism among its growing middle class  the
country was a magnet for retail lenders 
 But now as the global slowdown hobbles India s growth 
while interest rates are still high  banks  companies and
consumers are feeling the strain of rising debt 
 According to latest central bank data  consumer credit
growth in August slowed to 17 4 percent from 21 4 percent a
year ago 
 Housing loan growth slowed to 13 9 percent in August from
17 percent last year  while advances for consumer durables fell
by 7 9 percent from a year ago 
 Car sales  a major indicator of the economy s health  fell
an annual 6 6 percent in October  the third decline in four
months 
  There has been significant moderation in retail credit
disbursal   Abheek Barua  chief economist of HDFC Bank  India s
second largest private bank  said 
  Consumer credit has fallen in the past 6 7 months because
of very high rates and with banks becoming more careful about
any spike in non performing assests  
 PAYING FOR PAST EXCESS
 Just a year ago things were very different 
 According to Goldman Sachs  Indian consumers  growing
appetite for cars  computers or clothes during the past eight
years accounted for nearly as much growth in global demand as
the United States  and triggered huge demand for credit 
 Total loans  including mortgages and unsecured loans such
as credit cards  grew around 30 percent annually in the last
three years  an expansion the central bank called
 unprecedented  
 But now the strain of the global slowdown is reflected in
most banks raising their loan loss provision  while
overextended Indians find themselves in the whirl of revolving
credit 
 The largest among Indian private banks  ICICI  a major
player in consumer credit markets  raised its bad loans
provision to 1 91 percent of net advances from 1 43 percent a
year ago  Retail credit is the biggest contributor to its bad
loans 
 According to ratings agency Crisil  a unit of Standard  
Poor s  Indian banks  consumer loans are now likely to be major
risk areas as bad debts are expected to rise to four percent of
advances by 2009 
 Outstanding loans on credit cards stood at about  6 billion
at the end of August  up a staggering 86 percent from a year
ago 
 NO CHECKS  LITTLE SECURITY
 Until about two decades ago a father would raise a loan
from friends and family or take an advance from his retirement
benefits to marry off a daughter or buy a house 
 But as the economy opened up  credit providers distributed
loans indiscriminately with little care for the
credit worthiness of the debtors    it became common to be
accosted by credit card agents or offered a loan with virtually
no demand for a security 
  If you produce your plane boarding pass  you might be able
to obtain a credit card as you exit the airport terminal  
Manmohan Agrawal  executive director of Axis Bank  said in a
Wharton School business report last year 
 Defaults were bound to follow  Consumer credit repayments
three months or more overdue form about 7 9 percent of total
loans outstanding this year  and  Crisil says  could touch 15
percent 
 India has about 30 million credit cardholders  a number
that has tripled over the past five years as private and
foreign banks chose plastic to break into the Indian market 
 Indians put  14 billion on their cards in fiscal 2008  more
than three times the amount charged four years earlier 
 Last month  police broke open the door of a Mumbai
apartment and recovered the bodies of A K  Nair    both had
swallowed poison    and their two dead children 
 Police found 73 credit cards in the house 
 The Nairs were not alone in their debt misery  In New Delhi
alone  courts are dealing with about 400 000 cases of bounced
cheques  mostly dishonoured payments for credit card purchases
and loans  the Times of India said

155761,377277,HDB,POLL India s 2008 09 growth to slow to 6 year lows,news,"By Swati Bhat
 MUMBAI  Dec 11  Reuters    India s economy is expected to
grow at its slowest pace in six years in the fiscal year to
March 2009 after three years of growth at or above 9 percent as
the global financial crisis hits hard  a quarterly Reuters poll
shows 
 Growth is forecast to slow to 6 8 percent in 2008 09 and
6 2 percent in 2009 10  the poll showed  highlighting the
deterioration over recent months in an economy that is largely
driven by domestic activity 
 In September  a similar poll had forecast growth of 7 5
percent in 2008 09 and 7 4 percent in 2009 10  The last time
the economy grew less than 7 5 percent was in 2002 03  when it
expanded just 3 8 percent 
 The private sector forecasts are significantly higher than
those of the central bank  which cut its key interest rates on
Saturday as part of a well flagged stimulus package  It
projects growth in 2008 09 at 7 5 to 8 percent 
 The government also announced extra spending and other
measures to shore up activity and confidence in the economy at
the weekend  following signs of a sharper than expected
slowdown and the deadly attacks on Mumbai in late November 
  We doubt they will be sufficient to quickly reverse
slumping growth in investment and exports  and rising
second round effects caused by higher non performing assets 
tightening credit conditions  falling property prices and
rising job losses   said Sonal Varma  economist at Nomura 
 As growth slows  inflation is expected to drop sharply to
3 8 percent in 2009 10  from an average of 8 95 percent in
2008 09  the poll said 
 Inflation hit 12 91 percent in early August  its highest
since annual data in the current series became available in
1995  but has since dropped to seven month lows of 8 4 percent
as global commodity and energy prices have fallen 
 Oil is India s biggest import  and its fall of more than
 100 a barrel from July s record high above  147 a barrel is
expected to ease pressure on the country s trade deficit 
 The trade deficit is still expected to top  100 billion for
the first time this year  but is seen holding at around  110
billion in 2009 10  about a third lower than forecast in the
September poll 
 The rupee hit a record low of 50 65 per dollar on Dec  2
and is down more than 20 percent this year as India was rocked
by the financial crisis 
 But as the intensity of the crisis eases next year  capital
outflows should slow down  allowing the rupee to recover to 48
per dollar by the end of June and to 46 25 by the end of the
year  the poll found

Chicago  IL   April 12  2019  Stocks in this week s article include Walker   Dunlop  Inc    NYSE WD    Herc Holdings Inc    NYSE HRI    ICICI Bank Ltd    NYSE IBN    HDFC Bank Ltd    NYSE HDB   and resTORbio  Inc    NASDAQ TORC    Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their  first  profit and explains why they are ones to watch Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research Buy These 5 Stocks as New Analysts Initiate Coverage
Many investors have immense confidence in the research work of analysts as they fear that misinterpretations while exploring on their own might trigger inefficiencies  Here  analysts play a vital intermediary role with their extensive access to relevant data 
Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  usually portrays higher investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something special in a stock to attract analysts to cover it  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely holds some value 
Obviously  stocks are not randomly chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it  After all  who doesn t like to produce something that is already in demand  Hence  we often find that analysts  ratings on newly added stocks are more favorable than their ratings on continuously covered stocks 
Needless to say  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change 
Impact of Analyst Coverage on Stock Price
The price movement of a stock is generally a function of the recommendations on it from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly more positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation 
Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock 
So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks

Apparently  risky stocks offer attractive returns only in bull market conditions  However  risk averse investors generally avoid such stocks since they significantly underperform amid bearish sentiments 
In this write up  we have presented a strategy that clearly shows that low risk stocks also generate handsome returns if some specific parameters are considered 
Beta Understanding
Beta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset in comparison to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of a security s price movement relative to the market  In this article  we are considering the S P 500 as the market 
If a stock has beta of 1 then the price of the stock will move with the market  So  the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1  In the same way  the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1 
For example  if the market offers a return of 20   a stock with beta of 3 will return 60   which is overwhelming  Similarly  when the market slips 20  the stock will sink 60   which is devastating

155843,377359,HDB,RBS Braces For No Deal Brexit  Seeks German Banking License,opinion,"In a move to prepare itself against no deal Brexit  The Royal Bank of Scotland  LON RBS  PLC   NYSE RBS   applied for a German banking license to make sure that the company can freely trade across the region  The news was reported by The Financial Times 
Per the article  RBS plans to convert the current Frankfurt branch into a regional  payments hub  that will be able to process and settle euro denominated payments  and give loans to large German clients along with taking in deposits 
Moreover  the state owned bank has started to make preparations for the move  It plans to hire about 12 employees  which would include treasury and local regulation specialists 
Though the move applies to all subsidiaries  RBS expects it to have an impact on NatWest Markets N V only as it trades across the bloc  Notably  RBS already has a Dutch license  which it had acquired along with ABN Amro before the crisis  With this license  the company will be able to operate freely across the European Union   EU   
Early December 2018  the bank disclosed that it had put forth request to the regulators to allow it move about  6 billion of assets and  7 billion of liabilities to NatWest  This is expected to impact nearly 30  of customers in NatWest markets 
In case a deal is struck between Britain and EU  the transfer of assets would be a slower process and be  subject to further political developments   per the bank 
Overall  Frankfurt seems to have been a favorite for majority  About 30 of the 37 U K  based financial institutions that have applied for licenses to the European Central Bank have picked Frankfurt as their EU base 
Notably  RBS is on its road to recovery  In August 2018  the company declared its first dividend post 2008 crisis  which led to boost investors  confidence  However  heightened competition  volatility in the global economy and litigation costs are some major concerns surrounding the company s growth 
Shares of RBS have lost 23 1  over the past six months compared with 10 7  decline recorded by the  it belongs to

155849,377365,HDB,Buy These 5 Stocks As New Analysts Initiate Coverage,opinion,Many investors have immense confidence in the research work of analysts as they fear that misinterpretations while exploring on their own might trigger inefficiencies  Here  analysts play a vital intermediary role with their extensive access to relevant data Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  usually portrays higher investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something special in a stock to attract analysts to cover it  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely holds some value Obviously  stocks are not randomly chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it  After all  who doesn t like to produce something that is already in demand  Hence  we often find that analysts  ratings on newly added stocks are more favorable than their ratings on continuously covered stocks Needless to say  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change Impact of Analyst Coverage on Stock PriceThe price movement of a stock is generally a function of the recommendations on it from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly more positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof Here are the other screening parameters Price greater than or equal to  5  as a stock below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors  Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares  if volume isn t enough  it will not attract individual investors  Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen Walker   Dunlop  Inc    NYSE WD    a commercial real estate financial services provider  currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Although shares of Walker   Dunlop have underperformed its  over the past year  earnings estimates have risen 4 2  for the current year over
