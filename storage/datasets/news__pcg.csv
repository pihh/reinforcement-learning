216667,438183,PCG,Why Shares of PG E Soared Higher Today,news,"What happened
Shares of PG E  NYSE PCG  closed up more than 13  on Monday  after the bankrupt utility updated its reorganization plan to try to address the concerns raised by California Gov  Gavin Newsom  The governor s office is one of the last remaining major parties PG E has yet to win over  and the move is a major step forward in the company s attempt to emerge from bankruptcy with its equity retaining some of its value 
So what
PG E filed for bankruptcy protection in early 2019 to deal with an estimated  30 billion in liabilities stemming from the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California  In most cases equity holders are wiped out when a company declares bankruptcy  but PG E from the beginning built its reorganization plan based on having common shares retain some value upon emergence 

That plan came under a number of challenges throughout the year  and PG E shares lost more than half of their value in 2019  but the utility has slowly worked through issues raised by creditors and other constituents and has made steady progress toward emerging midyear 
But Newsom remains skeptical of the plan  voicing concerns related to governance and accountability  PG E needs the governor s support to gain access to a state run fund that s designed to manage liabilities for future fires and minimize the risk of falling into bankruptcy again in the future 
The shares were up Monday after PG E said it was overhauling its board and adding a chief risk officer and chief safety officer who would both report directly to the CEO  The utility will also appoint an independent safety advisor and form an independent safety oversight committee with non PG E employees to review operations 
PG E said it believed the changes would address Newsom s concerns 
Now what
Obviously  it is up to Newsom  and not PG E  to say whether these changes are enough to satisfy the governor s concerns  But Newsom has as much reason to get a deal done as PG E does  The governor needs to take a hard line to make sure the state s power grid is safe  but he also has to make sure PG E and the state s other utilities are able to function  to make sure California citizens are able to keep their lights on 
The market is guessing that PG E s olive branch will be enough to move us forward and get a deal done  I think that is the correct interpretation  and expect PG E to emerge from bankruptcy midyear  But given the volatility of the stock  and the risks associated with a bankruptcy  investors should wait until PG E has emerged before weighing buying shares of this utility ",2020-02-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqljm,2074932

If PG E does exit by June 30  any future wildfire costs should be partly covered by the  21B state wildfire fund created by California state law AB 1054  passed last year 
One reason for Mizuho s optimism is that the damages from last October s Kincade Fire are shaping up as a relatively mild  700M after insurance  a sum that likely would not derail the company s deals to settle the costs of 2017 18 wildfires 
For those fires  PG E agreed to pay  11B to cover insured damages   13 5B to cover uninsured damages  and  1B to compensate state and local governments for fire costs

Shares of PG E  NYSE PCG  traded up more than 10  on Thursday following the bankrupt utility s announcement that it has settled a dispute with a group of powerful creditors  The settlement clears a key hurdle in the company s effort to reorganize and should help ensure that equity holders get a payout as part of that reorganization 
So what
PG E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019 to deal with an estimated  30 billion in liabilities stemming from the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California and other wildfires  The company s initial plan was to reorganize in such a way that its common shares would retain some value upon emergence  but that plan has been challenged at numerous points throughout the last 12 months 

In October  the judge overseeing the case ruled that creditors could file a rival plan of reorganization  one that would not be so friendly to shareholders  But PG E in a statement late Wednesday said it had reached an agreement with all claim holders who filed letters in support of that rival plan  including heavyweights Elliott Management and Pacific Investment Management Co   and that the rival plan would be withdrawn 
As part of the agreement  PG E has agreed to handle the creditor claims via new notes to be issued by the utility  reinstatement of certain senior notes  and the payment of debt placement fees and reimbursement  PG E said the new notes will save ratepayers about  1 billion 
Now what
With creditors now out of the way  the last remaining major obstacle standing in the way of PG E is California Governor Gavin Newsom  In December  Newsom voiced concerns related to governance and accountability  and the two sides so far have not been able to come to an agreement 
There s reason to hope the two sides can compromise  PG E needs state support in order to gain access to state assistance to help deal with future wildfires  and the governor needs to make sure the utility s reorganization isn t thrown into disarray  causing the lights to go out on constituents  But PG E is still a risky stock to own  and best left to short term traders until the company is out of bankruptcy ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pm0we,2066402

216734,438250,PCG,PG E Plunges as It Races to Meet Governor Bankruptcy Demand,news," Bloomberg     Pacific Gas   Electric Co  NYSE PCG  shares plummeted after California Governor Gavin Newsom rejected its bankruptcy restructuring plan  forcing the company to make sweeping changes to meet his demands 
The state s largest power company has until Tuesday to address conditions that Newsom laid out in a letter late last week rejecting its reorganization proposal  The governor said the current plan falls  woefully short  of meeting requirements of a key state law and insisted on changes that could reshape PG E  including an entirely new board and the option for a takeover 
The company s shares fell as much as 23  in New York  Its most actively traded bonds rose as Newsom s move bolsters a rival reorganization plan proposed by a group of bondholders 
Newsom s rebuke upends PG E s restructuring just as the path toward a smooth exit next year seemed to be clearing  The San Francisco based company  in bankruptcy after its equipment caused massive wildfires  earlier this month reached a  13 5 billion settlement with victims of the blazes  The deal  however  is dependent on the governor s support and his determination that the reorganization complies with a state law that would provide financial assistance for future fire costs 
 His list of demands might be hard for the company to accept  putting the whole Chapter 11 timeline in jeopardy   said Jared Ellias  a bankruptcy law professor at the University of California  Hastings   He could have asked for something akin to changing the drapes  Instead it s more like he is asking them to change their floor plan  
In his letter to PG E Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson  Newsom said the bankruptcy resolution  must yield a radically restructured and transformed utility that is responsible and accountable   He called for a better financial plan  clearly defined safety metrics and a  streamlined process  for a state or third party takeover if warranted  He also said he doesn t expect that the post confirmation board will include any current directors 
PG E said its plan meets state law and  is the best course forward for all stakeholders  
 We ve welcomed feedback from all stakeholders throughout these proceedings and will continue to work diligently in the coming days to resolve any issues that may arise   the company said in a statement Friday 
Under the settlement agreement  the company has to modify the plan in a manner  acceptable to the governor  by Tuesday 
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
 California Governor Gavin Newsom s broad objections to PG E s exit plan may require substantial changes in financial and governance structures

Click here to view the research 
Newsom  who took office just weeks before PG E filed the largest ever utility bankruptcy in January  faces political pressure to show dramatic changes  The company s role in deadly wildfires has provoked widespread public outrage  which was exacerbated in October after a series of mass blackouts designed to keep its power lines from sparking blazes during dry  windy conditions  The governor threatened a state takeover of the company after the outages if it couldn t improve its operations 
 After the company exits bankruptcy  Newsom really needs it to succeed   Ellias said   It could put his entire career as governor in jeopardy if this company isn t successful  
A recent poll by the University of California at Berkeley showed that a majority of the state s voters are in favor of changing the way PG E operates  with one third wanting an end to it as an investor owned utility 
Already  a California lawmaker is planning to introduce legislation that would turn PG E into a government owned utility  And a group of mayors and local officials have floated a proposal to make it a customer owned cooperative 
Rival Bid
Newsom s demands could give a boost to Elliott Management Corp   Pacific Investment Management Co  and the other bond holders proposing the alternative restructuring strategy  It calls for injecting  20 billion in cash into PG E in exchange for most of the equity in the company 
PG E s 6 05  senior unsecured notes maturing in 2034 gained about 1 2 cents on the dollar to 107 7 cents at 9 24 a m  in New York  according to Trace bond price data 
In a statement Thursday  Elliott blasted PG E s own restructuring proposal  saying it would saddle the company with an additional  10 billion in debt  limit its safety investments and turn the utility into a  junk bond issuer  
In his letter  Newsom raised similar concerns that PG E s debt heavy plan wouldn t allow for the company to make billions of dollars of needed safety investments

216736,438252,PCG,PG E  Newsom Clash Over a Clause That May Allow State Takeover,news," Bloomberg     A clause that would allow California to take over bankrupt utility giant PG E Corp   NYSE PCG  under certain circumstances has emerged as a big sticking point in negotiations between the company and Governor Gavin Newsom 
Newsom wants the power company to include a provision in its reorganization proposal that would allow the state to take control of its assets if it fails to meet performance and safety metrics  Negotiating such a clause has become one of the biggest challenges in talks between the company and the governor s office  people familiar with the situation said  asking not to be identified because the information isn t public 
Newsom s support is crucial to PG E s efforts to exit the biggest utility bankruptcy in U S  history by a state imposed deadline of June 30  The power giant filed for Chapter 11 in January after its power lines were tied to deadly blazes that erupted across Northern California in 2017 and 2018  leading to an estimated  30 billion in liabilities 
Now that PG E has reached settlements with wildfire victims and their insurers    two groups at the center of its reorganization    Newsom s sign off becomes the biggest obstacle in the company s efforts to get a restructuring deal done 
 The governor has been clear about the state s requirements   a new and totally transformed entity that is accountable and prioritizes safety   Newsom s office said in a statement   Critically important to that is ensuring that the new entity has the flexibility to fund this transformation  These points are not negotiable  
PG E intends to comply with the state s requirements and will continue to address the demands raised by the governor in his letter  the San Francisco based company said 
 PG E has been engaged in constructive dialogue to address those concerns with the common objectives of having PG E be safe  sound and financially stable upon emergence from Chapter 11   the company said in its statement   PG E expects this dialogue to continue  
The company s shares rose 5  to  11 47 at 3 39 p m  in New York 
Governor s Approval
Any reorganization would have to be approved by a state utility commission that the governor appoints  And the company will have to prove to Newsom s office that it has fully resolved its bankruptcy and past wildfire liabilities by June if it wants to participate in a new fire insurance fund to avoid future catastrophic losses

Newsom has also ordered PG E to replace its entire board and come up with a better financing plan that s cost neutral for its customers and isn t so dependent on expensive short term bridge financing  The company and the governor s office are working on those demands  people familiar with the talks said 
Meanwhile  a rival restructuring plan being pitched by PG E bondholders including Pacific Investment Management Co  and Elliott Management Corp  already includes a clause that would allow for a state takeover  But the option would only kick in if the company is found guilty of willful misconduct related to a future fire    and only if the blaze burns than 5 000 buildings  according to documents obtained by Bloomberg

216737,438253,PCG,PG E creditors offer California wildfire victims  13 5 billion in cash upfront,news,"By Kanishka Singh
 Reuters    PG E Corp s  N PCG  creditors have sweetened their offer to California wildfire victims  saying they are now prepared to pay  13 5 billion in cash upfront  according to a letter sent on Friday to state governor Gavin Newsom 
Current terms of the settlement deal  approved by a U S  bankruptcy judge on Tuesday  call for half of the settlement to be financed with stock in a newly reorganized PG E 
In the letter  the bondholders led by Elliott Management said their latest proposals will make sure individual victims  are prioritized  as they should be  and will address demands Newsom had raised earlier 
Newsom said on Dec  13 that the settlement had lacked major changes in governance and tougher safety enforcement mechanisms mandated under the state wildfire statute  It would also leave the company with a weakened capital structure and  limited ability to withstand future financial and operational headwinds  
The new plan calls for no debt at the reorganized holding company and a new board with residents from California forming the majority of directors 
It also allows for a takeover of PG E by the state if the company is found to have caused any single future wildfire that destroys more than 5 000 structures 
PG E said after the disclosure of the letter that it is continuing to talk with the stakeholders  Newsom s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment after business hours on Friday 
PG E said earlier it had reached a deal with labor  safety and customer advocacy groups calling for regulators to allow PG E to implement some rate increases for funding wildfire prevention efforts and safety improvements

PCG vs  S P 500 data by YCharts 
So what
PG E filed for bankruptcy in January to deal with an estimated  30 billion in liabilities stemming from the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California  In many cases  that s the end of the story for equity holders  with shares often wiped out as part of the reorganization process  However  from the beginning  PG E built its reorganization plan around the common shares retaining some value upon emergence 

There have been a lot of ups and downs along the way  The judge overseeing the case in October ruled that creditors could file a rival plan of reorganization  one that would not be so friendly to shareholders  That caused PG E to scramble to win backing from some key creditor groups  including wildfire victims 
In December  California Governor Gavin Newsom voiced his own concerns related to governance and accountability  calling into question whether PG E would be able to eventually access a state managed fund being set up to help utilities handle future wildfire claims 
Now what
PG E remains in bankruptcy protection  The company appears on track to reorganize using its own shareholder friendly plan  but creditor groups remain opposed  and further twists are possible 
If things go according to plan  there s at least the possibility that the shares have some room to run prior to the company s emergence  But as we saw in 2019  things seldom go as planned during bankruptcy  And PG E management might decide in the months to come to give creditors a bigger piece of the equity pie or take other actions that would eat into the value of individual shares in order to ensure a smooth exit from bankruptcy 
Long term shareholders are not likely to be made whole regardless of what happens  with PG E shares down more than 80  over the past three years  We re finally moving toward the closing chapters of the PG E bankruptcy saga  but investors should probably avoid the stock until the reorganization is complete ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfk1u,2055302

216752,438268,PCG,PG E Could Have Prevented Deadly California Fire  State Says,news," Bloomberg     Bankrupt utility giant PG E Corp   NYSE PCG  for years failed to properly inspect and maintain its transmission system    an oversight that led a live wire to fall and ignite the deadliest blaze in California history last year  state investigators said 
A PG E crew hadn t climbed and inspected the tower and hook that failed  sparking the catastrophic Camp Fire  in 17 years  a California Public Utilities Commission investigation made public Monday shows  The company would ve discovered that the hook had worn down if it had checked the tower  and its  timely replacement could have prevented  the blaze from happening  the commission s safety division said in the nearly 700 page report 
 The identified shortcomings in PG E s inspection and maintenance of the incident tower were not isolated  but rather indicative of an overall pattern of inadequate inspection and maintenance of PG E s transmission facilities   the agency said in its findings 
The November 2018 Camp Fire killed 85 people  burned down tens of thousands of homes and all but destroyed the Northern California town of Paradise  It ultimately led to PG E s undoing  saddling the company with crippling liabilities  In January  the company declared the biggest utility bankruptcy in U S  history amid an estimated  30 billion in damages tied to that wildfire and a series of others that broke out across Northern California in 2017 
PG E shares fell as much as 3 7  Tuesday 
PG E said in an emailed statement that it  accepts  the conclusion in the report that its power line caused the Camp Fire   We remain deeply sorry about the role our equipment had in this tragedy  and we apologize to all those impacted   the company said 
California fire investigators had already identified PG E s equipment in a previous report as the ignition source of the Camp Fire  The utility commission s probe revealed more detail on the rules that PG E broke leading up to the blaze  identifying 12 violations  The findings may result in fines or penalties imposed by the five member panel 
The district attorney of Butte County  where the Camp Fire broke out  and California s attorney general were still deciding whether to file criminal charges related to the blaze 
Estimating Liabilities
The report is hitting just as PG E prepares for a federal court case that will determine exactly how much in wildfire liabilities it s responsible for  In the coming months  a judge will hold hearings to decide on the size of claims stemming from the Camp fire and 2017 blazes  The outcome could serve as the foundation of a restructuring plan that PG E hopes will have it emerging from bankruptcy by the middle of next year 
The commission s report described PG E s routine inspections as  inadequate   failing to detect defective hooks and other equipment prone to failure  One so called C hook close to the transmission failure showed a  material loss of over 50   in one section  according to the investigation 
Based on PG E s own maintenance manual  the report said   this is a hazardous Priority A condition which requires immediate response and continued action until the condition is repaired   Butte County prosecutors asked the state to collect the hook as evidence 
PG E said it has accelerated inspections since the 2017 and 2018 blazes and has  completed an unprecedented process to inspect every element of our electric system within the high threat fire areas   The company said it has checked almost 730 000 transmission  distribution and substation structures and more than 25 million electrical components in those areas

216764,438280,PCG,California utility PG E s stock tumbles as wildfire spreads,news,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Shares of bankrupt California power utility PG E Corp  N PCG  extended losses on Monday as investors worried that its equipment might be responsible for wildfires spreading in northern California 
After a brief trading halt caused by its rapid fall  PG E s stock was down 16   bringing its loss to nearly 50  since late Wednesday  when the Kincade Fire started in Sonoma County and rapidly became the worst blaze in California 
Crews on Sunday lost ground against the wind driven fire that has blackened part of the state s picturesque wine country and driven 190 000 people from their homes  The Kincade Fire is the worst of more than a dozen major blazes that have damaged or destroyed nearly 400 structures and prompted Governor Gavin Newsom to declare a statewide emergency 
While the cause of the Kincade Fire has not been determined  it appears to have erupted near the base of a damaged high voltage transmission tower owned by PG E  which is California s largest investor owned utility and serves the northern part of the state 
California s wildfires generally erupt in the fall as hot  dry winds blow westward  High wind forecasts prompted PG E to shut off power to about 940 000 customers in 43 counties on starting on Saturday to guard against the risk of touching off more wildfires  The utility said the protective blackouts could last two days 
PG E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January  citing potential liabilities in excess of  30 billion from major wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment  Its stock market value has shrunk to under  3 billion from  25 billion a year ago ",2019-10-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/california-utility-pges-stock-tumbles-as-wildfire-spreads-2006099,2006099

Thousands of residents have already fled and hundreds of thousands of others were left in the dark with power companies cut off electricity to try to prevent more fires being sparked by snapped cabling in the brushland 
 I know this moment generates a tremendous amount of anxiety   California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday about the two major blazes burning at opposite ends of the state 
The latest fire broke out near the Getty Center museum  housing priceless artworks  on the west side of Los Angeles  hundreds of miles from where crews were fighting the biggest and most destructive fire  the Kincade  north of San Francisco 
Los Angeles Lakers basketball great LeBron James   Terminator  actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger  as well other celebrities  said on Twitter they had been forced to leave their homes 
Weather forecasters are forecasting there could be worse to come 
 The worst of this  weather  is coming later today and tonight   Marc Chenard  a forecaster with the National Weather Service s Weather Prediction Center  said early on Tuesday 
 The winds in the south will really pick up  50 to 70 mph with some gusts up to 80 mph in the Los Angeles mountain area  
The so called Santa Ana winds in the south could hit their worst levels of the season and last into late Thursday  Chenard said  adding that northern California will not be spared either 
Until at least Wednesday  in the bone dry wine country about 70 miles north of San Francisco  winds will hit up to 65 mph in the mountain areas and 35 mph in the valleys and coast  he said 
POWER CUTS
Pacific Gas and Electric Company  PG E   N PCG  said early on Tuesday that almost 600 000 more electric customers would have their power shut off  starting early in the day  as a fire prevention measure ahead of the wind storms 
This is on top of the 970 000 customers already shut off  although about half of those were restored by Monday night  the company announced 
As of early Tuesday  the Kincade fire had scorched more than 74 000 acres  destroyed 123 homes and other structures and was 15 percent contained as it burned across parts of Sonoma County s picturesque wine country  state fire officials said 
The governor said he was confident that firefighters had secured enough perimeters around the Kincade fire that it no longer posed an imminent threat to two communities north of Santa Rosa  although he conceded the fight was not over 
The so called Getty fire covered more than 600 acres in the scrub covered hills around Interstate 405  near some of the city s most expensive homes 
It destroyed eight structures and was 5 percent contained  officials said 
The Getty fire prompted the University of California at Los Angeles  about 2 miles  3 km  from the Getty Center  to close for the day  along with a number of public schools 
Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas said his firefighters had told him  they were literally overwhelmed  in the early hours of the Getty fire   They had to make some tough decisions on which houses they were able to protect

216767,438283,PCG,California fire threatens PG E s plan to raise  14 billion,news,"By Jim Christie
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    A wildfire raging in California threatens to destroy more than homes and businesses   it could also undermine bankrupt PG E Corp s  N PCG  plan to raise  14 billion to finance the crisis stricken utility s turnaround plan 
If the fire becomes large enough  investors could walk away from their commitment to finance the California power utility s bankruptcy plan  That would put in doubt the company s plan to provide up to  8 4 billion to victims of past fires blamed on the company s equipment 
In Sonoma County north of San Francisco  the Kincade Fire has burned more than 75 000 acres in PG E s service area since breaking out on Oct  23  forcing evacuation orders for some 180 000 people 
The fire has destroyed 124 structures and more than 90 000 are threatened amid strong winds and dry weather  according to CalFire  California s fire fighting agency 
The number of structures destroyed is key to PG E s bankruptcy exit plan  Any fire this year caused by PG E that destroys more than 500 homes or commercial structures would trigger a clause in the financing agreement that would allow investors to back out  The agreement has a similar termination clause for next year 
PG E said in court filings last week it has agreements to sell  14 billion of stock to affiliates of investment firms such as Abrams Capital Management LP  Knighthead Capital Management LLC and Soros Fund Management 
The cause of the Kincade Fire has not been determined  But it ignited near a broken wire on a PG E transmission tower  raising concerns that the company s equipment may again be to blame for a massive wildfire 
The San Francisco based power producer in January filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection anticipating its liabilities from massive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 blamed on its equipment could top  30 billion 
One of the blazes  November s Camp Fire  leveled the town of Paradise and destroyed more than 14 000 structures in the deadliest and most destructive in California s modern history 
PG E s main priority in its bankruptcy is paying thousands of wildfire victims  which it expects to do with  34 billion in debt financing and its  14 billion in equity commitments 
Wildfire victims have rejected PG E s plan and back a competing proposal by a group of the company s bondholders 
Several investment firms that have committed to buy PG E stock declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment 
A principal at one firm  however  said the firms are standing by their commitments  noting they could simply choose to waive the termination clause even if the number of structures destroyed by the Kincade Fire tops 500 
Losses from the blaze so far appear small and a determination on its cause could be some time off  he added 
It took state investigators over a year to determine that PG E was not at fault for October 2017 s Tubbs Fire  which struck Santa Rosa  California  and was the state s most destructive wildfire until the Camp Fire 
PG E spokesman James Noonan said the company and state authorities are only beginning to investigate what triggered the Kincade Fire 
 It s too soon for us to be talking about an event for which there is no official cause   he added

The bankrupt Californian power producer said the latest cuts were intended to avoid its equipment sparking wildfires in hot weather 
 This afternoon  the company began its 48 hour advance notifications to customers that it may be proactively turning power off for safety and conducting a Public Safety Power Shutoff  PSPS  on late Wednesday evening   it said 
The power cutoffs may affect 15 California counties and are likely to be much smaller in scope than the Oct  9 12 PSPS event  the company said 
It activated its emergency operations on Sunday night because of a possible strong and dry offshore wind 
The primary phase of weather risk was expected to last about 18 to 24 hours from Wednesday evening through the middle of Thursday  PG E had said on Sunday 
The company s handling of recent power outages has been criticized for being too widespread  with insufficient communication with customers 
The outages are the latest in a string of events for which PG E has been widely criticized  The utility filed for bankruptcy in January  citing potential civil liabilities in excess of  30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment 
The notifications to customers about the upcoming power cutoffs left many of them frustrated  with some complaining on social media

216788,438304,PCG,California Governor Attacks PG E for Blackout Caused by  Greed and Neglect ,news," Bloomberg     Faced with mounting public anger over massive blackouts  California Governor Gavin Newsom blamed Pacific Gas   Electric Co  NYSE PCG  for years of  greed and neglect  and demanded major structural changes at the bankrupt utility 
Newsom s comments came as many Californians questioned whether PG E overreacted to a windstorm that didn t prove as powerful as forecast  The company cut electricity to more than 2 million people    the largest preemptive blackout in the state s history    to prevent its power lines from sparking wildfires 
The Democratic governor  who on Wednesday called the blackouts  appropriate under the circumstances   took a dramatically harsher tone Thursday  blaming PG E for not hardening its grid and saying the outage was the result of years of bad choices  His comments came just before PG E s chief executive officer made his first public appearance  apologizing to customers for the  hardship  the power failures have caused while defending the decision 
The company said it has restored service to more than half of the customers affected  according to a statement issued at about 11 p m  local time 
Shares of PG E plunged on Thursday after the utility was stripped of exclusive control over its bankruptcy process and a judge allowed competing plans from wildfire victims and bondholders to advance  The surprise led Citi analysts to cut the stock to sell and warn there s a 75  chance the shares could fall to zero 
Story of  Greed 
 It s decisions that were not made that have led to this moment in PG E s history    it is not conditions   Newsom said at a Thursday evening press conference in the state s emergency operations center   This is not  from my perspective  a climate change story so much as a story of greed and neglect  
Newsom said he wanted to see a  major reorganization of this entity  and said PG E was too large to move quickly  But the governor stopped short of saying what kind of structural changes he preferred  He suggested the company needed to be far more surgical about future outages  saying some counties didn t need to be included in this week s blackouts  He acknowledged  however that such preemptive power cuts should remain an option for the state s utilities when faced with dangerous winds 
PG E  he noted  made a decision last November not to cut power near the town of Paradise during a windstorm  A transmission line then sparked the Camp Fire  the state s deadliest blaze  which killed 86 people 
312 000 Without Power
After affecting almost 750 000 accounts    or about 2 25 million people    the utility said about 312 000 customers in Northern California were still without power late Thursday  The adverse weather has mostly died down  and PG E said it would begin to inspect an unspecified subset of the 25 000 miles of transmission lines that were shutdown  a necessary precursor to restoring power 
Newsom called on California utility regulators to review PG E s actions  A spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission said the agency  as a policy  reviewed all intentional outages by California utilities 
PG E filed for bankruptcy in January  facing an estimated  30 billion in liabilities from two consecutive years of deadly wildfires blamed on its equipment 
CEO Bill Johnson  who took over in May  said the company made a determination that the blackouts were necessary for safety reasons  to ensure  zero risk  of sparks  He told reporters at a San Francisco press conference that started an hour after the governor s that it s  very likely  the company will need to cut power again in the future  Johnson said the utility will try to be more  surgical  about shutoffs 
 We Failed 
 This is not how we want to serve you  this is not how we want to run our business   he said   We are in the business of providing power  not taking it away  
Johnson and other PG E executives cited high wind speed measurements in 21 of the 33 counties affected and said they found fallen tree branches on some lines that could have caught fire 
The main failure was in communicating with customers about the outages  company officials said 
Johnson said the utility posted outage maps with inconsistent or inaccurate information  its website crashed and its call center was overwhelmed   We failed our customers   said Laurie Giammona  senior vice president and chief customer officer for PG E 
The CEO declined to respond directly to the governor s remarks  saying   I didn t come here to deal with the past  I came here to help improve the future  I haven t delved into all those matters  I might have some slight disagreement with the governor if I did

The company now expects costs for the year of  3 8 billion to  4 1 billion after tax  compared with  1 billion to  1 4 billion seen earlier 
The San Francisco based utility filed for bankruptcy this past January  citing potential liabilities of more than  30 billion stemming from the wildfires 
The forecast includes about  1 51 billion to  1 48 billion in costs for the 2017 Northern California wildfires and  1 61 billion to  1 58 billion related to the 2018 Camp Fire blaze 
The Camp Fire wildfire erupted in November of 2018  destroyed nearly 19 000 homes and killed 85   making it the deadliest single wildfire in California history 
In May  state fire investigators determined that PG E transmission lines caused the fire

216800,438316,PCG,PG E s Plan to Cap Fire Liabilities at  18 Billion Draws Outrage,news," Bloomberg     California utility giant PG E Corp   NYSE PCG  has issued its long awaited plan for emerging from the largest utility bankruptcy in U S  history  Raise debt  offer equity and cap the wildfire liabilities that led to its collapse at  18 billion    less than half of what victims and insurers have asked for 
Within hours of its release  the plan had sparked outrage 
The proposal is  a fraction of what wildfire victims would need to rebuild their lives   said Patrick McCallum  who co chairs a group representing victims of blazes that PG E s equipment has been blamed for sparking  The fires destroyed tens of thousands of structures across Northern California in 2017 and 2018  killed more than 100 people and buried the company in so many legal claims it was forced to file for Chapter 11 in January 
The plan PG E submitted in federal court on Monday kicks off the most contentious phase yet of a bankruptcy that has already attracted some of the biggest names in the financial world  including Pacific Investment Management Co  and Elliott Management Corp  Since the company s collapse    what has been described as climate change s largest financial casualty to date    wildfire victims  state politicians  activist investors and ratepayer advocates have clashed over the future of the company 
PG E Chief Financial Officer Jason Wells described the company s plan on Monday as a  crucial step in a multistep process  and said it may eventually be revised  depending on what the courts find the company legally responsible for paying 
 It s a framework   Wells said 
Mike Danko  a lawyer representing some wildfire victims  called it a plan that s  dead on arrival  
Wildfire Estimates
Complicating PG E s proposal is the fact that claims tied to the blazes are getting tallied as part of a separate court process that s only just begun  While the company has given estimates  it may be months before the utility has a clear picture of its actual liabilities 
Any exit plan hinges on that estimate  The official tally could lead to an entire rewrite of PG E s reorganization  A total that s higher than PG E is capable of paying threatens to wipe out current shareholders since  under the U S  Bankruptcy Code  fire victims would get paid in full first 
That puts PG E in a tenuous position as key creditor groups clamor to pitch their own restructuring proposals to U S  Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali  In August  Montali said he doesn t expect PG E s plan to be the final since some details aren t yet available  But he said the company must present something credible or else he may open the door to rival ones 
Meanwhile  time is running out for PG E  The company has until June to get out of bankruptcy if it wants to participate in a fund recently established by California to help utilities cover the cost of future fires  The alternative is facing the prospect of another catastrophic blaze that could force it into financial ruin once again 
Hitting Snags
PG E s plan has already hit some snags  A group led by Pimco and Elliott have been floating one plan that would all but wipe out the stakes of current stakeholders and hand control of the company over to them  They ve fought to have their proposal considered by Montali  PG E shareholders would keep their current holdings under the company s plan  but their stakes may be significantly diluted by new shares issued 
On Sept  6  a measure that would ve allowed the company to use tax free state bonds to pay off its fire claims stalled in California s legislature  And San Francisco is offering to buy some of the utility s local electrical assets for  2 5 billion  The city    PG E s hometown    sees the deal as an opportunity to save ratepayers money and fulfill its long held desire to break away from the company 
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
 A reportedly failed bid to use tax free state bonds to cover wildfire liabilities likely makes the sufficiency and nature of plan funding even more susceptible to attack

PG E filed its plan without an outline that describes in plain terms how creditors will be treated  That outline  known as a disclosure statement  typically helps creditors decide how to vote on the reorganization  Montali permitted PG E to put off filing it

216855,438371,PCG,PG E Files for Bankruptcy While Facing Billions in Fire Damages,news," Bloomberg     A series of devastating wildfires that killed more than 100 people and scorched hundreds of thousands of acres in California over the course of two years just brought one of the nation s largest utilities to its knees 
 NYSE PG E Corp    California s biggest power company  filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Northern California bankruptcy court as investigators probe whether its equipment ignited the deadliest fire in state history  The San Francisco based company listed more than  50 billion in estimated liabilities  A Chapter 11 filing allows a company to keep operating while it works out a plan to turn the business around and pay off creditors 
California s wildfires have in the past saddled utilities with millions of dollars in damages  but never have the blazes exacted such a massive financial toll from a company    creating one of the country s largest utility bankruptcies of all time  Since November s Camp fire  which destroyed the town of Paradise  PG E has seen about three fourths of its market value wiped out  its chief executive officer leave  its bonds plunge to junk status and estimates of its fire liabilities swell to more than  30 billion 
The only time the company s ever faced such dire financial straits was during the 2001 energy crisis when it was forced to place its utility unit in bankruptcy protection 
The utility giant s financial crisis had some of the biggest names in the investment world working up last minute financing packages that would rescue the company from insolvency to no avail  A consortium including Paul Singer s Elliott Management Corp  was said to have sent a proposal to PG E backed by  4 billion of bonds that could convert into shares  At least one other group that included Ken Griffin s Citadel LLC and Leon Black s Apollo Global Management LLC was said to be pitching a rival plan 
PG E s demise serves to underscore the increasing vulnerability utilities face to natural disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes that are becoming more extreme  That s especially the case in California  where state law holds utilities liable for damages even if they aren t found to be negligent 
While the company s been cleared of fault for the deadliest of the wildfires that devastated California s wine country in 2017  investigators have tied PG E s equipment to more than a dozen of the other fires and are looking at its power lines as a possible ignition source for the Camp Fire  which killed 86 
State officials including Governor Gavin Newsom had said it would be in the state s best interest to keep the utility healthy and financially viable  PG E is considered a linchpin in helping achieve California s ambitious climate goal of getting all its electricity from carbon free sources by 2045  At the same time  Newsom chose not to take measures drastic enough to avoid a bankruptcy filing  and regulators actually began a process to evaluate whether to break up or take over the utility 
A bankruptcy will probably result in higher bills for customers because it will be more expensive for PG E to borrow the money it needs to make infrastructure investments and keep the lights on  The company supplies natural gas and electricity to about 16 million people in Northern and Central California  PG E said Jan  22 it expects the bankruptcy to take about two years to resolve and arranged  5 5 billion to fund its operations during the process 
 With utilities  bankruptcies take multiple years   Kit Konolige  an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence  said in an interview before the filing   There is no such thing as a quick utility bankruptcy  And it creates a lot of uncertainty for everybody involved  ",2019-01-29,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pge-files-for-bankruptcy-while-facing-billions-in-fire-damages-1761012,1761012

216876,438392,PCG,A PG E Bankruptcy May Be What California Needs for a Utility Fix,news," Bloomberg     For days  California Governor Gavin Newsom and lawmakers deflected questions about what they d do to keep the state s largest utility  PG E Corp   NYSE PCG   from going under  On Monday  their response became clear  Not much 
At least not until the power giant has actually gone bankrupt 
Once the San Francisco based company has made a Chapter 11 filing    in what s likely to be one of the largest U S  utility bankruptcies of all time    California can jump into the case as a party and wield its power as one of the few entities that must sign off on the company s final plan to emerge  That leaves room for Newsom to still carry heavy weight in the outcome 
At a press conference Monday  the new Democratic governor began laying out what he wants  safety  reliability and affordability for Californians  even as PG E takes steps to address its  30 billion in potential wildfire liabilities  In a statement earlier that day  he also keyed in on a top priority  keeping the state on track to  make progress toward our climate goals  
The filing  viewed by some as the worst outcome  may actually help California decide what type of utility is right for a state with an ever increasing risk of multibillion dollar wildfires  according to Severin Borenstein  an energy economist at the University of California  Berkeley  Options such as breaking up the utility giant or turning it into government owned entities are likely to be hashed out in concert with the bankruptcy proceeding  he said 
 It will accelerate the discussion that was being had before bankruptcy  which is what is the appropriate structure of utilities given the increased wildfire risk   Borenstein said   If we are going to have investor owned utilities  how do we deal with the fact that they may face multibillion liabilities  
Deteriorating Finances
Newsom and other lawmakers showed little interest in bailing out the beleaguered company  PG E determined a bankruptcy filing was  the only viable option  to deal with its deteriorating finances after discussions with state officials  Steven Malnight  senior vice president of energy supply and policy at PG E s utility unit  said in an interview 
A bankruptcy reorganization would allow PG E to operate and keep the lights on as a court considers a restructuring that could save it 
And it would do something else   It diversifies the responsibility for what plays out   said Kit Konolige  a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence 
 So far  I would say the politicians have been very successful to avoid being the bad guy   he said   Clearly the one in the barrel is the utility  What politician is going to step up and say   I want to save PG E   
At the press conference late Monday  Newsom characterized the utility s woes as vastly different than the situation that led its utility unit to go bankrupt in 2001   We are not in an energy crisis   he said 
He said all options are on the table for the company   There s plenty we can do to influence  decisions  even though PG E s fate would be decided by a bankruptcy judge  he said 
 Vested Interest 
It s unlikely that the pressure will be off Newsom and the legislature to act  Chapter 11 gives creditors  the company and other stakeholders room to negotiate  which surely would include the state  said Stephen Nielander  adjunct lecturer at San Diego State University 
 You re really talking about a vital interest asset   Nielander said  The state has  a vested interest in our citizens being covered and protected  Does that get them a seat at the table  It s hard to imagine that they re not  
It may also pave the way for change in California s relationship with its power companies  PG E s move  underscores the reality that the state cannot regulate utilities as we have for the last 100 years   Betty Yee  the state s controller  said in a Twitter post 
 The state needs a complete assessment of our entire electricity grid   she said in a follow up email 
 Sufficient Resources 
The California Public Utilities Commission said it was closely monitoring PG E  as are the governor s office and state agencies  The commission would have to sign off on any rate increases or changes required to help the company exit a bankruptcy so would be part of any proceedings  Newsom said he ll be naming a representative to the regulator  very shortly  
 At this point  PG E has sufficient resources to continue to safely meet its core responsibilities and obligations   Terrie Prosper  a CPUC spokeswoman  said in an emailed statement 
PG E employs 20 000 people and provides power to more than 15 million  Its liabilities could grow from wildfires in 2017 and 2018  The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has blamed 17 of the 2017 blazes in part on company power lines and other equipment

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 12 12   A quarter ago  it was expected that this utility holding company would post earnings of  0 97 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 10  delivering a surprise of 13 40

PG E shares have lost about 70 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 22 7  
What s Next for PG E 
While PG E has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for PG E was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

216893,438409,PCG,Can Value Investors Consider Pacific Gas   Electric  PCG  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Pacific Gas   Electric Co    NYSE PCG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Pacific Gas   Electric has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 3 04  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 57  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Pacific Gas   Electric s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 13 58 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Utiities sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 83  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Pacific Gas   Electric has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 2 88  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Pacific Gas   Electric stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Pacific Gas   Electric has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 38x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Pacific Gas   Electric currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Pacific Gas   Electric a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  For example  the PEG ratio for Pacific Gas   Electric is just 1 15  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 3 81  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  PCG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though Pacific Gas   Electric might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of C  This gives PCG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen none estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen one up and none down in the same time period  This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 13 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Pacific Gas   Electric Co  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  Bottom LinePacific Gas   Electric is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 36  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Utilities Electric Power industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor ,2019-12-10,Zacks Investment

216910,438426,PCG,Will PG E  PCG  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  PG E  PCG   which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This utility holding company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 14 48  
For the most recent quarter  PG E was expected to post earnings of  0 97 per share  but it reported  1 10 per share instead  representing a surprise of 13 40   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 90 per share  while it actually produced  1 04 per share  a surprise of 15 56  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for PG E lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
PG E currently has an Earnings ESP of  3 03   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric

216922,438438,PCG,PG E Has More Downside Risk ,opinion,"Recently I ve come across a positively asymmetric  low risk   high reward  opportunity via buying puts on a utility firm that s recently entered bankruptcy 

I m talking about Pacific Gas   Electric Co  NYSE PCG    which is the holding company that owns the California utility firm Pacific Gas   Electricity  PG E  

But first   here s some context     

Pacific Gas   Electric was created in the mid 1800 s and is still the largest power provider in California   And one of the largest in the entire country  

They provide energy to over five million customers   and have many sources of generating power  such as wind  water  solar  nuclear  conventional  

Putting it simply   the firm s a massive power provider in one of the largest and wealthiest states in the U S 

But   fast forward to today   and PG E s now bankrupt  just filed Chapter 11 in January 2019  

 Keep in mind that this is the second time they ve entered bankruptcy   last time was in 2001 and later resumed operations in 2004  

So   what led to this 

For starters  years of mis using shareholder capital  Significant debt accumulation  And deferred maintenance of equipment put PG E in a very fragile position 

And   like most fragile things   they break once a  tipping point  is reached 

Well   that  tipping point  came in 2018     

The  Camp Fire   which was the deadliest and most destructive forest fire in California history  was the event that broke PG E 

To put things in perspective   this forest fire killed 85 people and destroyed nearly 19 000 homes  businesses  and commercial buildings 

And making matters worse   last month  May    the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection  aka Cal Fire  publicly announced that  after a very meticulous and thorough investigation    it has determined that the  Camp Fire  event was triggered by the  electrical transmission lines owned and operated by PG E      

 PG E also stated back in February that their equipment was most likely the cause of the  Camp Fire   

This put PG E directly liable for significant damages caused by their own  negligence   estimated at  30 plus billion in wildfire liabilities   which dwarves the firms  1 5 billion in fire insurance coverage  

Therefore   ballooning liabilities from last years  Camp Fire  incident   and further potential criminal and civil liabilities   pushed the already very leveraged and fragile company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy 

 There s already been new fires this month in California which have been linked to PG E s falling power lines  This indicates that their liabilities will soar even higher  

So   what now  

Well   currently   PG E stock trades for  24 00 per share  a roughly  12 billion market cap  

That s because shareholders still believe that after paying liabilities and creditors   they will still receive something 

For instance   back during the 2001 bankruptcy   shareholders came out looking very well   For those that held from the 2001 bankruptcy until September 2017 made over 700   

PG E was able to re pay the  10 billion they owed to creditors via a combination of existing cash and new debt 

But what really saved the firm was the de facto bailout from the State of California     

In short   the state bought PG E s spare electrical power  what they didn t sell to citizens  at artificially high market prices for about five years 

So   will this scenario happen this time around 

I m doubtful 

Actually   I believe PG E shares have much more downside compared to any upside potential  aka negatively asymmetric i e  huge downside   limited upside  

For starters   PG E s assets   in my opinion   aren t nearly worth as much as the market s expecting 

True   power companies have the ability to hike utility prices  cost of electricity   And most are forced to pay for it  unless the government steps in  

But still   PG E has destroyed significant shareholder value and has burned through lots of cash over the last 15 years  since coming out of their previous bankruptcy  

For instance   just over the last decade   the firm s generated nearly  9 billion in negative free cash flow     


This means that the firm hasn t grown organically  And has instead depended on both debt   10 5 billion worth over last 10 years  and selling stock   6 billion worth over last 10 years      



Thus   if PG E hasn t been able to generate any cash flow over the last 10 years  and instead binged on debt    I don t believe things will change in the future  

 Keep in mind that the firm has mounting liabilities compared to cash  According to the recent PG E filing  Mar 2019    the firm has only  3 billion in cash  But has  5 billion due in short term liabilities   14 billion in wildfire claims  And  69 billion in total liabilities   this isn t even counting the additional wildfire claims they owe in excess of  30 billion  

Another hit to shareholders is the fact that there are creditors sitting on  8 billion worth of unsecured bonds  aka debt that s not backed by any collateral  that want to take a chance at reorganizing the company 

This means that   if the plan s accepted   it would raise  30 billion of cash  And  18 billion of that would come from selling new shares   They also want to rename the company  Golden State Power Light   Gas Co    

This would significantly dilute current shareholders  meaning their piece of the  corporate pie  would be much smaller  

So   in summary   the key takeaway here is that it will take many billions to get PG E whole again 

Liabilities such as  mounting wildfire claims   repaying creditors   employee pensions   and re investing in  outdated  infrastructure must be paid 

 Note that all these must be paid first before shareholders can receive anything   i e  what s left over  

Don t forget that it s already been six months since PG E filed Chapter 11  And they still haven t submitted a plan to reorganize 

Now   with the 2019 fire season underway in California   there could be even more wildfire damage   Which is already happening  

This means even more claims PG E must pay      

So here s the big question  will PG E shareholders get anything after they restructure 

Who knows 

But I believe it will be considerably less than the current share price of  24 per share 

Or said another way   I believe PG E shareholders own more liabilities than assets  

And because of this   I m buying long dated  way out of the money  put options on  PCG  Since I expect shareholders will be wiped out over the coming year s

216923,438439,PCG,Earnings Preview  PG E  PCG  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects PG E  PCG  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 97 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 4  
Revenues are expected to be  4 30 billion  up 1 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4 85  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PG E 
For PG E  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PG E will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PG E would post earnings of  0 90 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 04  delivering a surprise of  15 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PG E doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-pge-pcg-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200441394,200441394
216924,438440,PCG,PG E  PCG  Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates,opinion,"PG E  PCG  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 10 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 97 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 16 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 13 40   A quarter ago  it was expected that this utility holding company would post earnings of  0 90 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 04  delivering a surprise of 15 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
PG E  which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  posted revenues of  3 94 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 28   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 23 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
PG E shares have lost about 22 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17 2  
What s Next for PG E 
While PG E has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for PG E was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 98 on  4 40 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 82 on  17 35 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

216945,438461,PCG,Can PG E  PCG  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider PG E  PCG   This company  which is in the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this utility holding company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 14 96   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  PG E was expected to post earnings of  0 62 per share  but it reported  0 80 per share instead  representing a surprise of 29 03   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 12 per share  while it actually produced  1 13 per share  a surprise of 0 89  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for PG E lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
PG E currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 36   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-pge-pcg-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200404305,200404305

PG E shares have lost about 8 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 6  
What s Next for PG E 
While PG E has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for PG E was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 04 on  4 43 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 88 on  17 56 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

216960,438476,PCG,PG E  PCG  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"PG E  PCG  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 62 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 6  
Revenues are expected to be  4 29 billion  up 4 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PG E 
For PG E  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 23  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that PG E will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PG E would post earnings of  1 12 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 13  delivering a surprise of  0 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PG E appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pge-pcg-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200390897,200390897

216971,438487,PCG,PG E  PCG  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q4 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when PG E  PCG  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 62 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 6  
Revenues are expected to be  4 29 billion  up 4 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PG E 
For PG E  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 61  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that PG E will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PG E would post earnings of  1 12 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 13  delivering a surprise of  0 89

Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  3 82 per share and revenue of  17 16 billion  These totals would mark changes of  3 8  and  0 17   respectively  from last year 
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for PCG  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook

217000,438516,PCG,Should Value Investors Buy PG E  PCG  Stock ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment 
One stock to keep an eye on is PG E  PCG   PCG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value  The stock is trading with P E ratio of 6 13 right now  For comparison  its industry sports an average P E of 13 19  Over the last 12 months  PCG s Forward P E has been as high as 14 02 and as low as 4 43  with a median of 11 27 
Investors should also note that PCG holds a PEG ratio of 1 75  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  PCG s industry currently sports an average PEG of 2 19  Over the last 12 months  PCG s PEG has been as high as 3 54 and as low as 1 26  with a median of 2 71 
Investors should also recognize that PCG has a P B ratio of 0 64  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks attractive against its industry s average P B of 1 70  PCG s P B has been as high as 1 41 and as low as 0 47  with a median of 1 16  over the past year 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  PCG has a P S ratio of 0 71  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 84 
Finally  we should also recognize that PCG has a P CF ratio of 4 04  This metric takes into account a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 6 70  Over the past year  PCG s P CF has been as high as 8 09 and as low as 2 93  with a median of 5 12

217008,438524,PCG,The Week Ahead  Which Stocks Benefit Most From Trump Policy Changes  ,opinion,"The economic calendar is normal  but there will be a lot of competing news   Korean talks  China negotiations  and the Trump legal team s announcement about whether the President will meet with Special Counsel Mueller  And those are just the items we know about 
Sometimes there are great themes that do not get the deserved attention in financial media  Readers have encouraged me to identify and discuss such themes  and this week provides a good opportunity  Pundits should be asking 
Which equity sectors benefit most from Trump policy changes 
Last Week Recap
In my last edition of WTWA I asked why stocks were  stuck in neutral  given the recent economic strength and the strong corporate earnings  I also noted the significance of the week s inflation data  even though the Fed s favorite gauge was not on the calendar  That was all quite accurate  It was the key topic at the start of the week  and stocks responded well to the tame inflation data released mid week 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart  I especially like the S P 500 version updated each week  She includes a lot of valuable information in a single visual  The full post has even more charts and analysis  so check it out 

The market had a nice rally  up 2 4  for the week  The trading range was about 3 4   consistent with recent volatility  I summarize actual and implied volatility each week in our Indicator Snapshot section below  As you can see  volatility has been moving lower  and is back into the long term range 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
Feel free to add items that I have missed  Please keep in mind that we are looking for current news  especially from the last week or so  WTWA is not about long term concerns like debt  These are important  of course  but not our weekly subject unless there has been some major change 
The overall picture remains positive  Economic strength is reasonable  and inflation is low   analysis of high frequency indicators shows some deterioration but retains the overall outlook 
The Good

NFIB small business optimism nudged higher to 104 8 vs  104 7 last month and expected  The record of improved profits was the highest in the 45 year history of the survey    
Hotel occupancy is on pace for a record year     
Bank lending is getting easier  New Deal Democrat notes that an ongoing criticism of the economy has been the deceleration of commercial and industrial loans  The Senior Loan Officer Survey tends to lead lending by about six months  He concludes   Credit remains loose  and indicates continuing economic growth over the next 12 months  
JOLTS showed labor market strength  Nick Bunker provides the best analysis of this report  covering and interpreting all the key elements  This month there is a small rebound in the quits rate  the all time low of the ratio between unemployed workers and open jobs  and the overall structure represented in the Beveridge curve 



Inflation remained tame  The PPI increased 0 1  with the core up 0 2   The CPI increased 0 2  with the core up 0 1   These reports comforted observers who are concerned about Fed rate hikes  Jill Mislinski provides an  X Ray View  of inflation component using year over year changes instead of seasonal adjustments  James Picerno observers that the data are unlikely to influence Fed policy 



Initial jobless claims matched last week s low of 211K and beat expectations of 220K 

The Bad

Oil and gasoline prices move higher  Iran sanctions  the Venezuelan economic crisis  and seasonality are all factors    



No progress in the US China trade talks  Some were optimistic since the delegations included top level officials    

The Ugly
The Central States Pension Fund is expected to be insolvent in seven years     Some businesses in the plan have failed  and investments have not met expected returns 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
The economic calendar is normal  with an emphasis housing data  Retail sales and industrial production are important  and some swear by the leading indicators  Geopolitical and investigation news may once again claim the spotlight 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
It may well be a big week for news  but there is no clear focus for the punditry  Don t worry  They will find a way to fill the air time  I am taking the occasion to discuss a topic that should be getting more attention  Pundits and financial writers should be asking 
What sectors benefit most from the Trump policy changes 
Please note that this is an investment question  not a political one  A good investor is politically agnostic but must also be realistic  Policy changes are facts and the gauging the likely investment impacts is analysis  We know much more about Trump policies than we did at the start of his term  There are several key effects worth further research  In the list below  I sometimes include a link which provides a viewpoint or analysis as a starting point  The links do not necessarily represent my personal views  Good research requires considering all sides  I have included  in brackets  a few comments of my own  The topics are all worth further study with significant investment implications 

Trade policy  Fortune s CEO Daily is one of my daily reads  Today there was an  of the China trade situation with links taking a US viewpoint and a China viewpoint  The source material included a pro China article from the   and a pro US article from the  



The estimates of the hit to GDP is a reduction in growth of 0 3  for China and even less for the US  Could the trade conflict expand   the overall economic effects of US Import restraints  Few understand that many products have a complicated history of contributions and cross many borders  Here is a fascinating example 


Housing  Construction costs are increasing   both materials    and land  The WSJ suggests that the next housing crisis could be a     Lumber prices are higher partly because of the tariff on Canadian imports  in retaliation for their tariff on US milk  Regulations restrict development in many areas  Interest rates are a bit higher   I still like this sector because of the demographic forces and obvious need for more supply  There is always a market clearing price  
Energy prices  Increases might threaten the US economy     but will be good for  
Tax policy   that tax revenues have increased  a result he attributes to the lower rates from the  Trump tax cut   He suggests   With just the tiniest bit of spending restraint  we could see the budget deficit hold steady or decline between now and year end    It is pretty early in the game to draw conclusions here  


Economic growth  Looking a bit better with current  nowcast  results of 3 4   Worries  Immigration limitations hit potential growth as do trade restrictions  In total  these may reduce GDP by more than 1    We are still headed for solid growth  but it will be less than it might have been  
Net neutrality  Under FCC control  and the Trump panel ended the policy  The Senate may force a vote on this issue  but it appears to be mostly symbolic       I originally expected serious Congressional resistance  but it never really developed  
Drug prices  This week s big announcement about lowering drug prices was    My long term opinion has been that the demand for important drugs is strong  the balance between development costs and price must be addressed  Finally  the President has little power  beyond the bully pulpit  to have a big impact  So far  the stocks reflect the political commentary  

As usual  I ll save my overall personal conclusions for today s Final Thought

Risk Analysis
I have a rule for my investment clients  Think first about your risk  Only then should you consider possible rewards  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update 
The Indicator Snapshot

Short term trading conditions have improved  The borderline rating was almost poor enough to take our trading models out of the market  A strength of our modeling approach  Thanks  Vince   is a touch more patience than shown by many technical systems  This has a mild cost  and can reap great rewards  This week was a good example  We continue to monitor the technical health measures on a daily basis  The long term fundamentals and outlook are little changed 
A notable feature of the chart is that we have increased the nine month recession odds to a chance of 25   While this is significantly higher than it has been during the rally  it does not yet represent a real threat  Instead of thinking of the odds as higher than before  we must keep in mind the continuing evidence that a near term recession is unlikely  The odds are only slightly higher than the long term average 
That said  we watch this quite closely and plan to reduce position sizes if the risk grows much larger

I made a polite objection on Twitter  noting that no one could forecast a recession more than a year ahead of time  and that the age of the economic cycle was not predictive  I got a polite reply  but I understand that his job is to report the WSJ survey  There must be a better process for covering recession potential  You could  for example  focus on those with special expertise on this topic  instead of looking to generalists 
James Picerno does his  at those predicting recessions  Read the entire post to see the range of speculation lacking method  Read the prior two installments to see some  forecasting  history  As I have also recently noted  he sees the bogus forecasts as moving farther out in time to improve the odds

If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be behavioral scientist Steve Wendel s article    He takes four of the common cognitive biases and shows why they are useful in everyday life  He has a great example of how well they work on hamburgers  Feel free to substitute your favorite food  he invites  He then applies the same useful heuristics to investing  I cannot quote much without giving away the whole story  so please read this excellent  brief post 

The decisions our minds make  which we call biases in the context of investing  are actually quite smart  Investment biases are smart shortcuts  applied to the wrong situation  Thus  there s a very good reason why they are difficult to overcome  they generally help us  Since we can t simply ignore them or easily override them  we have to acknowledge them and work with them or around them  Everyone has them  advisors  fund managers  pension investment committees  etc  Our investment biases are a natural part of how our minds are wired  they don t disappear because someone has a particular base of expertise in investing

Final Thoughts
Finding attractive stocks is easier when you have the demographic  political  and economic winds at your back 
While I certainly do not have all the answers about the impact of Trump policy initiatives  there is now some clarity  Here are some strong approaches 

Spot improving sectors  Some have benefited while others have not  Brian  how the sector earnings and revenue estimates have changed  This is a factual  non political account   just the kind of information we seek  While all sectors have improved  there are some clear cut winners and laggards 


Get ahead of the capital flows   Davidson     notes that these flows always occur after events become well known  He analyzes in detail the relationship between the dollar  oil prices  and the perceived economic effects  He concludes 

Current trends in multiple economic indicators  covered in recent notes  speak to continued global economic expansion  The pace of this expansion is likely to surprise many by its strength  Recent earnings reports and forecasts for the next few years by well known and respected CEOs in multiple sectors remain very positive  The current gloom should dissipate fairly quickly 


It is important to look beyond absolute prices of individual stocks and the market  If avoiding new highs was your only investment rule  you could never participate in a rising market  Dr  Ed Yardeni notes 

The forward P E has been very noisy so far this year on fears of higher inflation  tighter Fed policy  and trade protectionism  It has masked the underlying bullish trend of the S P 500 forward earnings  Thanks to Trump s tax cuts at the end of last year  this weekly measure of industry analysts  consensus estimates for earnings over the coming 52 weeks has been soaring since the start of the year 
My Boom Bust Barometer  BBB   which is the ratio of the CRB raw industrials spot price index to initial unemployment claims  continues to be highly correlated with S P 500 forward earnings  The BBB rose to a record high at the end of April  The BBB is also highly correlated with the S P 500 stock price index  but less so than with forward earnings  That s because there is more noise than signal in the S P 500 than in forward earnings as a result of the short term volatility of the P E

217010,438526,PCG,PG E  PCG  Q3 Earnings Surpass Estimates,opinion,"PG E  PCG  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 13 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 12 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 12 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0 89   A quarter ago  it was expected that this utility holding company would post earnings of  0 95 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 16  delivering a surprise of 22 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
PG E  which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  posted revenues of  4 38 billion for the quarter ended September 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 67   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 52 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
PG E shares have added about 5 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 9  
What s Next for PG E 
While PG E has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions
