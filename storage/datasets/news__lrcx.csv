3799,225314,LRCX,Wall Street Week Ahead  Tech haves and have nots face third quarter tests,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK  Reuters    Technology companies  which make up the largest swath of the U S  stock market  are expected to post a nearly 8  drop in third quarter profits as reports roll in next week from many of the sector s biggest corporations 
But below the surface  the estimates reveal a wide range among the companies that comprise the S P 500 information technology sector  SPLRCT   which includes Apple Inc  O AAPL    Microsoft Corp   O MSFT  as well as communications equipment  hardware and IT services companies 
The overall sector s earnings performance is being dragged down by semiconductors  which are expected to post a nearly 27  plunge in quarterly profits  according to IBES data from Refinitiv  as analysts point to impact from the U S  China tariff conflict and generally weak demand 
Growing business IT spending continues to support other pockets of tech  according to investors  Software firms are poised for a nearly 11  gain in profits from a year ago  according to the IBES data from Refinitiv 
 You may have two dynamics going on in tech in the opposite direction   said John Augustine  chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus  Ohio   Can software live up to the numbers and will semis beat the numbers  
Among software companies  Microsoft  the largest U S  company by market value  reports results on Wednesday  while earnings are also due next week from semiconductor stalwarts  Intel Corp   O INTC  and Texas Instruments Inc  O TXN  
Other tech earnings next week include payment processors  PayPal Holdings Inc   O PYPL  and  Visa Inc   N V   with iPhone maker Apple  whose results ripple through its supply chain  expected to post a 2 7  drop in earnings when it reports the following week 
One of the early reporters  International Business Machines Corp  N IBM   kicked off the season on a sour note on Wednesday  with quarterly revenue that missed estimates 
 GRAPHIC   Tech s third quarter outlook   
Even with the disparate forecasts for the third quarter company results  tech stocks are outshining the market broadly in 2019 
The S P 500 tech sector  which comprises over one fifth of the benchmark index  has climbed more than 30  in 2019  compared to a 19  rise for the S P 500  SPX  
Federal Reserve easing of interest rates has helped the performance  which comes despite uncertainty about the health of the global economy and about U S  China trade tensions 
Tech is  the primary growth engine of the economy   said David Joy  chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  in Boston 
 China is an issue for them  but at the same time they continue to grow and they continue to innovate   Joy said   You have to have exposure in technology  We just think as you look around at the market landscape  it s one of the better places to be right now  
The tech sector s strength is broad based  including gains so far this year of about 30  or more from the four biggest industry groups by market value within the tech sector  software   IT services   hardware  storage   peripherals  and semiconductors  
 The IT budget continues to garner more dollars from the general budget of Corporate America   said Michael Seidenberg  portfolio manager for the global technology team at Allianz  DE ALVG  Global Investors   There will be winners and losers within the sector  but I think generally speaking that is a trend that has persisted  
Of U S  corporations  semiconductor makers are seen as among the most affected by the U S  China trade tensions  which have triggered big swings in their shares 
But the stocks still have prospered  the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index  SOX  has climbed nearly 40  this year to all time highs  while three chip stocks   KLA Corp  O KLAC    Lam Research Corp   O LRCX   Advanced Micro Devices Inc  O AMD    are the tech sector s biggest 2019 gainers 
Despite the steep decline in third quarter profits projected for S P 500 semiconductor companies  analysts are optimistic there will be improvement soon  with semiconductors expected to post an 11  rise in 2020 earnings  according to Refinitiv data 
 To me  there s a huge disconnect between the performance of these names and the underlying fundamentals   said Daniel Morgan  senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta 
For software and other tech companies  the third quarter can be seasonally weak  said Kim Forrest  chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh  who said she would be looking for executives to comment on whether business is being pushed back to future quarters 
But the strong employment market has supported tech stocks  Forrest said 
 This a phenomenon you see in the late stages of an expansion   Forrest said   Hiring is up and to support all the new people that you ve hired  you to add to your technology  ",2019-10-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-street-week-ahead-tech-haves-and-havenots-face-thirdquarter-tests-1999088,1999088

The rally was pushed by gains in technology and communications services  which translates basically into big tech stocks  including Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Google parent Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   All of those stocks hit new highs 
Banks also saw new highs

The Dow Jones industrials were up 0 5   thanks to gains for Microsoft  Apple and JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   but was off about 1 1  from its high 
The catalysts were expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its key interest rate on Wednesday and bullishness about Alphabet  which reported postmarket today and Apple  which reports fiscal fourth quarter results after Wednesday s close 
Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  shares were 0 8  lower after hours after its earnings missed analyst estimates because of heavy marketing spending  even as revenue jumped 20  to  40 5 billion

With Monday s close  the S P 500 was up 21  for the year  with the Dow up 16 1  and the Nasdaq up 25 5

Thanks  Tina  and welcome  everyone  In the December quarter Lam delivered revenues and diluted earnings per share above the midpoint of guidance  marking another quarter of solid execution and closing out a year of strong performance in calendar 2019  Consistent with our comments throughout this year  we entered 2020 with increasing momentum and an improved spending mix environment which we believe will lead to outperformance by Lam  I have now completed my first year as CEO of Lam Research and I am incredibly proud of what our people have achieved  Underpinning our strong financial results this past year has been a companywide focus on execution and an emphasis on our culture  where all employees can perform their best  I want to thank Lam s employees across our global organization for their efforts and of course  our partners and customers for their value and support  I also want to take a moment to address the coronavirus situation 
Our concern first and foremost is with the health and well being of our employees  customers and partners  And with this in mind we have implemented precautionary measures within our global business operations  Additionally we are donating to Chinese relief efforts to support the people and communities impacted by the coronavirus outbreak  Now turning to our business results  In calendar 2019  we generated solid operating cash flows and at the same time we invested a company record in research and development dollars to fuel technology innovation and product differentiation  Our EPS performance  the second best in the company s 40 year history was especially noteworthy given that memory spending declined significantly year over year in 2019  The impact of lower memory spending was partially mitigated by record revenue from our customer support business group  highlighting the importance of our recurring spares and service opportunity to the overall quality of earnings of the company  In 2019 we also saw outstanding execution in our product organizations  We grew our revenue share of WFE spend in memory and foundry logic and we laid the foundation for additional gains as we recorded our best ever performance in net penetration and defense application wins as measured by revenue potential over the next three years 
We are winning by focusing on high volume manufacturing solutions for emerging technology inflection challenges including those associated with new scaling architectures  new memory technologies  and new materials  We are capitalizing on the learning from our installed base of tools that today enable some of the industry s most critical etch and deposition applications  For example for the three most critical applications in 3D NAND  our Strata  ALTUS  and Flex tools each process well over 1 million wafers per month in high volume manufacturing allowing us to partner early and in a unique way with our customers on next generation needs  In 2019  this led to the addition of new products to our portfolio such as the Vector DT which is designed to address wafer stress problems encountered during the high volume production of 3D NAND stacks of 96 layers and above  Similarly  we enhanced the capabilities of our Coronus product family to improve device yield at the wafer edge by depositing encapsulating layers for bevel protection 
These products expand our served share of WFE spend  but just as importantly  they exemplify our commitment to our customers  success  In 2019 we improved to the number one or number two position at all of our largest customers that provide a competitive ranking of their suppliers based on detailed quality  support  and performance scorecards  In part  this improvement is due to our investment in productivity enhancing upgrades for our installed base  For instance  Corvus wafer edge solutions have become key differentiators for our conductor and dielectric etch systems in high volume manufacturing and have been instrumental in helping our customers reduce cost of ownership  We announced in 2019 a Corvus enabled self maintaining etch tool that ran for one year in high volume manufacturing without human intervention  Multiple customers are now upgrading their installed base tools to include this high value added capability  In 2019  we highlighted heterogeneous integration and advanced packaging as new areas of opportunity to leverage our product portfolio and 3D learning to drive growth 
In the December quarter  we built on our growing momentum in this space with additional wins for our SABRE 3D electroplating system at multiple advanced packaging customers  With these latest wins  we estimate that we have gained more than 15 points of market share in the last two years and we have firmly established ourselves as the technology leader in the increasingly important through silicon via Marine  Another area of growth for the company has been an atomic layer deposition or ALD  Our ALD solutions are gaining significant traction in the market by delivering best in class film properties along with high productivity and low defects  Due to the inherent advantages of higher film quality and comparability  our Striker ALD oxide systems are replacing older process alternatives such as spin on dielectric and SACVD for critical applications  pulling more WFE spending into our served market  Similarly  RC scaling requirements are driving increased demand for our single wafer Striker carbide and ALTUS ALD metallization systems  When used for locate carbide liner spacer applications   our Striker system has been able to achieve 30  better RC properties versus competing batch tools  For metallization  we closed out 2019 on a high note with significant wins in Logic Foundry for our ALTA systems as customers look to replace the conventional barrier fill sequence with an integrated ALD approach to lower device resistance and cost effective way 
Across all products we exited 2019 with approximately 61 000 chambers in our installed base  Our installed base revenues grew year over year and reached record levels in 2019 with significant contribution from our reliant business which also reached record levels  Productivity upgrades and solutions grew more than 30  year over year as we have worked to help customers enhance the performance of their existing assets  Furthermore  we signed several new multiyear customer support contracts  These multiyear contracts enable Lam to significantly reduce customers  running costs  while generating a recurring revenue stream for Lam  Now turning to WFE  we estimate 2019 WFE ended in the  46 million to  47 billion range slightly higher than our prior mid  40 billion estimate  The increase was driven predominantly by higher Foundry Logic spending  For calendar 2020 assuming no material impact from Coronavirus on our full year outlook  our view calls for WFE spend in the mid to high  50 billion range supported by sustained strong spending in foundry and logic and significantly for Lam  improved spending in memory led first by NAND  Overall we expect spending in Memory and Foundry Logic segments to be up year on year in 2020  To wrap up Lam delivered strong financial performance in calendar 2019  And as our March quarter guidance suggest  we are in a great position to drive higher in 2020 with the improvement in memory spending  Lam s product pipeline is very strong with more innovation on the way and we look forward to sharing more with you at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3  Thanks  And now here s Doug 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Great  Thank you  Tim  Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today in the middle of what I know is a very busy earnings season  We concluded calendar year 2019 with a strong December quarterly performance  Results ended up better than we expected  primarily due to a little bit stronger NAND investment  as well as an uptick in our installed base business  Our installed base business delivered another record year and continued to be a stable profitable business for us  And as Tim mentioned from an earnings per share perspective  it was the second best year in our 40 year history  The December quarter results came in over the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics with diluted earnings per share essentially at the high end of our guidance range  As Tim also noted we re pleased with our performance in calendar year 2019 and we delivered solid profitability levels within a challenging memory environment 
As we discussed at our earnings call last quarter there were continued strong investments in the Foundry and Logic segments in the December quarter  We had the highest system revenue dollars for the Foundry segment in our history and the revenue concentration was at its highest level since the September 2016 quarter  Foundry spending continued its focus on the 7 nanometer and 5 nanometer nodes and it represented 36  of our December quarter system revenue  The Logic and other segment grew in dollar terms and was essentially flat with the prior quarter intensity level coming in at 12  of system revenues  It was the highest logic and other revenue level in dollar terms in two years  driven by 10 nanometer  image sensors  and other specialty markets  For memory  the combined segment decreased to 52  of system revenues from the September quarter which was at 64   We had a decrease in the December quarter in the non volatile memory segment going from 38  to 35   However  from a dollar perspective  revenue in the segment actually increased  The DRAM segment decreased from 26  to 17  of system revenue  NAND investment continues to be focused on 64  96  and initial 128 layer devices  And DRAM spending continues to be primarily focused on node transitions 
Revenues for the quarter were  2 584 billion which was above the midpoint  In addition to the leading edge foundry and logic strength I mentioned  we saw continued investments in the China region with the majority again coming from domestic Chinese customers  China geographic revenue came in at 29  of total revenue in December  Gross margin came in at 45 7   70 basis points above the midpoint  Strength in the December quarter gross margin is related to customer and product mix as well as increased factory utilization levels relative to the prior quarter  I ll remind you as I always do that actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volumes product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see some variability quarter to quarter  Operating expenses for the December quarter came in at  481 million  Our variable compensation spending was higher in the quarter as it s tied to the increased level of profitability  Spending in the December quarter also increased due to the appreciation of the market during the quarter and the resulting impact on the cost of our deferred compensation plan  As I ve mentioned in the past  we do hedge this to mitigate the exposure to the income statement  However  because of the accounting rules the offset to this expense shows up in other income and expense 
It s basically a neutral impact to earnings per share at the end of the day  We continue to invest in our critical research and development programs and you ll hear more about our commitment to technology and productivity leadership at our upcoming Investors Day in March  I d also remind you that as we look ahead to the 2020 calendar year  we ll see the normal seasonal spending increases related to the March quarter  Operating income in the December quarter was  700 million and operating margin was 27 1   essentially at the midpoint of guidance  Our non GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 12 5  I would like to highlight that the difference between the non GAAP tax rate and the December quarter GAAP tax rate which was 23 5  was related to the reversal of the tax benefit from the Altera stock based compensation case  I think you re seeing this from lots of companies in the technology space  You should expect the fluctuations in the tax rate will occur quarter to quarter  And as we look into the rate for the calendar year 2020  I expect it to be in the low teens level  Other income expense was up slightly from the prior quarter at a total of approximately  13 million in expense 
The main components of OI E our interest income from our cash and investment balances offset by interest expense related to the outstanding debt  You should expect that other income and expense will fluctuate quarter to quarter based on several market related items things like foreign exchange or what I m talking about  Moving on to capital return  for the December quarter  167 million of cash was deployed in dividends and  1 billion in share repurchase  As we frequently done in the past  the share repurchases were done through a structured share repurchase program that cover repurchases through the June 2020 quarter  We remain on track with our commitment to capital return  For calendar year 2019  we completed  3 billion of our current  5 billion buyback authorization  In total our capital return activities represented approximately 158  of free cash flow in 2019  Diluted earnings per share was  4 01  Our diluted shares continue to decline and we ended the December quarter with diluted shares at approximately 150 million shares  This is the eighth consecutive quarter where our diluted share count has declined 
The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes  And I ll remind you that the dilution schedule for the 2041 converts is available on our IR website for your reference  Let me now move to the balance sheet  Our cash and short term investments including restricted cash decreased in the December quarter to  4 9 billion from  5 8 billion in the September quarter  The decrease quarter to quarter was due to the share repurchase and dividend activity offset by cash flows from operations of  308 million  And as I ve mentioned before  when you see business levels grow working capital levels generally increase which impacted our cash flow from operations in December  We concluded calendar year 2019 with the second highest level of free cash flow in the company s history at over  2 3 billion  I believe this truly demonstrates the sustainability of our business through a lower industry spend period  DSO increased slightly due to the timing of collections to 72 days versus 69 days in the prior quarter  Inventory turns improved to 3 7 turns from 3 2 in the September quarter  Both receivables and inventory grew in dollars during December as business levels increased  Non cash expenses include approximately  46 million for equity compensation  49 million for depreciation and  17 million for amortization  December quarter capital expenditures increased to  62 million from  39 million in the September quarter 
And in headcount as of the December quarter was flat with the prior quarter at approximately 10 700 regular full time employees  We expect that as revenue levels are growing  we ll add headcount to support the increasing business  So now looking ahead  I d like to provide our non GAAP guidance for the march 2020 quarter  We re expecting revenue of  2 800 billion plus or minus  200 million  Gross margin of 46 5  plus or minus one percentage point  operating margins of 28  plus or minus one percentage point and finally earnings per share of  4 55 plus or minus  0 4 based on a share count of approximately 149 million shares  We see continued strength in foundry and logic spending going into the March quarter  And additionally we see NAND spending continue to increase going into 2020  The March quarter guidance reflects our current view of the business environment including our assessment with the potential impact from the public health situation in China  We see business disruptions potentially with both customers and suppliers that are essentially extending the Lunar New Year holiday through February 9th 
Absent this situation  our numbers would have been somewhat higher  We also increased the revenue and EPS ranges to take into consideration the uncertainty of the impact from these activities  We believe this is temporary  but the issue is developing day by day  I think we re taking a prudent approach to what we re doing with the numbers  So  to conclude  we re well positioned heading into 2020  We re on a strong trajectory to outperform based on our product portfolio as well as operational strategies  And that concludes my prepared remarks  Operator  Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions 
Questions and Answers 
Operator
 Operator Instructions  And our first question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse 
John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst
My first question just is going to focus in on the domestic China market  Doug you were kind enough to tell us it was the majority of the China business in the December quarter  I m wondering if you can help us understand how much of a majority it was  And what was the split between sort of memory and logic  And then as you look out to your WFE forecast growth of at least 20  in calendar year 2020  how important is the domestic China market  And how should we think about the memory versus sort of the logic foundry side of that 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  I ll answer it and then I ll let Tim add on  John I m not going to get into the habit every quarter of giving a precise quantification except to tell you the majority in the December quarter was from domestic China  And that s been the case the last couple of quarters  And the reason I ve been mentioning that over the last couple of quarters is it s different than the last several years have been where the majority has actually come from the global multinationals  Then your question relative to how we re looking into 2020 in China  I think 2019 probably finished with WFE from the local China customers a little bit above  6 billion  something like that and it s growing in 2020  And as we look into 2020 I think John probably it s up  2 billion to  3 billion is my best guess from local China  And that spending is broad based  it s NAND  it s DRAM  it s foundry and logic  So  it s not one or the other  it s a broad based set of customer spending  Tim you want to add anything 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
No I think that pretty much covers it 
John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst
And then as my follow on just on WFE and kind of your share  Tim as you talked about in your prepared comments  you did a nice job kind of gaining your share of WFE  Is 2020 a year where that becomes a little bit more difficult with sort of the addition of EUV  Or how important is the EUV to your growth projections this year  And as we think about EUV deployment  is that a good leading indicator for your future business or how should we think about that 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
Well  yes  I think that we ve talked about EUV a number of times  And so I guess maybe I ll just repeat a few of the things I ve said and maybe add a couple of comments  In general  what we ve said is that technology transitions themselves are very good for Lam  We have highlighted a number of times that Lam s served market actually grows at each technology node within foundry logic even with the introduction of EUV  So  really what we want is we want the market and our customers to be able to keep moving their technologies forward  Specific to patterning as you move from phase seven to 5 nanometer  even in the case of EUV what you re starting to see is  the increased use of more high quality hard masks moving away from spin on dielectrics toward deposition methods like PCD where Lam has a very strong position 
And so  you know  in many cases our Sam is actually increasing because we re pulling in applications that before we re actually done with older processes  and now they re coming into our more critical space  And so with that  we see Sam increase and therefore even with the EUV we see a growing market for ourselves  Doug talked about your highest dollars from foundry logic and that s just I think further evidence because we re seeing technology investments right now at those the nodes  Now as far as the leading indicator for what we said is that  EUV is obviously those shipments or signs of these more complex technology nodes and again our Sam gross or opportunity gross 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And then John the only  only thing I would add as you think about wallet share of WFE going into 2020  I think  you know  our SAM and sharing NAND is very good  And clearly 2020  our view is going to be a stronger investment period for the NAND industry as we ve seen kind of pricing and profitability stabilize  So our share a wallet actually in addition to the EUV commentary Tim had is  is actually going to have a tail end from the fact that NAND spending I think will be stronger

All right  Thank you  Our next question comes from C J  Muse with Evercore 
C J  Muse    Evercore    Analyst
I guess first question on WFE  if you think about the    you know roughly  8 billion to  10 billion increase year on year into 2020  Can you tell us  how much of that is memory versus foundry logic  You know is that kind of an 80 20 split and then  as part of that  are you including the material uplift and DRAM within that or is that something that can be a source of further upside 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay  great  Great question  I don t think we re going to give you the exact breakout  but I think we ve characterized it as  I think  you know  maybe you can look back to what we said is we were exiting last year  What we said was that  we were seeing very strong spending and Foundry Logic and that we were just starting to see the early signs of improvement in NAND and we felt that DRAM would come after the NAND market is improved  And so I think what you re seeing in our outlook for 2020 is that starting to play out  Except for again  sustained strong spending in founder and logic  So maybe the emphasis on sustained and a strong uptick in NAND spending which as Doug just commented is a significant tailwind for us in terms of our SAM as a percent of WFE  Relative to DRAM  I think we characterize last year primarily as a technology investment year with very little capacity additions  And I would say that in general our outlook at this year is that  that doesn t change much at least until much later in the year  So I d say primarily sustained strong Foundry and Logic spending    foundry and logic and strong uptick in NAND 
C J  Muse    Evercore    Analyst
Great  And as a follow up question on the service side  you know  thank you for providing the installed base numbers very helpful  So I think 12  in calendar 2018 up 9  in calendar 2019  Can you help us kind of think about what the growth rate for service could look like  And is it fair to say that service in 2019 reached roughly mid 30s of total revenues  Thank you 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So I ll take the last one  Yeah  it wasn t quite that high C J   but it was comfortably above 30 in 2019  I ll give you that much  Yes we re    I think that we re very confident  We ve said that because of the growing installed base  the overall customer support business grows every year  How it grows each year I ve talked a little bit about the dynamic where depending on where you are in kind of utilization and spending and customers will spend on different things  I highlighted a very strong year for us in 2019 on productivity upgrades which is one of the things customers do when they re looking to squeeze a little bit more out of the assets they already have in their fabs and we saw a lot of that last year  I think that as you transition now to a very busy year and customers ramping aggressively  then you ll find yourself much more in these spares and some of the value added services part  But in general given the dynamics of that market and our product portfolio  we feel very confident about its ability to grow year on year with the installed base

Thank you  Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan 
Harlan Sur    JPMorgan    Analyst
Good job on the solid business execution  With the complexity of the manufacturing process combined with tighter specifications maybe longer install and call times  on average from the time that you ship a tool to the time that that tool is put into full volume production  I think greenfield is around six months  Is this lead time around the same time for conversion and incremental capacity expansion  And the reason why I ask is I just wanted to do a sanity check that for some of the memory shipment goodness that you re seeing  hopefully this is going to be layering on in sync with the demand pull from memory which is typically more kind of middle to kind of second half of the year weighted 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
I don t think we ve really broken it out  And in fact I don t know that I could even really speak to a material difference in lead times  I guess if I caught your question  it was    does a conversion have approximately the same lead time for the upgrade to take place and the product to be called  And if that was the question  I would say that they re not dramatically different in terms of the cycle time 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  And Harlan maybe I m guessing what your question might be  I mean when we look at the way spending occurred in the second half of 2019 in NAND  I ll remind you we ve been saying this for a while  We exited the year  we believe the industry supply growth 30  year on year  Based on the investments we saw occurring in the second half of 2019  we believe that rate will decline    supply growth will decline into the first half of 2020  right  And so you re starting to see an uptick in investment that will have a lag effect to it and it won t immediately be producing output  I think that s inherently what you re asking right 
Harlan Sur    JPMorgan    Analyst
Exactly  That s exactly right  And I appreciate the response  And actually as a follow on to that  So  you guys had anticipated NAND bit supply growth exiting 2019 around 30  below the demand rate  I think some of your customers in DRAM we re seeing bit supply kind of low to mid teens  again  below kind of the demand rate  So  given the improving fundamentals in memory this year  kind of  extrapolating from your customer equipment requirements this year  how do you guys see bit supply growth in NAND and DRAM this year from kind of the depressed levels exiting last year 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  So  you ve got it exactly right what we said  We exited the year well below the long term demand trend  And actually even with the guidance we ve just given  we actually see ourselves under growing long term demand this year in terms of bit supply growth both in NAND and in DRAM

Thank you  Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi 
Atif Malik    Citi    Analyst
Good job on results and guide  If I look at your top line growth historically you outperformed WFE by 2x or so  How should we think about your top line growth relative to WFE for this year 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
To the color I d give you is again  what I ve already said is I think it s an uptick in NAND investment  Our SAM on NAND is really strong  Our share in NAND is really strong  And so to the extent that NAND is driving an uptick in WFE  Lam will do really well  And you ve seen that over the years  in times when memory is spending more  we do real well and when it s going the other way  we do less well  You should expect the same thing  I m not going to quantify it for you whether history is a good indicator  I m not completely sure  But I ll be very disappointed if we don t outperform this year 
Atif Malik    Citi    Analyst
Very helpful Doug  And as a follow up the WFE number for this year is even bigger than what we were thinking  55 billion  Can you just talk about the opportunity in image sensor  advanced packaging things like that  And how big that number is in your WFE number for this year 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes we put that in a logic and other space  And what Tim indicated we expect foundry logic to grow 2019 to 2020  And I don t know the exact image sensor number so I can t answer your exact question  It s a secular grower for sure  But in the grand scheme of how big foundry and logic is  it s actually not all that big  But it is something we do really  really well in    in terms of the TSV aspect of image sensors 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  All I would add is of the reasons you ve heard us talk a lot more about specialty technologies and some of the products that we introduced in 2019 really focusing on energy integration and advanced packaging and MRAM and the image sensors is because many of those items are somewhat growing year by year from applications that are a little bit decoupled from the larger WFE cycle  And so again even last year as WFE was down we were setting records and what we kind of refer to as our specialty technologies business which is primarily served by the reliant tools  And so I think you can continue to see us focus in those areas because there are places where our technology plays very well  And as Doug said we can    by bringing the right technology and cost point we can really gain quite a large portion of that market

Thank you  Our next question will come from the Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities 
Vivek Arya    Bank of America Securities    Analyst
Congratulations on the strong and consistent execution  I have two questions as well  The first one  I m curious what goes into your WFE calculation just because it s such a strong outlook for this year  Is it orders  Is it capex  Is it memory pricing assumption  I m just curious what goes into it  And as part of that if you could also give us some color on how you think the shape of WFE looks like first half versus second half 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  I ll go through it and then I m sure Tim will have comments on that  I mean we go after this in a couple of different ways  We talk to customers first and foremost  Customers tell us here s our plan  Here s what we think we re going to do kind of customer by customer fab by sound  So that s the bottoms up approach to it  It doesn t mean it s exactly precisely correct  It changes customers  plans can change  but that s one aspect of how we come at it  The second aspect is actually a tops down approach which is we take a read on  Okay  what does global GP going to look like this year  What does that mean for electronics demand  What does that mean for IC unit and semi revenue growth  And what does that mean relative to wafers and technology  And then we try to correlate the two approaches together  We don t always get it perfect  but it s a pretty robust process and I think we do a decent job  but we don t always get it exactly right  but we do our best  I don t know  Tim anything 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  No  I think it stems as Doug said from pretty extensive conversations with customers  One of the nice things about this business is that we have developed very deep relationships with the customers and they re just as interested in having us deliver the technology they need on time  And so I think it s pretty open sharing about when tools are needed when the ramp is going to occur  So that factors quite a bit into the calculation 
Vivek Arya    Bank of America Securities    Analyst
And anything on first half versus second half 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  I think that it s going to be a little bit of a first half weighted year really driven by foundry and logic  I think memory spending is going to be pretty steady through the year  But I think Foundry is probably a little bit first half weighted 
Vivek Arya    Bank of America Securities    Analyst
Got it  And for my follow up your installed base has grown at a 10   11  annual base in the last five years which is pretty remarkable given the volatility in WFE  My question is how fast have your services have grown annually during those five years  And how should we think about the installed base and services growth for the next two to three years  Thank you 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  I ll give you a little color  I mean the best indicator of how it s growing is just chamber count because that really is what drives the business opportunity 
Having said that we re doing a lot of innovative things around advanced service offerings in different ways to deliver value to customers that drives our objective  Vivek  at the end of the day to have dollars grow faster than just the growth in chamber count  And if you come to see us in March we ll probably give you a little more color around what this business looks like 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  And I think the only thing I d add I made comments about the productivity upgrades and solutions part of that business  It s    obviously every customer is driving to reduce their running costs in their fabs  And so between upgrades for existing tools as well as new really data enabled services that we offer to help recover tools more quickly with less labor and with a higher probability of first time right  Those    that part of the business is actually growing very fast and I think has the ability just as it did this past year growing 30  year on year the ability to outgrow the installed base and so we re investing in that area

Thank you  Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company 
Krish Sankar    Cowen and Company    Analyst
Congrats guys on the great results  Just two quick ones either Tim or Doug  When you look at the calendar year 2020 and like you mentioned WFE is probably front half loaded mostly foundry  logic biased going toward memory in the back half  Are there any nuances in gross margin we should worry about  Or is there like one segment has a better gross margin profile than the other  And then I have a follow up 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No there s nothing specific to gross margin by segment that you should be thinking about  It varies with customer mix  It varies with product mix and then overall business volumes is what I think I ve said every single quarter that I ve been at the company it s the same language  So  there isn t anything specific by segment 
Krish Sankar    Cowen and Company    Analyst
Got it  Got it  Doug and then just a follow up on the opex  I understand March has the seasonality with all the merit increase etc  but how do we think about opex on a go forward basis  It s like 18  of sales a good bogey to use  Or is the  500 million plus run rate    quarterly run rate the right metric 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
If you look at what we ve done over the longer term  we ve let spending grow at a rate less than the top line has grown over the last    I don t know since we brought the two companies together  And I think you re going to see us thinking that same way as we see a stronger year in front of us  And again come see us in March I ll give you an updated financial model as well

All right  Thank you  Next we have a question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS
Timothy Arcuri    UBS    Analyst
Doug I had two  First of all  China has been running about 30  of revenue for the past three quarters  Should we expect it to be about 30  as a percent of revenue in March  And I assume within that  that it would still be like the vast majority of it would be the domestic guys  Is that correct 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  I m not going to get into kind of telling you quarter by quarter what it is  Let me remind you what I said earlier  I think it grows  2 billion to  3 billion off a base of 6 ish    a little above  6 billion for the year  It will be lumpy  Tim you know how this goes there s a project that takes tools and has to ramp it for a while and digest it and something else kicks in  I m not going to give you exact color on the March guide  but I think it will be a good year for local China this year

Okay  Great  Thanks Doug  And then I guess this is kind of a bigger picture question  but given what s going on with export control I mean you re saying that domestic China is going to add maybe  2 billion to  3 billion to 2020 WFE  Do you think that there s any of this incremental stuff going on within China where customers are concerned about maybe someday down the road they can t get access to tools  And so they re pulling in timelines of these fabs  Thanks 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  I guess I ll take that one Timothy  But I mean we ve answered this a couple of times that  we ve seen no indication that the China buys or pull ins  There appear to be solid plans behind what they re trying to do  And every tool we ship there they re trying to ramp as quickly as they can  So I really don t    I don t think that plays into it  Having said that  we are watching what s going on with the talk about regulatory controls  But at this point no details that we could even really comment on

Thank you  Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley 
Joe Moore    Morgan Stanley    Analyst
I wonder back to the topic of this China sovereign business  If you could give us some color on the number of customers and people tend to think about memory but just    I m not looking for specifics  but how much of it is memory versus other stuff and just an indication of the breadth that you re seeing 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  So Doug made a comment about the demand being pretty broad based  I mean we are seeing    and again you sort of think about what s great about our market right now is the breadth of driver    end market drivers  There s a lot of IoT and specialty technologies whether it be automotive power devices  it s image sensors  You kind of see all of that    people in China trying to address that in demand  And so it s not isolated to any one thing  Clearly the uptick in memory has outsized importance for land revenue  And obviously we watch very closely what happens especially in the NAND and DRAM areas  But really our outlook in the  2 billion to  3 billion increase that Doug talked about in 2020 pretty broad based across quite a number of customers 
Joe Moore    Morgan Stanley    Analyst
Okay  Great  And then you guys have talked about a kind of  14 million  70 billion five year WFE for NAND kind of keeping us on a historic supply growth trajectory  Is that still kind of the right ballpark  And we see it would seem to be quite a bit lower than that right now  Is that still kind of the right framework for thinking about what WFE ought to be if we stay in a historical demand context 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  That s still the way we let it  And our comment you just said we were quite a bit below that at this point  That was part of our commentary as I said through last year  we were actually under investing for long term demand  That long term demand is what establishes our  70 billion five year investment  And even this year as we see a strong uptick in NAND  we still as we said expect ourselves to exit the year maybe slightly maybe slightly still below the long term demand rate

Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel 
Patrick Ho    Stifel    Analyst
Congrats also  Maybe Doug first in terms of the installed base business and the growth you re seeing there and the sustainability of that growth  Can you just give a little bit of color of how you ve see maybe over the last few years and going forward how the business has kind of transitioned from I guess the transactional break and fixed type of business to more of the contract base which gives you a better visibility into the revenue and cash flow stream of that business 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  Patrick I m actually going to redirect it to Tim because I think he ll give you a more comprehensive answer than I one 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
Doug can certainly add something there  But I think we have seen that transition and it s not just something that s happened to us  It s been a strategy we ve been driving to try to make this business less transactional much more value add and also much more long term  And I talked to my script about one way in which we do that you transition the transactional to longer term through multi year contracts  Even there  you re able to help the customer control their cost in a much more predictable way  And that gives us better visibility going forward makes the business a little less transactional  But I think the biggest way that we ve transitioned this business from transactional to strategic is really through our focus on new products in the portfolio of services and upgrades that allow the customer to change the cost profile of running their installed base and so in that way you can make this much more strategic 
I talked about the Corvus R technology the self maintaining tool where the system itself replaces some of its consumable parts rather than having to have technicians go and do that work  When we engineer that type of new upgrade we then create for yourself an entire new SAM within your installed base  And now as customers recognize the value of that automated replacement system  they go and they upgrade all of those older tools that are in the installed base and it creates another source of ongoing revenue for us  And in the meantime we re looking for that next upgrade to engineer and offer to the customers  And so I think it s becoming much more of a product and strategic refocused business  It just happens that its targeted market is the installed base that we ve already shipped 
Patrick Ho    Stifel    Analyst
Great  that s helpful  And maybe as my follow up question and maybe for Tim since you talked about in your prepared remarks about the ALD market and the market expansion opportunity there  On top of the share gains you ve made in that segment  as well as the market growing particularly in the Foundry Logic space  do you see additional applications and foundry and logic driving this growth  Or is there an opportunity to expand to other segments like DRAM 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes it already is expanding into other markets  I mean the only difference being again with ALD you re essentially creating a deposition technology  a platform and that s one thing that Lam is very good at is  we re creating high productivity platforms  And then we expand the portfolio of films that we can deposit and that creates more application opportunities for us  So I talked about oxides and carbides there are other films that are also being developed at the same time  And I think that ultimately every device type reaches a point where it needs to do some level of atomic layer processing  And so long term  I think this is just where the technology is going  That s why you see ALD starting to replace as I said some older process alternatives for certain steps

Thank you  Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo 
Joe Quatrochi    Wells Fargo    Analyst
Congrats on the results  I was curious on the NAND flash side  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the amount of clean room space that you see across the industry today and that s empty  And then how do you think about just the industry s kind of views on filling it versus past cycles 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
Sorry you re still there  Sorry you broke off at the end  Okay  There s out there in the industry for sure across all of the customer base  And so what I always say is  in fact I think I don t know a quarter or two ago we talked about the fact that we were tracking double digit number of new fabs in 2019  I think the number is probably about the same in 2020  a lot of those being memory fabs  The thing to understand with our customers is building the shell is    it s a cheap call option on the future  right  It doesn t mean they re going to equip it tomorrow  but it does indicate to you a long term intention  And then they buy equipment when they really need the output  That s where the real money in capital gets deployed  But there s plenty of cleaner space out there 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  I guess the only thing I d add I thought perhaps you were going to ask about the importance of clean room space  And so that was going to be able to tell you  That s the    one of the things that we focus on you might have understood in the past roast commentary that a benefit of some of our products like this and why it s popular within the NAND market is  the number of wafers that we output from that tool per square meter of fab space that s consumed is actually the best in the industry  That s an important metric  Even when Doug says there s lots of fab space which I certainly agree with how they use it is always important to the customer  And so  again as we think through platform design and launching new tools what we call footprint density or throughput density is really one of the key metrics that we focus on 
Joe Quatrochi    Wells Fargo    Analyst
That s helpful  And then just back on the services side  Given that we should start to see    I would think an acceleration in the growth of your installed base this year with just a rebound in memory demand should    is it fair to us to think about accelerating year over year revenue growth for that business in 2020 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Joe the way I generally think about it is  the chambers shipping and then they monetize over a period of time after they ship  And so the fact that you saw chambers grow in 2019  that s a good indicator of of what s going to drive growth in 2020  That s how I generally think about it  There s a little bit of a lag to it after the chamber count which is why historically we ve given you a chamber count number one time a year at the end of the year

Thank you  Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG
Mehdi Hosseini    SIG    Analyst
All the good ones have already been asked  Just a quick follow up for Doug  How should we think about opex just roughly beyond the March quarter 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  I kind of answered that already  And I kind of didn t answer it in how I answered it  But what I said I ll give you a new financial model in March  And what I said is over the last several years  the same management team is here that s been around the company for a while  We like to see revenue grow faster than that we want to let spending growth  so that we deliver some leverage to the bottom line  That s still very much how we think about it 
Mehdi Hosseini    SIG    Analyst
But your March quarter shows typical seasonal uptick  And I know we do wait until March 3rd should I think of your opex remaining at the minimum at the same level is not going to just be a onetime event 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  that s probably not an unreasonable way to be thinking about it for now Mehdi

Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets 
Mitch Steves    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst
Hey guys  Thanks for taking the question  I think the majority have been answered  but I just want to clarify maybe two small things  So  number one is the comments on DRAM  so it sounds like that s going to be up year over year for 2020  I just want to make sure that s right and it wasn t anything to read between there  And then secondly I don t expect numbers from this  but is the message that you guys believe you re going to gain more share in NAND relative to the other markets in 2020 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I ll take the first one and then I ll let Tim comment on the share  I don t really see    when I look at the WFE  the color that we just gave you a real recovery in NAND  I wouldn t describe it that way    sorry in DRAM  in DRAM  Clearly  in NAND  yes  foundry and logic continues to be strong  DRAM is kind of a push plus or minus  And what we see happening is there s still a little bit of inventory out in the channel  It s got to get burned off  And at some point you can t continue to sustain supply growth below where demand growth is  And when we look at DRAM bit growth  we think supply growth in 2020 is below demand growth 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  And I think a little bit longer term and also relative to clearing the inventory  We ve been very encouraged by comments we ve heard about what we understand are drivers for DRAM  The growth in the server market  the introduction of 5G where you re seeing pretty substantial step up in terms of DRAM content per handset  And so it s and I think Doug said this in the past  but it s even for DRAM a little bit more matter of when not if  So  I think it s just    right now we have    as we said maybe about a push for the outlook that we have just given you  Your comment about NAND  I guess when we think about share or share of total spend  one of the things we ve talked about is a strength for us in NAND obviously is that we are    and our tools are key enablers of building taller and taller NAND stacks  And as those stacks increase  our share of total WFE continues to increase  And so given that year on year we continue to see a greater portion of spend being spent on taller NAND devices  our share of total spend will increase 
Mitch Steves    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst
Okay  That makes perfect sense  Just really small  if I could  What was just like the dollar impact to the virus that you guys are taking out of the Q1 just to get an idea 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I m not going to describe the specific dollars  It was an amount that we think is consistent with what we re hearing from customers and suppliers

Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham   Company 
Quinn Bolton    Needham and Company    Analyst
Hey  guys  Thanks for squeezing me in  One near term question  one longer term question on the near term question  Given the travel restrictions in China around the coronavirus outbreak  Can you guys say    are you guys having difficulty accessing some of the fabs either in the installed base business  Or delivering new tools  Or is it still somewhat business as usual and you have access to service the tools in the fab you re able to deliver tools here in the near term 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No  I think very specifically I think most people are aware the travel restrictions have been placed on travel in and out of Huan itself  And so obviously  we can t travel into that area where there are some customers located  But in general  I think that as Doug said  we re moving through the Lunar New Year  which now has been extended and got of abundance of caution Lam has also implemented travel restrictions for our people to kind of business critical situations only and I think from the standpoint of the impact and the way we ve looked at it is there could be delays of a few weeks in our    in supply chain or shipments to customers  And we don t see that  as any real change thought the demand picture that we ve outlined  And therefore  we re really talking about just hopefully seeing this normalize over the next few weeks 
Quinn Bolton    Needham and Company    Analyst
Great  That s helpful color  And then the longer term question is that your 2020 WFE forecast  I think is higher than probably what many of us were thinking  I guess as I look out to 2021  It sounds like DRAM is not part of the 2020 forecast  Do you think 2021 WFE can continue to trend higher if that DRAM spending comes back 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
You know we re not going to add to that  I don t know what 2021 is  Listen  when I think about it the long term growth drivers are totally intact  We have been talking about this for years  right  You got data exploding in society  You got cloud and hyperscale  the big seven what have you investing in more in equipment this year  That s good  You ve got 5G on the come line that s good  You ve got density growing there in every phone  So the long term is really very positive for the industry and our position in the industry enabling it  We feel really good about where we re sitting

Okay  Our last question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank 
Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank    Analyst
Great  Thanks a lot for squeezing me in  My first question is on the memory spending this year  If things play out the way you think  are you thinking that NAND capex will still be below that  70 billion run rate  I know you said you waited below 40  bit supply growth  I guess  in the way I m trying to parse out that  8 billion to  10 billion increase in WFE you guys forecasting 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  Sidney  we never give you segment by segment WFE numbers and I m not going to now  It is going to grow this year  And as Tim  described we think bit growth in NAND is    in the first half anyway below where long term demand is and probably exiting the year is getting closer to being in balance  But we still think it s below where demand growth is  I m going to leave it at that 
Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank    Analyst
Okay  How about DRAM bit supply growth exiting the year if there is to your point  if there s a DRAM capex being a push 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
DRAM bit growth also I think as you said would under grow long term demand this year 
Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank    Analyst
Okay  Maybe a longer term question  With the share gains you had in foundry and logic this year  and I think it was as high as 48  of the total revenue last quarter  How should we think about your exposure between foundry and logic and memory through the next cycle I think versus maybe last five years remember was averaging like close to 70  sales 
Doug Bettinger    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
We ve got nice trajectory relative to what s going on in foundry and logic  We had a really strong December quarter record level in foundry  I expect our share of WFE in both foundry and logic continue to be very strong  I m not going to pinpoint exactly what it is versus memory because we were very strong in memory as well  I feel really good about where we re positioned  I ll just put it that way 
Tim Archer    President and Chief Executive Officer
I mean I think the simplest way to think about it as a company  our objective is to improve our share    revenue share of WFE across all segments

144012,365527,LRCX,Lam Research Roars to New Heights on Improving WFE Industry Conditions,news,"Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  released fiscal second quarter 2020 results late Wednesday  marking a return to top line growth for the semiconductor processing solutions company that was much more pronounced than its previous guidance  which was provided in October  indicated 
Shares are up more than 4  as the market absorbs the news  setting a new all time high in the process  Let s dig in for a better idea of what Lam accomplished over the past few months  as well as what we should be watching for the rest of the year 

Data source  Lam Research   For the quarter ended Dec  29  2019  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles  

 An improving wafer fabrication equipment environment    
Adjusted for one time items like acquisition and restructuring expenses  Lam s non GAAP net income was  602 million  or  4 01 per share  up from  3 87 per share in the same year ago period  Adjusted gross margin also arrived at 45 7   Of note here  That bottom line was notably bolstered by Lam moving to repurchase  1 billion of common shares during the quarter  
Still  these results compared favorably to Lam s latest guidance  which called for revenue of  2 35 billion to  2 65 billion  adjusted gross margin of 44  to 46   and adjusted net income per share of  3 60 to  3 80 
Meanwhile  Lam generated operating cash flow of  307 9 million  ending the quarter with  4 9 billion in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  Deferred revenue also declined to  411 million from  481 million last quarter  while its deferred profit fell to  366 million from  407 million three months ago  
On a geographic basis  Lam generated 29  of total revenue from China  up from 27  last quarter   26  from Taiwan  up from 18  last quarter   18  from Korea  down from 21  three months ago   9  from the U S   up from 8  before   8  in Japan  down from 13    7  from Southeast Asia  down from 7  previously   and Europe was steady at roughly 3  of total sales 
 Lam closed out calendar 2019 with strong December quarter results   stated Lam Research President and CEO Tim Archer   We are executing at a high level in an improving wafer fabrication equipment environment and building a powerful pipeline of new products to fuel future growth  
Looking forward
For the current quarter  ending March 29  2020   Lam Research expects revenue of  2 6 billion to  3 billion  adjusted gross margin of 45 5  to 47 5   and adjusted net income per share of  4 15 to  4 95  Here again  most analysts were modeling lower fiscal third quarter earnings of  4 per share on revenue near the bottom end of Lam s target range 
All told  there was little not to like about Lam s steady results amid modestly improved WFE industry conditions  And even with shares trading near their all time highs leading into this report  it was no surprise to see this top tech stock continuing to surge in response on Thursday ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppgr0,2073013

144014,365529,LRCX,Lam Research  LRCX  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Lam Research  LRCX   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 9 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  326 82 in the previous session  Lam Research has gained 11 3  since the start of the year compared to the 6 2  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 3 6  return for the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on January 29  2020  Lam Research reported EPS of  4 01 versus consensus estimate of  3 81 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 22  
For the current fiscal year  Lam Research is expected to post earnings of  16 82 per share on  10 53 billion in revenues  This represents a 15 6  change in EPS on a 9 07  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  20 12 per share on  11 86 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 19 58  and 12 61   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Lam Research may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Lam Research has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 19 3X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 18 5X versus its peer group s average of 18 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 1  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Lam Research currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Lam Research passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Lam Research shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Lam Research Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Lam Research have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including Photronics  PLAB   Entegris  ENTG   and Lumentum Holdings  LITE   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 6  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Lam Research  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2020-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lam-research-lrcx-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200504880,200504880

average Those occurrences are rare and typically turn into a meaningful pullback  So I advised my followers to take some profits and get a little more defensive a couple of weeks ago I said that while stocks like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Intel  NASDAQ INTC  and Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  could keep climbing to new highs    and the upper realms of their valuation trading ranges    we should be on the look out for a 3 6  drop soon where we would be big buyers of all kinds of stocks  but especially Technology and Healthcare  All we needed was a catalyst And then along came the coronavirus  or 2019 nCoV to be precise  the seventh variety of crown fringed  spherical influenza virus named for its visual symmetry with the solar corona What If It Goes Pandemic  The last great pandemic was during WWI when the Spanish flu infected 500 million people globally and killed at least 50 million  Thus far  this coronavirus outbreak which began in the Wuhan province of central China has only challenged the 2002 03 SARS  severe acute respiratory syndrome  virus which infected about 5 500 and killed 800 As of Tuesday  2019 nCoV  the  n  is for novel  had made nearly 21 000 people sick and killed over 425  with the majority of cases still in China  only a dozen or so in the US  and less than 20 in Europe It s spreading quickly because it s a respiratory infection that takes 2 to 14 days to incubate and during that window can be transmitted from one person to another even when flu symptoms are not apparent  It shouldn t surprise anyone who understands the exponential growth curves of an epidemic virus to see total infections cross 50 000 this month And since coronaviruses originate in animals  from pigs to bats  it takes time to develop a new vaccine when a new strain mutates and transmits to human host cells But for comparison s sake  it s helpful to understand that seasonal flu can cause over 25 million outpatient visits and more than 200 000 hospitalizations each year  During the severe 2017 2018 flu season  one of the longest in recent years  estimates indicate that more than 900 000 people were hospitalized and more than 80 000 people died from flu So while the WHO has declared a global health emergency and has warned about the potential for a pandemic  it would take a lot more traction to come close to a typical flu season where 20K to 40K might die  depending on severity  What About China s Slowing Economy  For investors  one of the other fronts we re watching is what impact this health emergency has on China s already slowing economy  Shutting down factories  transportation and shopping districts for even a few weeks will put a big dent in this quarter s GDP and could have rippling effects throughout Asia On Monday February 3  the Chinese stock market re opened after their New Year holiday and fell almost 9  as it absorbed the previous 10 days of coronavirus news and business impacts But the Chinese financial authorities were also ready with stimulus measures from their central bank to make sure ample liquidity was available and to shore up confidence US markets barely flinched  even opening higher than last Friday s big sell off lows  Stoking more confidence is word that Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  has an experimental stage antiviral drug which was originally targeted to treat SARS and Ebola  Gilead s remdesivir seems to have worked on the one patient in Seattle and now  according to Bloomberg News  will be tested by a medical team from Beijing based China Japan Friendship Hospital for efficacy in treating the deadly new strain of coronavirus Continue reading                                                                                                            Research indicates the booming biotech sector is poised to deliver some of the strongest returns you ll find anywhere in the stock market  Breaking news in this space frequently creates quick double  and triple digit profit opportunities for investors These companies are changing the world   and owning their stocks could transform your portfolio  Recent trades from this sector have generated  43    83  and  164  gains in as little as 9 days                                                                                                     Okay  Time to Buy the Dip Now It sounds like I ve laid out a pretty good case for not worrying too much about the coronavirus  And as of Friday  we got our 3 6  pullback in the S P 500 as well as a 3 3  hiccup in the Nasdaq 100 Then Tuesday brought a big pop in the Nasdaq to new all time highs on the back of a surge in Microsoft shares  This move prompted me to make a couple of juicy stock buys I d been waiting for while their shares were still on sale But there is still a big unknown lurking in the data from China  According to The Lancet  coronavirus forecasting models indicate there could be as many as 200 000 infections that are not yet revealed by symptoms  confirmed medically  and reported to authorities  This projection is based on the current transmission rates and doubling of infections every 5 6 days This sets up a potential surprise for investors when all of a sudden more data is available and the true size of infections is known  Imagine the day when we learn that there are over 100 000 people infected  Is the market ready for that surprise While this conjecture about unknowns could turn out to be wrong  I always insist on thinking in probabilities  Right now  the odds favor this pandemic getting far worse before it gets better and I don t think the market is ready for that My Plan  Make a Shopping List Whether or not we get another 5  down leg in the market  I m getting ready to buy my favorite Technology and Healthcare stocks  looking for new highs in Q1 and into Q2  Some of these companies play in both realms  like Gilead the Biotechnology stock How do I get ready  With a shopping list  I already know which stocks I want to buy and in what price range I m ready to place my order  And my plan isn t built around one magical day when I call the bottom  I start scaling into some positions early and gradually  especially the ones I think will bounce hardest and first Again  I m not calling for a big double digit correction in February  But when the S P index pulls back 5  after a strong run  it means lots of midcap and smallcap stocks will be down 20 40   And that s a very attractive opportunity for an investor trader like me Have you started building your shopping list yet  If not  now is a great time to get started  How to Capitalize on 2020 s Most Exciting Opportunities As mentioned above  I m keeping a close eye on the Technology and Healthcare sectors  And Biotech   where these sectors overlap   could be the fastest way to grow your wealth in 2020 and beyond I just updated my special report called The Century of Biology  7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Now to help you profit from the booming world of Biotech  You re

144018,365533,LRCX,Applied Materials  AMAT  Preview  Buy The Semiconductor Stock Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Applied Materials   NASDAQ AMAT   has topped quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing four periods to help the stock jump 55  in the last 12 months  Now  let s dive into why investors might want to buy the semiconductor equipment firm heading into its Q1 fiscal 2020 earnings release on Wednesday  February 12 
Industry Overview 
The semiconductor industry is historically cyclical  and last year was rough as companies saw their earnings and revenues fall against hard to compare periods  Despite the top and bottom line declines  many chip stocks surged in 2019 after a 2018 selloff devalued the firms that will continue to help fuel the technology market for years to come from Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   to Microsoft   OTC MFST   
Semiconductor stocks also climbed in 2019 because companies were set to report growth in 2020 after a down year  And some early 2020 results do indeed show that the chip market looks poised for a comeback  Industry heavyweights Samsung   OTC SSNLF    Intel   NASDAQ INTC    and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co    NYSE TSM   have already posted solid quarterly results this year and raised their outlooks 
AMAT s Pitch 
Applied Materials is a leading semiconductor equipment company  Its offerings help produce new chips and advanced displays  AMAT executives expect to benefit from the continued expansion of the big data age and see the emergence of Artificial Intelligence and other new computing tech as key longer term growth drivers   
Applied Materials is also focused on figuring out what s next as classic Moore s law scaling slows  This is why the firm has focused on what it calls the new playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing  which includes five main elements   New architectures  new devices and 3D structures  new materials  new ways to shrink the feature geometries  and new ways to connect chips together  
In the fourth quarter  management upped their Q1 2020 guidance  citing growth in key areas such as foundry logic  The Santa Clara  California based company also pointed to innovations within data centers  growing cloud computing demand and the roll out of 5G   While we are carefully managing all non R D spending  we re investing more than ever in new capabilities and products to accelerate the new playbook   CEO Gary Dickerson said on AMAT s Q4 earnings call 
 
 
 
 
Other Fundamentals
The nearby chart shows that AMAT stock has gone on a solid run over the last five years and recovered from its 2018 downturn  Applied Materials shares have soared 115  since the end of December 2018  to outpace the likes of Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   and Micron   NASDAQ MU    AMAT stock has been a little up and down in the past three months  but it is up 11  during this stretch and sits just off its 52 week highs as of Friday morning 
Meanwhile  AMAT is trading at a discount compared to the Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication average  as it has for the past five years  AMAT is currently trading at 16 1X forward earnings  This comes in well below its industry s 23 1X average  rival Lam Research s   NASDAQ LRCX   17 7X  and its 12 month high of 18 6X 
On top of that  AMAT s industry ranks No  5 out of our 255 Zacks industries at the moment  The company also returned roughly  3 2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2019  AMAT s dividend yield sits at 1 33   which is not too far off LRCX s 1 41  and the 10 year U S  Treasury s 1 59  
 
 
 
 
Outlook 
Our current Zacks estimates project AMAT s adjusted Q1 2020 earnings will jump 13 6  to  0 92 per share on 9 8  higher revenue 
Applied Materials full year 2020 sales are expected to surge 15  to  16 79 billion  This would represent a strong comeback after 2019 s decline and come in just above 2018 s top line figure  Peeking further ahead  AMAT s fiscal 2021 sales are projected to jump another 9 9  higher to  18 45 billion 
At the bottom end of the income statement  Applied Materials adjusted earnings are projected to pop 25 3  in 2020  with 2021 expected to come in another 17 5  stronger 
Bottom Line
Applied Materials has also seen its earnings estimate revisions climb since it posted its Q4 results  with its Q1 consensus up from  0 72 to its current  0 92 a share  Plus  its fiscal 2020 EPS estimate popped from  3 29 to  3 81 and 2020 jumped from  3 91 to  4 47 
The earnings estimate positivity helps Applied Materials hold a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   And the stock appears to be worth considering ahead of earnings as part of a larger semiconductor industry comeback this year and beyond

Lam Research currently earns a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and holds an overall  B  VGM score  LRCX is also part of an industry that rests in the top 5  of our more than 250 Zacks industries  LRCX s strong Value score is supported by the fact that it consistently trades at a discount compared to its industry  Meanwhile  its dividend yield of 1 41  comes in not too far below the 10 year U S  Treasury note s 1 6

144069,365584,LRCX,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Lam Research  LRCX ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Lam Research  LRCX   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Lam Research currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if LRCX is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this semiconductor equipment maker holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For LRCX  shares are up 4 03  over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry is up 3 71  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 17 56  compares favorably with the industry s 17 81  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Lam Research have risen 34 85   and are up 89 68  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 7 61  and 19 88   respectively 
Investors should also take note of LRCX s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  LRCX is averaging 1 787 250 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with LRCX 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost LRCX s consensus estimate  increasing from  13 60 to  15 04 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that LRCX is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Lam Research on your short list ",2019-11-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-lam-research-lrcx-200487011,200487011

144108,365623,LRCX,Analysts Estimate Lam Research  LRCX  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Lam Research  LRCX  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This semiconductor equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  36  
Revenues are expected to be  2 35 billion  down 24 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lam Research 
For Lam Research  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lam Research will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lam Research would post earnings of  3 38 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 70  delivering a surprise of  9 47  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lam Research doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-lam-research-lrcx-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200443986,200443986

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Lam Research currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 91   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-06-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-lam-research-lrcx-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200436161,200436161
144178,365693,LRCX,Earnings Preview  Lam Research  LRCX  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Lam Research  LRCX  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This semiconductor equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 38 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  29 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 40 billion  down 16 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lam Research 
For Lam Research  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lam Research will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lam Research would post earnings of  3 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 87  delivering a surprise of  5 45  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lam Research doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-lam-research-lrcx-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200407741,200407741

What s Next for Lam Research 
While Lam Research has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Lam Research was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 28 on  2 32 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  13 89 on  9 57 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

Last Week Recap
In my  I interrupted my mini vacation to review the recent developments  I noted that the average investor  who didn t take Econ 101 or doesn t remember it  was getting a real time lesson in economics  That captured the week s stories as well as anything  We are gradually seeing evidence of impulsive policies 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart  This week I am featuring   She includes a lot of relevant information in a single picture   worth more than a thousand words  Read the full post for more great charts and background analysis 

Stocks declined 0 22  with plenty of daily movement  The trading range was 2 1   calmer than in recent weeks  You can see the volatility results and comparisons in our indicator snapshot  below  
To put the post Christmas period in perspective  let s look at a longer term chart from Jill 

Whether the trend seems bullish or bearish depends mostly upon your time frame  A key question is what has changed in the last month 
Noteworthy
The U S  Energy Information Administration has published its   featuring some projections to 2050  The forecasts make and describe certain key assumptions  This is great reading for anyone interested in energy trends  Here are the key takeaways from the report 

  The United States becomes a net energy exporter in 2020 and remains so throughout the projection period as a result of large increases in crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas plant liquids  NGPL  production coupled with slow growth in U S  energy consumption 


  Of the fossil fuels  natural gas and NGPLs have the highest production growth  and NGPLs account for almost one third of cumulative U S  liquids production during the projection period 


  Natural gas prices remain comparatively low during the projection period compared with historical prices  leading to increased use of this fuel across end use sectors and increased liquefied natural gas exports 


  The power sector experiences a notable shift in fuels used to generate electricity  driven in part by historically low natural gas prices  Increased natural gas fired electricity generation  larger shares of intermittent renewables  and additional retirements of less economic existing coal and nuclear plants occur during the projection period 


  Increasing energy efficiency across end use sectors keeps U S  energy consumption relatively flat  even as the U S  economy continues to expand 

There are plenty of interesting charts  Here is a sample 

The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
 high frequency indicators are an important part of our regular research  This week s update shows a continuing decline in the short leaning indicators  which remain negative  The long leading forecast continues its recent rebound 
Earnings
We must take note of the earnings results for the week  but I won t call them either good or bad  The beat rate was good  but the size of the earnings beats  3   was below the five year average  Revenue beats were also below that measure     

So far  the earnings reports seem consistent with the economic data   growing  but at a slower pace 
When relevant  I include expectations  E  and the prior reading  P  
The Good
The shutdown ends at least for now  The myriad personal and economic effects will end 
Initial jobless claims declined to 199K   that this is the lowest level since 1969   Jeff   investors should realize that this will not continue forever  Slightly higher levels do not presage an imminent disaster  

The Bad
Leading economic indicators declined 0 1  in line with expectations  but down from November s gain of 0 2   Some of the elements were estimated because of the shutdown 
Existing home sales for December were at a 4 99 M annual rate  missing expectations of 5 25M and a prior of 5 33M   that single family housing starts are the most important housing series for the economy  The government shutdown delayed that data  Bill sees existing home sales as  reasonable  
The Chemical activity barometer  measured via a three month moving average  declined 0 3  in January  While this is still an increase of 0 8  year over year  it is a sharp decline from the last few months   sees this as a leading indicator for industrial production  as shown by the chart below 

The Ugly
This week s  ugly  news was going to include more stories about stressed government employees  including those plagued by predatory payday lenders  400   Really    and   We ll take the good news at face value for now  and I am delighted to change course  This was another real time lesson for the average citizen  Many of us don t think much about just what we expect from government and how many people are employed doing it 
Trying to distinguish essential from non essential is nearly impossible at the margin  Requiring people to work without pay is not acceptable 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
The calendar is the biggest of the new year  We have key reports on income and spending  consumer confidence  and the PCE index  January s employment report and the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  private employment release will be the most important 
That is enough for any normal week but wait  There s more  The FOMC s rate decision on Monday will include a press conference  While no change is expected everyone will be watching closely for confirmation of a kinder and gentler Fed 
And by the way  it is the biggest week of the earnings season 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
There is so much information of various types that next week defies a specific theme  It is both more useful and more educational to consider two  of many  elements of successful investment analysis 
A strong and proven analytical technique 
Interpreting data   especially what is important and what is not 
If you use these principles as a framework  next week will provide a great test 
What is your investing acumen

I confess to frustration and a touch of anger  Where has he been for the last month  Like a typical individual investor  he seemed to trail market developments  claiming that stock behavior implied an economic collapse  The financial punditry has emphasized the  message  from stock weakness  The   with a reprise of his famous rant  insisting that he had special information about the problems faced by many companies  The decline in stocks became  evidence  that the economic and earnings data did not tell the entire story  In the Q3 earnings season  stocks missing expectations declined significantly  Those beating expectations had only modest gains 

The idea of an objective look  considering both economic data and actual earnings reports  is something that a good investor  like regular readers of A Dash  has been doing for weeks 
But it is never too late to get back on the right track  Let s take a look at the analytical methods and data for the week ahead 
Compare this to the more sophisticated analysis from Brett Steenbarger    Among a list of great points  he notes the difficulty in using technical indicators when the political decisions can be game changers  He also emphasizes the herd behavior of investors 
Michael Gayed    takes a different look at the market message  including the accompanying news narrative  He explicitly considers the recession implied by market stories  Read the whole post and look at the chart  but here is the key point 

But remember that narrative tends to follow price   If equity markets are strong  it must mean we are in an expansion to most participants   If weak  the opposite   Price can be wrong  which makes any narrative that follows it wrong too 

And finally  the media treatment of news continues the emphasis on worries  The Davos reports featured asking prominent people  who have no expertise in recession forecasting  what they think  The Goldman CEO said his team saw 50  by the end of 2020  but it was possible that the economy would keep on chugging  What do you suppose was the headline  Stories about growth slowing in China gave no background  nor the resulting GDP growth level  north of 6   
Even the WSJ s Sober Look column  one of my regular reads  seems to be seeing something bad every day 

Let s turn to the major analytical methods and key data 

Methods
The message of the market  A decline in stocks is supposed to be the best read on the state of the economy  It does not depend on any government data and is never revised  Commodities are seen as key indicators 
Corporate earnings   with some emphasis on  quality  earnings   organic  growth  revenue growth  and no financial engineering 
All Fed  all the time  The many who missed the last ten years of the market rally blame the Fed  Everything is interpreted through the prism of Fed policy 
The list of geopolitical concerns   China  Brexit  Iran  N  Korea  There is never a dull moment 
The domestic worries   tomorrow s tweet  the shutdown  extreme partisanship  investigations  and a new surprise every week 
Economic data  Revised as more information is available  making it more accurate  eventually   Open to competing interpretations  Thought to be biased by some 

We ll see data of all sorts next week  It will be interesting to see if some of the methods align 

I ll add my own conclusions  in today s Final Thought

Best of the Week
If I had to recommend a single  must read article for this week  it would be  of the opportunities presented by the recent market decline  As usual  Chuck provides a lesson in how to approach the market  how to pick stocks  and how to use his valuable research tools  Remember the commercials urging you   don t leave home without it  with reference to a particular credit card  I find myself thinking about it when I read a post from Chuck  Don t buy a stock without it is a good way to describe the value of FAST Graphs 
This is the first installment of a planned series  The resulting ideas are screened for both value and debt levels  This process identified six candidate from 366 in the Commercial Services subsector  I recommend planning some time each week to follow these ideas 
And ideas they are  Chuck properly warns as follows 

I would also like to remind you that what I am presenting here are attractively valued research candidates  However  as this series of articles unfolds  you will discover that they come in all sizes  shapes and flavors  Consequently  even though they all may be fairly valued  that doesn t simultaneously suggest that they are suitable for every investor 

Stock Ideas
 in light of the Iran sanctions and the Trump Administration s changing policies  One of the few people commenting on oil who considers both supply and demand  Kirk s data based approach identifies the factors behind higher prices and the stocks that will benefit 
Intel   thinks it is a bargain 
Climate change  If you are not worried  move on to the next paragraph  If you are  read the Barron s cover story to find the companies most exposed to this threat 

Personal Finance
Seeking Alpha Senior Editor Gil Weinreich s  is consistently both interesting and informative  Each week he highlights stories of interest for both advisors and investors  This week I especially appreciated his   It is an apt focus for the week ahead as well as recent events 
Abnormal Returns is an important daily source for all of us following investment news  I read it religiously  His  this week emphasized the value of preparation   the upfront work that will help in much of your common activities  He features   who begins with this quotation 

 Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe     Abraham Lincoln

As always  there were many good links  but I especially liked  data based discussion of the difference between wealth and income 
Watch out for 
More scams   especially aimed at the elderly  Your grandson is not in jail in Miami  The IRS does not need payment from you via Home Depot  NYSE HD  gift cards  In fact  the IRS does not reach out via telephone  The people at the door are not going to enable you to get a free roof via your insurance 
Don t let them in the house  And don t send money in any form  Phone a friend if you are unsure 
Final Thought
For anyone investing over the last month  the dispassionate economic approach has been best  Here is my take on each 
The market message may be important for traders  but not for investors  Investors should know what their stocks are worth  Selling them because the emotional  Mr  Market  is selling condemns you to a path of chasing   buying high and selling low 
Corporate earnings are the fundamental valuation method for stocks  as long as one considers interest rates  Stick to the numbers rather than someone s slip of the lip or an analyst report 
The Fed is important at certain times  but the omnipotence is vastly over rated  Explaining everything by looking to the Fed means that  lacking a strong method  you are grabbing a popular one 
Geopolitical concerns are always with us  The problems are easy to list  Solutions are more difficult to imagine or to understand in the aftermath  Few really expect a US China trade agreement  so it will be huge when it happens 
Domestic political news  This may be the most dangerous  Everything is made into conflict and a crisis  A key question is whether the news is really relevant to financial markets or just  filler  for a slow day  Do not expect to see complete and comprehensive solutions  Compromise and negotiations take time  If you wait until it is over  you have waited too long 
Economic data provides the most objective information  but you need to know what is important  Especially  you should emphasize risk 
This list is not that difficult  It is mostly about what not to do  If you understand that the economy is  chugging along  at a reasonable pace with no recession on the horizon  you are most of the way there  Next  look for economically sensitive stocks that have been thrown under the bus by analysts playing amateur economist 
And finally   Do not depend on FAANG or other winners from last year 
Investors who are thinking ahead should be prepared for a change in market leadership 
 If you are confused by all of the noise and having trouble finding winners  you might want to request some of my papers for individual investors  Ask for my recent  client only  paper on Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   This company and many others will do just fine if the economy is merely reasonable  We can also generate extra income from stodgy stocks  Just send an email to main at newarc dot com 
I m more worried about 
Delays in planned business investments  We are a long way from  talking ourselves into recession   but it is an economic drag 
Brexit  There is little progress  The effects will involve another real time experiment 
I m less worried about

There were no surprises from the ECB on Thursday  as the central bank maintained policy as well as guidance for  rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019   With the ECB finally winding up its massive stimulus scheme  market focus has shifted to the timing of a rate hike  However  with the eurozone economy showing signs of weakness  we re unlikely to see a rate hike before the fourth quarter  at the earliest  The ECB remains cautious  and said that risks  have moved to the downside   This dovish stance indicates that the euro will not be receiving any support from the bank  and will have to rely on stronger data in order to attract investors

144263,365778,LRCX,Earnings Preview  Lam Research  LRCX  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This semiconductor equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 67 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 50 billion  down 3 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 2  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lam Research 
For Lam Research  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lam Research will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lam Research would post earnings of  3 21 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 36  delivering a surprise of  4 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lam Research doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-lam-research-lrcx-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200376220,200376220

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5 45   A quarter ago  it was expected that this semiconductor equipment maker would post earnings of  3 21 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 36  delivering a surprise of 4 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Lam Research  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry  posted revenues of  2 52 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 86   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 58 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Lam Research shares have added about 2 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5  
What s Next for Lam Research 
While Lam Research has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Lam Research was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 41 on  2 45 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  13 97 on  9 83 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

144326,365841,LRCX,A Bull In A China Shop  Semiconductor Stocks,opinion,"Following is the opening segment of this week s edition of Notes From the Rabbit Hole  NFTRH 504  For months now we have been tracking a divergence in the key cyclical Semiconductor Equipment segment  I am short AMAT   LRCX  to the broader Semi sector  ref  the most recent article from May 18 here  and this week we put more context to the divergence 
In light of the developing trade war between the US and China  let s review the all important Semiconductor sector and in particular  the Semi Equipment segment  which is a key economic early bird  and canary in a coal mine  
Various sectors took hits on Friday as Trump moved forward with Tariffs on China  But most of those sectors and industries are follow on aspects of the economic cycle  which got its start when the early bird chirped in early 2013 
With China in Trump s crosshairs and China a very key player in Semi Fab Equipment  there is a fundamental reason that the Equipment companies are faltering  From SEMI by way of a post at nftrh com in March 

SEMI predicts Samsung  KS 005930  will lead the pack in fab equipment spending in both 2018 and 2019  even though it will invest less each year than in 2017  By contrast  China will dramatically increase its year over year  YOY  fab equipment spending for the next two years   by 57 percent in 2018 and 60 percent in 2019   to support fab projects from both overseas and domestic companies  The China spending surge will thrust it past Korea as the top spending region in 2019 

The rate of Semi Fab spending growth was easing and a heavy reliance was being put on China to pick up the slack  Here is a screenshot from that post 

With the delicate balance of the Semi industry s global supply chain you might conjure an image of Trump s head  stitched to the body of a bull and set loose in a China shop  Okay  I ll play to the cheap seats for a laugh  source  capitaladvisorsltd com  
But SEMI s concerns about this blunt force known as Trump are real  and serious 

More than 100 lines of the proposed tariff list directly impact the semiconductor supply chain  hitting fundamental components of the semiconductor manufacturing process  SEMI has fought back  strongly urging the removal of these tariff lines from the proposed tariff list  At a bare minimum  the tariffs against China will cost the U S  tens of millions annually in additional taxes  create lost revenue as a result of reduced exports  threaten thousands of high paying U S  jobs  stifle innovation and curb U S  technological leadership   all while not directly addressing U S  concerns with China 

I don t want to pretend to be able to quantify what the gross effects will be across various industries  including the Semis  The bull is rampaging and glass is breaking everywhere  I often talk about how we should tune out inflammatory headlines  but as noted in last week s updates  this trade stuff is real and it is fundamental  And SEMI is alarmed 
The general problem as I see it is that the bull is playing to a 1970s script  Back then the Semiconductor industry and all the technology it has enabled was just a glimmer in the eye of a few forward looking engineers  As a kid in the 70s and as a manufacturing guy in the 80s  and beyond  I remember what US industry was like when it was fully industrial  I remember how strong and important our raw materials industries were  I am from the industrial world where families could make a good living and small towns thrived with the presence of solid industrial and or materials corporations 
But that is over by and large  After Anthony Bourdain s death I binged a bunch of Parts Unknown episodes  including one in Appalachia  coal country  It is home to some of the hardest working  most welcoming people on the planet  It had been passed by  as we all know  Trumponomics has resuscitated coal and other pockets of industry but now let s picture what Semiconductors are and what they mean to the US and global economies  For better or worse  and I think there is a level of  worse  in the equation  we are fully digitized  electrified and connected through myriad systems and devices 
Semiconductors are in virtually everything vital to today s information networks and the  internet of things  operating in cars  homes and a million places in between  Pervasive is not a strong enough word when trying to quantify how important the Semi industry is to modern every day life  I am not trying to be cruel or dismissive of people whom time has passed by  I am simply trying to convey that Trump   through his old fashioned scope of view   threatens to impair the 90  to a degree  while bailing out the 10  
The time for Trump was in the 1980s into the 90s  before the die had been cast on the interconnected global economy and before the Fed   the true culprit in the division between rich and poor   had inflicted the bulk of its damage on society 
See this Business Insider article for the full and staggering lists of items to be hit by tariffs  There is much heavy industry and some items that require Semiconductors 
But the question is how will China react  With reference to the Semi Equipment Fab data noted above  and with Semi Equipment s status of economic bellwether  I d say we have ample reason why the  daily   weekly  charts below are doing what they are doing 
Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  Vs  VanEck Vectors Semiconductor  NYSE SMH 

Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX 

Now the question is whether or not the fundamentals being broken by the bull in the China shop will spread out to the rest of the economy just as the positive fundamental cycle that began in early 2013 did  Again  I am usually the one asking us to tune out the big  alarming stuff in the news  But Trump China is fundamental and the bull is playing to a 1970s script  It is a recipe for disaster if the bull keeps charging ",2018-06-18,Gary Tanashian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-bull-in-a-china-shop-semiconductor-stocks-200325873,200325873

CLPS Inc  NASDAQ CLPS  is a new issue  It rocketed from 5 00 to almost 18 00  more than tripling in a week  and then rested for three days in a falling wedge  On Tuesday  it looked like it popped out  up 1 85  or 16   to 13 52  on 655 764 shares traded  Targets are 15 and 17  and beyond that something in the 20 22 range is possible  Keep close tabs on 11 00  because under 11 00 we re stopping it 
Invuity Inc  NASDAQ IVTY  broke out of a wedge on Tuesday and popped 50 cents  or 14   to 4 00  on 544 747 shares traded  There is some resistance  but my next target has to be 4 3 4  If it gets through that  the secondary target and resistance are at 5 3 4 
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ SPPI   on positive drug news  may have broken out of a big wedge on Tuesday  with a breakaway gap  on 6 4 million shares  up 2 77  or 14 1 2   to 21 75  I like the way it looks  At this point  look for a test of 23  If it gets through 23  it has a good shot at getting to 29

144340,365855,LRCX,Is Lam Research  LRCX  Stock Outpacing Its Computer And Technology Peers This Year ,opinion,"The Computer and Technology group has plenty of great stocks  but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers  Has Lam Research  LRCX  been one of those stocks this year  A quick glance at the company s year to date performance in comparison to the rest of the Computer and Technology sector should help us answer this question 
Lam Research is one of 632 individual stocks in the Computer and Technology sector  Collectively  these companies sit at  7 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups  measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group 
The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks  This system has a long record of success  and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months  LRCX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  
Within the past quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for LRCX s full year earnings has moved 4 80  higher  This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock s earnings outlook is more positive 
Based on the latest available data  LRCX has gained about 10 46  so far this year  Meanwhile  the Computer and Technology sector has returned an average of 4 99  on a year to date basis  This shows that Lam Research is outperforming its peers so far this year 
To break things down more  LRCX belongs to the Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry  a group that includes 5 individual companies and currently sits at  1 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained an average of 12 11  so far this year  so LRCX is slightly underperforming its industry in this area 
Going forward  investors interested in Computer and Technology stocks should continue to pay close attention to LRCX as it looks to continue its solid performance ",2018-05-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-lam-research-lrcx-stock-outpacing-its-computer-and-technology-peers-this-year-200317498,200317498
144341,365856,LRCX,Semiconductor Canaries  Chirp  Warble  Soon A Croak And Silence ,opinion,"In light of earnings reactions in the Semiconductor Equipment sector  it s time for an update of a theme we have had in play since November  2017
The canary is no longer chirping in a healthy manner and the economy s coal mine has a toxic gas leak  While the recent Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  earnings report was pretty good and there were positive aspects to that of Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   these highly cyclical companies that have been at the front end of the entire economic cycle that had its beginnings in 2013 are showing signs of wear 
Business is still good but when you are talking about cyclical leaders  it is growth rate that matters  I have read article after article touting strong current business and future drivers that will change the typical Semiconductor cycle as next generation Fabs are needed for ever more dynamic specialty chips for higher end devices 
According to    CEO Gary Dickerson told investors on a conference call 

Smartphone sales have been below expectations  particularly for high end models  and in response  both semiconductor and display suppliers have made adjustments to their capacity planning
With inventory rebalance that we re seeing from smartphones  we re going to see a sequential dip in the Q3  But from our guidance into Q4  you can see that it recovers nicely into Q4 

Taking the pulse of the analyst community  from the large houses to the boutiques to the chattering blogosphere  the theme seems to be that a buying opportunity is developing for the likes of AMAT and LRCX  two excellent companies  If you take Applied CEO Gary Dickerson s view at face value  a decline in these stocks would be exactly that  an opportunity 
But as someone from the real world  as opposed to the Armani wearing analyst community  I can tell you that these companies have no better visibility than you or I  How can they  The global macro economy is subject to many inputs and if future outcomes were that easy to read  we d all be rich beyond our wildest dreams because we d have already seen around every corner  The global economy  while healthy now is not immune to the business cycle 
So here is a corner to look around  We began using this chart in Q4 2017 after a major financial media outlet published an article touting these two companies as great values for great investment returns in 2018  Leadership by the Semi Equipment companies has flattened out 

 is the November 21 2017 post in which we disputed the sensational MSM headline   Fund manager looks beyond  FAANG  stocks and finds even bigger winners for 2018 
And now this morning in pre market we have a reaction to AMAT s earnings  From Yahoo Finance 

While other aspects of the market are positive this morning  we are looking at a progression of cyclicality and that progression  as we have noted many times since using it toward a positive cyclical view in early 2013 is 
Semi Equipment   Semiconductors   General Manufacturing   Economy   Employment   Cemented Opinions of the Herd
Okay  I know it s simple but when confronted with legions of analytical entities with firmed up views  like a buying opportunity in Semi Equipment  it pays to at least consider that when we became constructive on not only the Semi sector but looking forward  the economy as well  it was not canaries we were hearing  it was crickets  As in  cue the crickets  in the economic analytical community  That was the response when we claimed a positive cycle was at hand 
Now  Your favorite buttoned down analyst and or your favorite financial blogger may be on the opposite side and an article like the one you are reading right now is definitely in the minority  I expect the response to be largely  cue the crickets   
This chart dials out to the late 2012 low and new cycle leadership by the two major Semi Equipment companies over the general sector  Each ratio is currently in a nasty looking pattern that is not likely to be improved after today s market activity 

At this point I want to give proof that I am not just some bear waiting interminably to finally give you the big  I told you so   a few years after establishing a bias 
When it was time to call b s on the  end of the Semi cycle  that the major media were scaring everyone with after Microchip Semi s  NASDAQ MCHP  dour forward forecast  the media incorrectly dubbed MCHP a  canary in a coal mine  for the Semi sector  in 2014  we disputed that assertion per this post 
And then there was the disturbance in 2015 2016  in which we kept NFTRH subscribers on course with the correct   as opposed to media instigated    May 30  2016 
It is vital to show your work  just as you had to do in grade school  Otherwise you are just spewing opinions  stirring emotions and or confirming peoples  bias  I don t go negative unless given reason  with a great example being    February 24  2014  on the over hyped 3D Printing mania that the Armani suits were shoving down peoples  throats  Shortly after it was written  at the height of the promotion and ridiculous valuation  the sector imploded 
One SeekingAlpha article recently cited Semiconductor industry experts as a guide to a bullish view on the industry  Lest you think I am grabbing data out of thin air  realize that I have used that source    for both positive and negative views  They no longer publish the Semi bookings side of the book to bill ratio  b2b  we found so important to guiding a bull view back in 2013 and reaffirming it in 2016  But they do provide ongoing analysis  The issue is in the interpretation of the data 
Today s happy go lucky analysts see the still positive projected growth for 2018 and headlines like this and project positive outcomes well into the future  See   

Others on the other hand  try to look around corners  whether toward positive or negative outcomes  Add the slowing Fab Equipment growth rate to the list of negatives that the charts and now  corporate guidance are starting to burp up 
As a final thought  consider that no single analyst should ever put out a view for peoples  consumption that is set in stone  to be defended come hell or high water  That only ends up hurting those who believe in the authority with which the analyst seems to speak 
So if I am wrong and the sector is only providing a buying opportunity  as in 2014 and 2016  then so be it  Adjustments will be made  I am not marrying the view  But since last November when a goofy MSM headline called my attention to the subject  I have not seen much to dissuade a negative Semi Equipment view and hence  eventually a negative economic cycle view  Patience and perspective  as always ",2018-05-21,Gary Tanashian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/semiconductor-canaries-chirp-warble-soon-a-croak-and-silence-200317644,200317644
144346,365861,LRCX,5 Low Price to Book Value Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,In value analysis  though price to earnings  P E  and price to sales  P S  are most preferred by investors  the underrated price to book ratio  P B ratio  is also an easy to use valuation tool for identifying low priced stocks with exceptional returns  The ratio is used to compare a stock s market value price to its book value The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market price per share book value of equity per shareP B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share  So  if the share price is  10 and book value of equity is  5  investors are ready to pay two times the book value What is Book Value Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditures  high debt companies  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should also analyze other ratios like P E  P S  and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is

earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete

with President Trump pledging support for the beleaguered Chinese telecom firm  ZTE  HK 0763   and the Qualcomm NXP merger review process getting a roll on with urgency from the top administration of China  Although apprehensions related to the U S  pullout from the Iran nuclear deal remained a subtle threat  overall markets appeared to be headed for a smooth sail As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate

144405,365920,LRCX,Has Lam Research  LRCX  Outpaced Other Computer And Technology Stocks This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Computer and Technology space have likely heard of Lam Research  LRCX   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  By taking a look at the stock s year to date performance in comparison to its Computer and Technology peers  we might be able to answer that question 
Lam Research is one of 635 individual stocks in the Computer and Technology sector  Collectively  these companies sit at  4 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups 
The Zacks Rank is a successful stock picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months  LRCX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  
Over the past 90 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for LRCX s full year earnings has moved 4 80  higher  This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock s earnings outlook is improving 
Our latest available data shows that LRCX has returned about 3 43  since the start of the calendar year  At the same time  Computer and Technology stocks have gained an average of 2 94   This shows that Lam Research is outperforming its peers so far this year 
Looking more specifically  LRCX belongs to the Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry  which includes 5 individual stocks and currently sits at  4 in the Zacks Industry Rank  On average  stocks in this group have gained 5 29  this year  meaning that LRCX is slightly underperforming its industry in terms of year to date returns 
Investors in the Computer and Technology sector will want to keep a close eye on LRCX as it attempts to continue its solid performance ",2018-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/has-lam-research-lrcx-outpaced-other-computer-and-technology-stocks-this-year-200311729,200311729
144438,365953,LRCX,Selling Puts To Become An Investor,opinion,"Here s a simple option trading strategy for times when a stock you d like to buy experiences a price downturn which you think is temporary and you d like to be a contrarian and get long  
Instead of simply  buying the dip   sell out of the money puts 
The beauty of the strategy is that even if you re wrong about the direction of the stock price  you can still make money  
Using Implied Volatility to Work for You
The reason this trade can work so well is that when a stock goes down  the implied volatility of the options   especially puts   usually goes up  It s a well known fact that stocks tend to fall more steeply than they rise   Bad news affects the price to the downside more than good news does to the upside   The magnitude and speed of downside moves tend to be greater 
Since traders are willing to pay more for options on a stock that is moving  or likely to move  they raise the volatility component in their pricing models  raising the price they are willing to pay for options 
In fact  the sophisticated options pricing models used by professional options market makers usually have this change in volatility built in   When the stock price declines  volatility inputs are automatically raised 
This means that in periods of high volatility  especially on moves to the downside  option sellers receive higher than normal premiums  
If you were thinking of buying the stock anyway  selling out of the money puts can be a less expensive way to go about it   If the stock continues to decline through the strike price of the put you sold  the option will end up in the money at expiration and you will be obligated to buy the stock at the strike price  
Your net price on the purchase will be the strike price minus the premium you collected on the sale   Because the put was out of the money when you sold it  it has a strike lower than the current stock price  your basis for the purchase will be lower than the market price for the stock was when you initiated the option trade   effectively a discount 
If the stock doesn t decline below your strike price  your put will expire out of the money and you will keep the entire premium  
Obviously  there s risk associated with this strategy because if the stock price continues to decline  you own it and will suffer losses   It s the identical risk you assume whenever you buy a stock 
Example 
Lam Research  LCRX  is down  14 50 on changing outlooks about the semiconductor industry   You know that Lam is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has a VGM score of B   You think the market reaction is overdone and want to become an investor at the current stock price of  189   Instead of simply buying the stock  you sell the 185 strike put expiring on May 20th at the current bid of  6 
If the stock is trading below  185 at expiration  your  now in the money  option will be assigned and you will purchase the stock for  185   Because you collected  6 in premium on the option sale  your basis price is  179  a more than 5  discount to the  189 you were going to pay 
If the stock doesn t go any lower than  185 or rallies instead  you keep the whole  6    Since standard options contracts are for 100 shares of stock  each expired put represents a profit of  600  
Some notes on this trade   
Earnings announcements
Be careful about selling options right before or after quarterly earnings announcements in the stock   Implied volatilities  especially in short dated options  tend to rise going into a scheduled announcement because of the potential of a surprise beat or miss to move the stock quickly   Volatilities will then decline sharply after results are announced and any resulting move in the stock happens 
If you sell a put right before earnings  you ll collect a high premium  but put yourself at risk of a big loss if the company misses and the stock declines If you sell a put right after earnings  the stock decline has likely already happened and the premium you receive will be much lower 
Risk and Margin
Because of the risk involved  brokerage houses generally require that you have available cash or margin in your account to complete the purchase of the stock in the event that the option ends in the money and you are assigned   Some houses may also require that you are experienced in trading and or well capitalized before allowing you to execute a sale in an uncovered option   You will need to square this away before you trade

stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include IBM   NYSE IBM    McDonald s   NYSE MCD    Gilead   NASDAQ GILD    Phillips 66   NYSE PSX   and Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Top Research Reports for IBM  McDonalds and GileadThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including IBM  McDonald s and Gilead  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see all of IBM s shares have underperformed the broader market on a year to date basis  losing  3  vs  the S P 500 s  1 2  gain  IBM s first quarter 2018 results were unimpressive  Although revenues and earnings per share increased from the year ago quarter  the growth rates reflected sluggishness  This can primarily be attributed to the company s ongoing heavily time consuming business model transition to cloud Additionally  intensifying competition is a major concern  Nevertheless  improving position in the cloud  security and analytics bodes well  Moreover  accretive acquisitions have expanded IBM s product portfolio into higher growth segments  such as Cloud computing and Big Data Further  expanding footprint in the rapidly growing blockchain market is positive  However  the Zacks analyst thinks these emerging fields as well as the strategic imperatives will take some more time to report meaningful growth and offset weakness in the traditional business  You can   Shares of McDonald s have gained  21 4  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Restaurants industry which has gained  9 7  over the same period  Notably  growing guest count remains McDonald s top priority and it is undertaking various sales and digital initiatives to this end  Increased focus on delivery  enhancement of digital capabilities  and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the U S should drive growth too Efforts to attract customers in International Lead   High Growth Markets also bode well  In fact  global comps at McDonald s have been positive over the past eight quarters  Yet  high labor costs and currency headwinds might keep profits under pressure Earnings estimates for the current year have declined over the last two months raising concerns  Even so  augmented focus on refranchising will cut the company s capital requirements and facilitate EPS growth and ROE expansion in the long run  You can   Buy ratedGilead s shares have outperformed the Zacks Biotech industry in the last one year  increasing  13 8  vs  a decline of  6 8   Gilead s HIV franchise continues to gain traction  courtesy of the rapid adoption of TAF based regimens in the United States and EU The TAF based regimens now represent 62  of total HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya  Odefsey and Descovy in 2016  The approval of Gilead s latest triple HIV therapy  Biktarvy  is likely to provide an impetus to the stock as Gilead is now banking on its HIV franchise and newer avenues like the CAR T therapy post Kite acquisition However  the HCV franchise is under tremendous pressure due to lower patient starts and increasing competition  Both pricing and market share are expected to stabilize by mid 2018 while patient starts are expected to decline further  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Phillips 66 and Lam Research The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All Last year  it generated  8 billion in

144440,365955,LRCX,Weighing The Week Ahead  The Costly Quest For Fresh Fears  ,opinion,"The economic calendar is normal  with an emphasis on housing and sentiment data  Earnings season is in full swing and expectations remain high  We have witnessed improvement on several fronts  Since that is not very newsworthy  the punditry will be asking 
Where can we find some fresh fears 
Last Week Recap
In my last edition of WTWA I asked whether strong earnings were already reflected in stock prices  That was a good guess  as each good earnings report was explained as  strong  or  anticipated   depending upon whether the stock subsequently moved higher or lower

The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
Feel free to add items that I have missed  Please keep in mind that we are looking for current news  especially from the last week or so  WTWA is not about long term concerns like debt  These are important  of course  but not our weekly subject unless there has been some major change 
The Good

High frequency indicators remain positive    
Industrial production increased 0 5   down from 1 0  in February  but beating expectations of 0 3      and see the Big Four update below 
Hotel occupancy broke records in Q1  Some astute readers pointed out that a past analysis was wrong because of holiday timing  Mrs  OldProf  who reads both the posts and the comments each week  jumped on this   See  your readers agree with me   Thirty eight years and as mistake prone as ever   provides analysis and this chart 



Retail sales increased 0 6   beating expectations of a 0 4  bump 
Mortgage delinquency rates are lower  Those thirty days past due   3 73   In foreclosure   0 63      
Corporate earnings are strong  regardless of the chosen metric   beat rate  size of earnings and revenue beats   

To date  17  of the companies in the S P 500 have reported actual results for Q1 2018  In terms of earnings  more companies are reporting actual EPS above estimates  80   compared to the 5 year average  In aggregate  companies are reporting earnings that are 5 9  above the estimates  which is also above the five year average  In terms of sales  more companies  72   are reporting actual sales above estimates compared to the five year average  In aggregate  companies are reporting sales that are 1 6  above estimates  which is also above the five year average 

  but is more concerned about the effect of higher interest rates 

Corporate cash is increasing    suggesting room for higher dividends and more stock buybacks  David Templeton    explains  illustrating with this chart 



Housing starts for March hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1319K  beating expectations by 4   Building permits of 1354K also beat expectations   on the data  mostly due to multi family starts  and also on    down one point at 69  but still on  firm ground  


The Bad

Jobless claims were almost unchanged from last week at 232K  but this was 5K worse than expectations    
The Beige Book supported the current Fed picture of modest growth  but also had some warnings about the impact of current policies  Companies mentioned spikes in aluminum and steel prices     
Leading indicators increased only 0 3   This is a gain  of course  but smaller than the February pace of 0 7  and slightly below expectations of 0 4    analysis and charts 


The Ugly
How about something that is responsible for 2 3 million annual deaths  From the  

Today around 2 8 billion people   38  of the global population and almost 50  of the population in developing countries   lack access to clean cooking  Most of them cook their daily meals using solid biomass in traditional stoves  In 25 countries  mostly in sub Saharan Africa  more than 90  of households rely on wood  charcoal and waste for cooking  Collecting this fuel requires hundreds of billions of hours each year  disproportionately affecting women and children  Burning it creates noxious fumes linked to 2 8 million premature deaths annually 

 explains 

The report estimates that an investment of an additional  42 billion  above and beyond what is already happening  would be needed by 2030 to provide access to clean cooking for the 2 3 billion people who otherwise will not have access to clean cooking by that time  At one level   42 billion is a lot of money  at another level  it s almost an absurdly cheap price to pay for the potential benefits 

The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
We have a normal economic calendar  featuring housing data  Consumer confidence and sentiment  and the first look at Q1 GDP  Corporate earnings reports will again be the most important real news 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
The economic calendar emphasizes housing data and sentiment polls  The focus  barring important tweets to the contrary will continue to be corporate earnings reports 
The quest to find an explanation for every market move reached a new peak last week  With evidence of good earnings  a stronger economy  and positive sentiment  an explanation was needed for the volatile market  Why is it flat at lower levels  I expect pundits and financial writers to be asking 
Where can we find some fresh fears 
One of the better CNBC anchors gave us a taste of what to expect  Chip stocks had moved lower  mostly because of events related to a single stock  With the ETF connections and algorithmic trading  the entire sector got hit and dragged the market down as well   That s the best I can do here  but I promise more in a special post  Meanwhile  I love most chip stocks  especially Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   
The anchor asked her guest  Aren t semiconductor stocks cyclical  If this is the top of the cycle  what does it say about the overall economy 
That question could be a litmus test for traders versus investors 
There is plenty of reaching to find something wrong  and that was just one example  Here are some currently raised concerns 

Yield curve inversion  So many who are rookies at recession forecasting are jumping on the yield curve inversion  Dr  Robert Dieli  the top expert on this topic  repeatedly warns not to forecast this signal  When it occurs  it will still provide lead time of about nine months  And it is more than just the yield curve  One must also consider the economic background and confirming indicators  Despite this  many are reaching far into the future 

   a real possibility in the next 18 months  I frequently cite Hale on various topics  but economic forecasting is not his happy zone  Speculating on this topic is not helpful to investors 
Another favorite source    seems to be reaching on this topic 
  citing Dan Clifton  a good source    My take from discussing the issue with clients is that the headwinds from a possible trade war are colliding with the tailwinds from  300 billion of additional stimulus from spending on top of the recently enacted tax cuts  


The Fed  A knee jerk reaction to the direction of Fed moves and old slogans  Those citing this fear pay little attention to the starting level of rates  the pace of change  or the criteria for increases  stronger economic data   Throw in the changes in Fed membership and leadership  and it is open season     
The end of QE  Those who were wrong about QE effects  hyperinflation  and attributed stronger equity markets to Fed policy are now taking the other side  This gives them a chance to be wrong in both directions 
Debt 

Global  Now at  164 trillion  225  of global GDP    


US government debt  It is growing rapidly  and the pace cannot be sustained 
The pension time bomb   400 trillion by 2050     





Trump Administration policies  especially regarding trade 

And here are some sensible refutations 

Yield curve 

 

Flat or inverted yield curves tell us something about 


Recessions   Inverted yield curves precede recessions although flat curves can last for a long time before becoming inverted or showing a recession signal  All recessions are preceded by inversions but not all inversions lead to recessions 


Fed behavior   Flattening and inverted yield curve are associated with tightening of Fed policy  but tightening does not mean that a market sell off or recession is around the corner  The link between the beginning of the tightening cycle and the impact on financial markets is loose 


Term premium risk   Flat yield curves tell investors there is no compensation for taking duration risk  There is limited reason to take marginal duration risk  We find that flat curves signal future increases in yield  It is a negative signal for bonds 


Equity markets   Flatter yield curve do not mean lower stock returns  Flattening curves are not associated with market sell offs 

If you do not understand the chart below  you should be especially careful about reading scary stories about the yield curve  It is more than the slope of the curve  it depends upon how it happens 


 that the inversion is a leading indicator  and the lead time may be significant 



 takes a balanced approach  citing some  ahem  other good sources 
Bob Dieli continues to deliver the best analysis of the business cycle  His monthly report is chock full of data  analysis  and even some humor   if you are willing to go with economist jokes  Here is his current business cycle rating  You will not agree  Please note that he has been correct while almost everyone else has been wrong  The current expansion could have years to run

144468,365983,LRCX,Should You Buy Lam Research  LRCX  Stock Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX   moved slightly lower during morning trading hours Monday  just one day before the company is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings results  The red hot run of the semiconductor market has been challenged lately  so investors will want to pay close attention to the report of a major supplier like Lam 
Lam Research provides market leading equipment and services for the fabrication of integrated circuits  Its products are used primarily in wafer processing a key step in the manufacturing process that includes the creation of active components like transistors and capacitors  The company also exposure to wafer level packaging and microelectromechanical systems 
The strength of the semiconductor business has created a rise in demand for Lam Research s solutions  and investors have rewarded this uptick in business by lifting the stock more than 60  over the past year  But what should we expect from Lam Research s soon to be reported quarter  Let s take a closer look 
Latest Outlook and Valuation
Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates  we expect Lam Research to post adjusted earnings of  4 36 per share and total revenue of  2 85 billion  These results would represent year over year growth rates of 55 7  and 32 4   respectively 
Heading into the week  Lam Research was trading with a Forward P E of 12 3  which is a noticeable discount to its industry s average of 16 3  Within the past year  the stock has traded as high as 16 2x forward 12 month earnings and as low as 10 0x  Its median earnings multiple over that time is 13 6x  Investors might conclude that LRCX is cheap ahead of its report compared to its industry peers and where it has traded recently 
Earnings ESP Whispers
Investors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Lam Research surprises investors with better than anticipated earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Lam Research is currently holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an Earnings ESP of  0 6   This means that the most recent analyst estimates have been slightly lower than the consensus  In other words  our model is not conclusively calling for a beat 
Surprise History
Another important thing to consider ahead of Lam Research s report is the company s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices  The firm is a consistent earnings performer and has met or surpassed consensus estimates in each of the trailing 22 quarters 
But we judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report  LRCX has moved higher in three out of the previous four quarters during this window

144495,366010,LRCX,An Early Preview Of Lam Research s  LRCX  Earnings Outlook,opinion,"Shares of Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX   sunk on Thursday as markets rebounded  But with the current overall turmoil  investors should focus more on the company s quarterly earnings outlook than Lam s recently fluctuating stock price   
Despite Lam s recent downturn  shares are up nearly 58  over the last year  The wafer fabrication equipment company has consistently impressed investors with its ability to post solid earnings and strong sales 
Going forward  Lam s products  which are essential to the semiconductor industry  will likely become even more valuable in the rapidly growing information age  In fact  CEO Martin Anstice  that  the fundamental future of Lam Research is inextricably linked to the rising importance of a data economy  
With that said  let s look to see if the Fremont  California based firm will benefit from the proliferation of connected devices in its soon to be reported quarter 
Latest Outlook 
Lam s quarterly revenues are expected to surge by 32 4  to reach 2 85 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Meanwhile  the company is projected to see its quarterly earnings soar by 55 7  to hit  4 36 per share 
However  within the last 60 days  there has been zero earnings estimate revision activity for Lam s upcoming quarter 
Valuation
LRCX s Forward P E of 12 2 currently marks a substantial discount to the  Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication  industry average  which is trading at 15 9x forward earnings at the moment  Lam s present valuation also marks a discount compared to the median Forward P E of 13 8 it traded at over the last year 
Price Performance and Surprise History
Another important thing to consider ahead of LRCX s upcoming financial report is the company s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices Lam Research Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   We can see that Lam has posted strong results when it comes to topping earnings estimates over the last few of years  Investors should note that these earnings surprises don t always lead to strong stock price momentum in the immediate aftermath of a report 
In fact  last quarter  shares of Lam plummeted after posting a 17 6  earnings surprise 
Bottom Line
Past performance is no indication of future success  and projecting becomes increasingly hard in a volatile market  With that said  it is worth remembering that both Lam s top and bottom lines are expected to surge this quarter  Furthermore  Lam is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Lam is scheduled to report its March quarter 2018 financial results after market close on Tuesday  April 17 
Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2018-04-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/an-early-preview-of-lam-researchs-lrcx-earnings-outlook-200303541,200303541
144496,366011,LRCX,Is LAM Research  LRCX  A Strong Momentum Stock ,opinion," The trend is your friend  is an age old saying that most momentum investors live by  The main concerns in momentum investing are simple  when will the trend end if a stock is going strong  and when will it start for an up and coming stock  Today we ll look into LAM Research   NASDAQ LRCX   to see if we can find a solution for this particular company 
LAM Research is a leading semiconductor company based in Fremont  California  Known for its wafer fabrication equipment and services  the company has been a strong stock for the past five years and on  It currently holds a  B  grade in Value  a  C  grade in Growth  and an  A  grade in Momentum  This earns LAM Research a  B  overall VGM grade in our Styles Score System 
LAM Research has been holding strong in the Style Scores  but the key factor is its  A  grade in the Momentum category  Let s take a look at what the stock has done to deserve this mark 
A Closer Look
LAM Research s stock price has been on the up and up for a considerably long span of time  and all signs point to more of this  Five years ago  its stock was at  41 81 per share  A 461  increase in price over that span has shown just how strong the momentum of this stock has been over this longer period of time 
This past year alone  stock prices increased 90  from  120 60 to  228 65 per share  marking the highest it s been since the company went public 
There have been several concerns in regards to recent drops in the stock  but LAM Research always seems to bounce back  In November of last year  shares were priced at  218 91  and dropped to  184 23 by early December  only to return to  215 07 by mid January of this year  Following this high  the stock plummeted to  162 23 in a matter of weeks  again only to return to its peak price of  228 56 in early March 
These fluctuations may scare some investors  but considering that LAM Research has repeatedly stabilized  even exceeding its highest price after these drops  helps to prove that its shares are stable  Couple this with the fact that the tech industry as a whole has been in a slump over the past few weeks  and it is quite impressive the company has been able to do what it is doing 
Cash Flow  Share can also be a strong indicator of stock prices  LAM Research yields  13 19 in cash per share  almost twice its industry average of  6 33 share  This sheds a positive light on the state of the business as is  and in the time to come 
For those momentum investors who prefer to ride a trend into the long run  LAM Research s EPS Growth for the next three to five years is expected to reach an annualized rate of 17 9   meaning investors can feel secure knowing that any short  term drops might be overridden in the long run   
Another great bonus to consider is that  despite its amazing statistics and domination over its competitors in the industry in a number of categories  LAM Research s P E of 11 6 is still under the industry average of 12 3  Growth investors will usually pay a high price for investments like these  but for LAM Research there is no need 
Bottom Line
LAM Research holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   It trades for a fair price relative to the industry and has numbers to support its stability  Its stock price increase  cash flow per share  and expected EPS Growth for the next three to five years suggest its share price will continue to rise  LAM Research appears to be a solid momentum option for both the short and long run investor

With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

Review 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question   We considered the reality that a variety of market leading stocks had sold off in recent weeks  but asked the question  how do you distinguish between buying opportunities and red flags   Maintaining a  shopping list  was one suggested solution  Additionally  multiple comments on the article suggested using  good  til cancelled  orders was worthwhile for some  A glance at your news feed will show that the key points remain relevant 
This Week  Are You A Contrarian Trend Follower 
There are periods and market conditions under which certain trading strategies work relatively well and relatively less well  For example  Warren Buffett  an investor  not a trader  once used the concept of the  three I s  to explain the natural progression of how a good new idea can go wrong  According to  with Buffett 

First come the innovators  who see opportunities that others don t  Then come the imitators  who copy what the innovators have done  And then come the idiots  whose avarice undoes the very innovations they are trying to use to get rich 

In the case of trend following  whether you are early or late can make all the difference in the world  For example  according to this recent  by Mark Rzepczynski 

The best time to buy  a performance trend  is when returns are low and the best time to sell is when performance is high  Be a trend following contrarian  There is evidence that this approach works 

It seems Mr  Rzepczynski is suggesting that if you re going to be a trend follower  get in early  as an innovator  before the trend is already delivering big returns  And when a trend is delivering big relative returns  that s the time to consider your exit 
Alternatively  Rzepczynski suggests another approach is to passively implement your trend following strategy  Specifically 

The trend following properties of diversification should lead to a constant allocation 

However  investors should be aware 

there will come times when strong performance will be reversed or at least the return to risk will turn down  Similarly  there will periods when poor performance will be reversed because risk taking is reduced or the period of no trends is finished 

If you re going to implement a trend following strategy  thinking like a contrarian can be very helpful  as paradoxical as that may sound 
Model Performance 
Per reader feedback  we re continuing to share the performance of our trading models  Keep in mind  as alluded to above  every trading method has strongest and weakest times  Our group is excellent in a big market decline  since it has a signal for a complete exit  They also work well in flat or rising markets  effectively capturing individual stock gains  In some sense  the current time is  in between   The models would be doing better if the market action was either better or worse

Over time  we find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 
And for these reasons  I am changing the  Trade with Jeff  offer at Seeking Alpha to include a 50 50 split between Holmes and Athena  Current participants have already agreed to this  Since our costs on Athena are lower  we have also lowered the fees for the combination

Expert Picks From The Models 
This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by Blue Harbinger   Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas  
Holmes  This week I reduced my position in Stamps com  NASDAQ STMP   If you recall  I purchased these shares on 3 1 for  189 50  and I sold about 15  of the holdings on 3 29 for  200 80 
Blue Harbinger  Interesting move  Holmes  What happened you don t like internet based shipping solutions anymore 
Holmes  I typically hold for about 6 weeks  this trade was slightly less   and I exit when my price target is achieved or based on Macro conditions  Here is a look at the one  year technical chart as well as the 4 week chart for STMP showing the hold period and sale of the stock this week 


BH  It looks like you made some money not a lot  but in these market conditions a profit is a profit  The stock tends to be fairly volatile  especially considering the company s history of beating quarterly earnings expectations  as shown below   and I see the dip you bought 

Homes  That is correct  I am a dip buyer  And I typically hold for about six weeks 
BH  Here is a look at the FastGraph for STMP  This company has been moving in the right direction 

Holmes  Let s hope it keeps moving in the right direction  considering I m still holding more shares  Anyway  how about you Road Runner any trades this week 
Road Runner  Yes  This week I sold semiconductor company  Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   I bought these shares on 03 01 for   193 86  and sold them on 03 29 for  200 75 


BH  Nice one  Road Runner looks like another profitable trade  But why did you sell 
Road Runner  I hold momentum stocks for 4 weeks  STMP was up during that time period  and I exited at a profit 
BH  Okay that s straight forward enough  How about you Athena did you actually buy or sell anything this week 
Athena  Yes I bought shares of XL Group  NYSE XL  this week on 4 2  Are you familiar with the company 

BH  Yes  XL Group is an insurance and reinsurance company  And you are aware that AXA  PA AXAF  to buy XL Group for approximately  57 60 per share  correct Athena  That s why the price leaped in March 
Athena  Yes I am aware  I bought the shares at a lower price on Monday  essentially locking in a decent return between the current price an the acquisition price  assuming the deal goes through 
BH  Very interesting  Athena  Completion of the transaction is still subject to approval by XL Group shareholders and other customary closing conditions  including the receipt of required regulatory approvals  and is expected to take place during the second half of 2018 

Athena  I am aware of that too  I expect the share price to approach the deal price in the coming weeks  It s basically upside with very little downside risk 
BH  I ll be keeping an eye on this one  Thanks for sharing  Athena  And how about you  Felix do you have anything to share this week
Felix  Yes  this week I ran the list of S P 400 Midcap stocks through my model  and I have included the top 20 rankings in the following list 

BH  Thanks for sharing  Felix  Remind us  what type of trader are you 
Felix  I am a momentum trader  I hold my positions considerably longer than the other traders typically around 66 weeks  And I exit when my price target is achieved  I also use macro factors and some customized stop orders for risk management purposes 
BH  I see you have a REIT at  2 JBG Smith Properties  NYSE JBGS   This company owns and operates mainly office building assets in the Washington DC area  Seems like an attractive high demand area  considering there is no shortage of politicians and pundits in Washington DC 
Felix  Thanks  How about you  Oscar what do you have for us this week 
Oscar  This week I ran the high volume ETFs through my model  and I ve included the top 20 rankings in the following list 

BH  I see EEM  EFA and EWZ near the top of your list  These are all international ETFs from iShares  one emerging markets  EEM   one developed markets  EFA   and one Brazil ETF  EWZ    What is it you like about these ETFs  Oscar 
Oscar  I too am a momentum trader  however I only hold my positions for about 6 weeks before rotating into something else  All three of the ETFs you mentioned have attractive upside potential during that time period 
BH  I like those ETFs because iShares manages them efficiently  and keeps the costs low  Plus it s not a bad idea to have some non US diversification 
Oscar  I m not interested in them for the diversification  I like them because they have upside in the coming weeks 
BH  Thanks Oscar  I ll keep an eye on these ETFs  and then check back with you in a few weeks 
Conclusion 
Trading strategies perform differently under different market conditions  However  it can be a mistake to simply follow whatever strategy has been working best lately  as that strategy my be closer to the end than to the beginning of its relative success  It is possible to be a contrarian trend follower  in the sense that trends that have been working best often revert toward the mean  while those that have been performing less well often revert back to better performance  Identifying trends early  as well as being conginzant of when they re winding down  can be important keys to success

144515,366030,LRCX,Why Lam Research  LRCX  Is A Strong Buy Stock,opinion,"Shares of Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX   surged over 3  on Wednesday as part of a run that has seen the company s stock price climb nearly 19  in the last 12 weeks alone  The wafer fabrication equipment company has consistently impressed shareholders over the last year  so let s take a look at why Lam looks poised to continue its current run of success 
Recent News
Lam manufactures products that are essential to the semiconductor industry and help fuel the information age  The company recently highlighted some of the biggest factors that are set to contribute to its growth at its 2018 investors meeting 
Lam noted that 67 zettabytes equal to 67 trillion gigabytes of data will be generated by 2020   We are literally just scratching the surface of what is possible in the world of data   Lam CEO Martin Anstice    We believe that the fundamental future of Lam Research is inextricably linked to the rising importance of a data economy  
Lam also recently unveiled a plan to return at least 50  of free cash flow to stockholders over the next five years  Starting in the June quarter  Lam will also increase its quarterly dividend by 120  to  1 10 per share 
On top of those initiatives  Lam announced an additional  2 billion share repurchase program  which brings its total authorization to  4 billion since Nov  2017  The Fremont  California based company hopes to execute this plan over the next 12 to 18 months 
Growth Fundamentals 
Lam is expected to see its current quarter earnings skyrocket by nearly 56  to  4 36 per share  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  The tech firm is also expected to see its quarterly revenues surge over 32  to reach  2 85 billion 
The company s full year earnings are expected to skyrocket by nearly 68  to reach  16 74 per share  while Lam s full year sales are projected to jump by 35  to hit  10 85 billion 
Looking even further down the road  Lam is expected to see its EPS figure expand at an annualized rate of 14 9  over the next three to five years 
Investors will also be happy to note that the company has experienced a slew of estimate revisions recently  with 100  agreement to the upside for both its current quarter and full year 
Solid Value
Shares of Lam have skyrocketed over 76  in the last year and surged 13  in the last month  yet its stock price currently rests below its 52 week high  Despite this climb  Lam is also currently trading at 13 1x forward earnings  which falls slightly below the  Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication  industry s average P E of 13 5 
 
 
Lam has also consistently traded at a discount to its larger peer group  which includes Applied Material   NASDAQ AMAT    during this same time frame 
Bottom Line 
Lam is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports a  B  grade for Value in our Style Scores system  The company is also projected to grow both its top and bottom lines at sizable rates this year  Meanwhile  the stock looks undervalued at its current level  leaving plenty of room for profits

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Texas Instruments  TXN   Statoil  OL STL   STO  and Comcast  CMCSA   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy rated Texas Instruments  shares have gained  9 5  over the last three months  outperforming the Zacks General Semiconductor industry which has gained  9 2  over the same period  The Zacks analyst likes its prudent R D investments in several high margin  high growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets  This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and dollar content at customers  while reducing exposure to volatile consumer computing markets  
Margins continue to expand on secular strength in the auto and industrial markets and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300 millimeter Analog output  Continuous dividend hikes are a big positive  However  increasing competition  unfavorable currency effect and a high debt load remain concerns

Shares of Strong Buy rated Statoil are up  32 7  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry  up  9 3    Statoil is one of the major carbon efficient producers of oil and natural gas in the world  In fact  the company s production  especially in the Norwegian Continental Shelf  emits the lowest carbon in the industry   
During the fourth quarter  Statoil s earnings beat expectations and revenues increased annually  The growth can be attributed to higher equity and entitlement production along with increased realized liquids prices  The company s Board of directors has also proposed to increase dividend for the fourth quarter by 4 5   
The Zacks analyst expects growth from new upstream projects in various prospective fields of Norway  The company s strong cost control efforts amid weak oil and gas pricing environment are a big positive  During fourth quarter 2017  Statoil managed to lower its exploration expenses by 55  
 You can   
Comcast s shares have outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry in the last three months  gaining  11 3  vs   6 3   Comcast has started the nationwide rollout of the DOCSIS 3 1 technology  with its latest xFi Advanced Gateway  Moreover  Comcast completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand  with plans to include YouTube in its X1 video platform  
Additionally  Comcast is venturing into residential solar programs with Sunrun  It is also working towards 5G network deployment and expanding its theme park business  However  the Zacks analyst remains concerned about the company s operations in a saturated and competitive multi channel U S  video market  
Comcast lost 33 000 video customers and 13 000 voice customers in the fourth quarter of 2017  due to cord cutting and stiff competition  Additionally  the company s high debt levels and consolidation related woes are potential hazards

144600,366115,LRCX,Stocks Halfway Back From Correction Lows,opinion,"For the first time since January 26  we can boast about a positive week for the market  The major indices finished on the plus side in each of the last five days  except for the NASDAQ today   Along the way  they took a big bite out of the selloff losses  The NASDAQ gained more than 5  this week  while the Dow and S P each jumped by more than 4   
	In Friday s session  the Dow rose by 0 08  to 25 219 4 and the S P advanced by 0 04  to 2732 2  These totals weren t much to write home about  especially when considering how high these indices were earlier in the day  But the advances were enough to extend their winning streaks to 6 sessions  The NASDAQ  though  just couldn t hold on  It slipped 0 23  to 7239 5  marking the only negative close for a major index this week 
	Now we move on to a short week due to President s Day on Monday  The editors love how the market performed this week  but some of them are still skeptical if this can continue  Did we see the worst of this pullback or is there another drop around the corner  Both viewpoints are represented in the highlights section below  Today s Portfolio Highlights  Large Cap Trader  The portfolio closed out the week with a busy session  Firstly  John sold MKS Instruments  MKSI  and Jones Lang LaSalle  JLL  for gains of 12 7  and 3 4   respectively  These stocks were both bought on January 3  so those profits come in just under a month and a half in the portfolio 
	Then the editor made the following three fairly defensive buys 
	  Wellcare Health  WCG    this is an existing position that was first added in mid 2017  The pullback has provided an opportunity to add 2  more to this managed care services company 
	  Packaging Corp  of America  PKG    a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  leading producer of containerboard and corrugated packaging products 
	  South32 Ltd   SOUHY    a producer ofalumina  aluminum  coal  manganese  nickel  silver  lead and zinc 
	Both of the new buys  PKG   SOUHY  have VGM scores of  A   They also have attractive valuations and pay dividends  John suggests 2  allocations in each  which you can get from the proceeds in MKSI and JLL  Read the complete commentary for more on all of today s moves TAZR Trader  Earlier this week  Kevin was talking about increased incidences of user and advertiser backlash for Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and how it could eventually convince him to sell the name from the portfolio if analysts sour on the growth outlook  Well  today s government indictments alleging Russian interference in U S  politics certainly won t help matters  The company could now be in store for increased regulatory threats  along with public disapproval of the platform  Since Kevin was already thinking about an exit  this news provided the final push  He sold FB on Friday and banked a 30  return  By the way  he also sold part of Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  in a simple rebalancing move to lighten up after its 16  move off the correction lows Insider Trader  Several regional and community banks have seen increased insider activity of late  and Tracey added one of them on Friday  FNB Corp  FNB  is a mid cap regional bank that is trading at a discount despite expectations for higher earnings this year  Specifically  earnings are expected to rise 21  in 2018  So far this month  three directors have bought shares of FNB in a clear sign that they believe the stock is undervalued  Read the full write up for more on this new pick Counterstrike  The portfolio is shorting the Dow  Now there s no need to go crazy  Jeremy doesn t think the bull market is over  but he has been skeptical of this snapback and believes there s a good chance that stocks move lower again  Technically speaking  the 61 8  fib retracement line is holding up at about 22 621 for the Dow  The editor plans to take advantage of this potential pullback with a 13  allocation in ProShares UltraPro Short Dow 30  SDOW   This is an ultra short ETF that reflects three times the movement in the Dow  so if the Dow goes down 1   this fund goes up 3    If the situation changes  then Jeremy would have no problem returning to the bull  But for now  he feels most comfortable with this hedge that leaves the portfolio open for a quick double digit return in the event of another selloff  The full commentary has a lot more on this new position  including a chart that explains the fib retracement line Value Investor  Shares of CAI International  CAI  plunged after it talked about more competitors entering the marketplace  The stock is actually down about 25   But Tracey thinks those comments were blown out of proportion  The editor likes that this company leases both shipping containers and rail cars especially since the latter business is starting to recover amid the strong economy   CAI was cheap before but it s certainly dirt cheap now   she said  Given its attractive valuation and expectations for earnings growth of 32  this year  Tracey decided to add CAI to the portfolio on Friday  The full commentary has her very detailed analysis on this new position  
	Momentum Trader   While that wasn t exactly the sort of follow through I was looking for today  at least there wasn t dramatic selling  Further  the S P 500 did manage to stay above its 50 day moving average 
	 Two things happened today that are important  I gave away the first  with the market closing north of the 50 day  but resistance up at the 61 8  Fib retracement is also noted  However  I am not in the selloff camp as some of my colleagues are  Rather  given the intraday resilience above the 50 day  I think the market has already passed the test and will regroup to start next week 
	 Of course being cautious is always prudent  however I am optimistic for the market next week  This dramatic turnaround the last seven days was just what the doctor ordered  The overhead Fib resistance is noted but I think the close above the 50 day is more indicative of what we can expect to start next week  The bulk of earnings season is behind us which leads me to believe the market will find a direction and stick with it      Dave Bartosiak  who is also editor of Surprise Trader  Have a Great Weekend

144604,366119,LRCX,Semi Bearish On Semiconductors ,opinion,"Over the last several years  beginning in 2013 I ve made post titles like  Semi Bullish  in response to the bullish leading edge economic cycle indicator  the Semiconductor Equipment sector and its implications for broad stocks and the economy  Those implications of economic acceleration were along these lines  Semi Equipment Book to Bill  b2b    Broad Semi   Manufacturing   Employment   Firm Economy  Shortly after the b2b was noted as bullish the SOX index and the S P 500 broke out to new highs  not to even hint at looking back until the rocky 2015 2016 period 
The 2013 period launched everything we know as bullish today  There was a lot of  going on then and  when new and positive signals cropped up amid the Brexit and NIRP  everybody into bonds   hysterics of the time 
Most recently  in  the wordplay was used tongue in cheek to illustrate how we nailed almost to the day the November top in the sector as a mainstream media outlet seized upon peoples  stock market FOMO  fear of missing out   highlighting a fund manager s claims of great gains in 2018 for the likes of AMAT and LRCX 
It is important for someone writing to you professing to have done a good job making calls  to prove it  Hence the links  Let s also realize that nobody gets it right all the time  HUI s 2009 2010  888  technical chart measurement  cough cough    
Predictably  me being me I now annoy you with another play on words going the other way as there are bearish signs cropping up in the economy s leading cyclical edge  While the all important worldwide Semi Equipment book to bill ratio is no longer available  other tools are 
We are currently tracking a technical signal that will be kept mostly private for now  Despite what this article will argue about a potential down move in the sector s leadership  if not the nominal sector itself  the technical views are the final arbiters because as we know  markets can go against their fundamentals for years  Cue the HUI Gold Bugs index rising amid degrading fundamentals  gold price declining vs  mining cost input commodities in an inflationary cycle  from 2005 into 2008 and the H S top we called its  crown of thorns  back then 
So we are using Semi Equipment company relationships to the broader chip making industry and even broader tech industry  These signals led the recent stock market decline and they have also bounced with the stock market bounce  Even as they are an economic cycle signal  they work as a stock market signal as well 
So my question is  if it worked going one way in 2013  why can t it work in reverse now  The progression of deceleration this time would be  Semi Equipment orders flatten   Broad Semiconductor demand eases   Manufacturing eases     Employment weakens   Soft Economy 
Again  I say to you that if I was putting out the bullish stuff at appropriate times  as documented  I have every right to hit you with the bearish stuff as well  Just to show that I am not writing with preconceived agenda  Most people did not listen then  and indeed  had I had the conviction to go all in behind the bull view in 2013 I d be fabulously wealthy now  but I have a vulnerability known as a significant distrust of the Fed  which was the monetary stimulator of the time   Water under the bridge 
  As for the  manufacturing eases  component of the progression  we ve already noted some issues developing there  See 

Manufacturing activity was fine in January as New Orders eased a bit and PMI barely budged  However  the  inflation effects  component  prices  lurched higher  At the same time Employment eased more than just a teeny  That is a concern because based on my experience in manufacturing when materials like these start increasing in price  people start having their wages compacted or start getting shown the door 


Moving on  while keeping the acute Semi signals private  there is some publicly available information showing the potential for the rapid growth in the Semi Equipment and by extension  Semiconductor industry to soften 
Vulnerability  1
How about good old Bitcoin and its crypto friends  After all  Barron s tells us that   That was the type of  everybody to the GREEN side of the boat  stuff going on in 2017  There is plenty more material out there where that came from  indicating secular and unstoppable growth in the usage of Semiconductors  Here  from my  1 information source  SEMI 
You should read the whole piece  it s not long  and consider  what if   with respect to a fading of the Crypto mania  SEMI is in the business of compiling the data and making projections  key word  projections    not analyzing the long term viability of the Cryptos or any other industry driving technology 

The surge of cryptocurrency prices in 2017 created unprecedented demand for crypto mining machines  which nowadays are typically powered by high end GPU and Application Specific Integrated Circuits  ASICs   This sudden rise triggered a shortage of the GPU chips graphic cards typically used for gaming  video processing  machine learning  and other applications 

Okay so  not only do the Bitcoin kids need to hope that the February bounce is real  but what if just maybe Crypto really does have  at any time  What kind of Semi industry projections would go out the window with it 


Vulnerability  2
Very simply  every cycle has its stories  And since the 2008 market liquidation and economic collapse Semiconductors have seemed to benefit from every damned one of them  Well  the 3D Printing promotion excepted  That was a case of good old Wall Street hype and its Armani dressed pitch men finding their way into manufacturing sector analysis  if not the actual shop floor  to the detriment of many  Since we re proving our work in order to validate current opinions  here was  on 3DP well ahead of time  almost exactly 4 years ago  when people had the chance to take their profits and or get out of the way of a coming crash 
But Semiconductors have been key to the iPhone  which came along about a decade ago and took the world by storm  spawning all manner of competitive devices and and ever growing list of tools and applications  Then the  internet of things   another wonderful pitch by the suits  Basically  it means stick a chip in it and have it access the internet and perform functions  Great stuff  but we are talking about growth curves here  Apps  games  cars and whatever else bright minds will think of to interconnect will all be part of it  Communication  Automation  Robotics  etc  have made great strides and are steeped in innovation  I am not trying to discount that  I am simply stating that the laws of economics still hold and one of those laws is cyclical demand vs  supply 
Vulnerability  3
Well  how about the hard data already being gauged by industry watchers  Again  I don t mean the slick guy in the tailored suit who really wants you in and bullish  I mean real industry analysts 
At this time  even assuming the Cryptocurrencies remain per rosy projections and the big hit to that market was simply a shakeout  it is a deceleration in the growth of a still growing industry that we are concerned with  It is not like the business of Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  and Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  are not still healthy  they are  But in a leading edge cyclical industry  it pays to watch growth rates because there is an awful lot of projection and extrapolation coming from those growth rates 
I call the Semi Equipment sector a Chirping Canary for a reason  it s early  potentially very early  So we are looking ahead  not getting scared or hysterical  Just logically using something that indicated positive outcomes in 2013 and 2016 and is a would be gatekeeper to negative outcomes moving forward 
SEMI highlights  and extrapolates growth  Again  it is important to note that these guys do not just make things up  They have real data with which to make these projections  However  they do not have the ultimate answers to the end market drivers  The Semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical for that reason  I myself experienced as a young person how abruptly the cycle can grind to a halt 


Now  maybe it s different this time and I am an old has been  But maybe not 

The World Fab Forecast report  published on December 4  2017  by SEMI  is modeling that fab equipment spending in 2017 will total US 57 billion or 41 percent year over year  YoY  growth  In 2018  spending is expected to shoot up another 11 percent at US 63 billion  The two spending jumps in 2017 and 2018 are contributing to the  WOW  factor and to two consecutive years of record fab investments  Following historic large investments  some slowdown is expected for 2019 

In other words  slowing growth  Worse problems would come if something happens to end market demand that causes revisions to the 2018 projections  Again  I am not trying to promote a Crypto crash or any other terminal event  Just on the weight of its own growth  projections made by Wall Street analysts and a world full of happy idiots playing with the electronics  games  smart cars  homes  this and that  growth is projected to slow into a downshifting of the cycle 
 from November 21st where we first noted the wrong headed media hype headline  about  even bigger winners for 2018   amid slowing growth projections 

Bottom Line
Why it s simple  Just as it proved helpful in January of 2013  against the prevailing bearish views of that post Fiscal Cliff time period  and just as it proved helpful in early mid 2016 against the prevailing bearish views about Brexit and the implications of the global NIRP regime  it is helpful now to keep an open mind against the prevailing attitudes  From January of 2013 it would then seem like forever and a day until the economy would be universally acknowledged as healthy 
So again  let s not get in a bearish uproar  Indeed  my view leans bullish on general stocks after we are clear of the current correction potential  But the Canary may be chirping ",2018-02-20,Gary Tanashian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/semi-bearish-200291891,200291891

144631,366146,LRCX,Forget The CPI  Look At The Hidden  W  Bottom,opinion,"This morning we finally got the dreaded Consumer Price Index  CPI  numbers that everyone who reads financial headlines was gnashing their teeth about all week The CPI rose 0 5  in January versus the expected increase of 0 3   And this is up 2 1  from a year ago  with consumer prices in January rising at the fastest monthly pace in more than five years This is also the fifth consecutive month of year to year prices rising more than 2   Even worse  as Brian S  Wesbury  Chief Economist of First Trust Advisors noted  in the past three months  CPI is up at a 4 4  annual rate  showing clear acceleration above the Fed s 2  target  Wesbury now believes  New Fed Chief Jerome Powell has his work cut out for him  And if you were watching the market reaction at 8 30 ET after the numbers were released  you got a great show and lesson The  show  was the immediate panic where CME S P E mini futures  ES  fell nearly 50 points  or almost 2   in a blood curdling reaction over higher interest rates to come The  lesson  was the quick recovery as cooler heads  who had calculated all this in advance  prevailed and saw that dip as a great buying opportunity And here we are Wednesday before lunch looking at a big fat rally  concentrated in some of the areas you would expect if there were some inflation and interest rate concerns  Technology  Services  and Finance For me and my followers  we like to follow the growth in the Technology sector that won t be affected by inflation or rates this year  That s why we were bigger buyers during last week s correction of Alibaba  NYSE BABA   BABA   Lam Research  LRCX   and NVIDIA  NVDA   We even hung on to Facebook  NASDAQ FB   FB  during the tumult And we even ramped up our exposure at the lows on Friday with the ProShares UltraPro QQQ  TQQQ   the 3X bullish leveraged ETF on the Nasdaq 100  as we saw an approaching double bottom in one of my favorite  hidden indicators   S P futures To find out what else can we learn from S P futures  here s the note I wrote last night for my TAZR Trader members  where we were buyers of Friday s lows   Surveying the BattlefieldOn Monday night I mentioned S P resistance at 2700 and 2760 as big hurdles for the market to deal with There s also a little speed bump to get over near the 2720 25 spot which sees an intersection of  1  the Feb 7 highs    that left a big red wick of eager sellers on the rejection candle    and  2  the 50 day MA So as the fear about our 3 Market Dislocations    falling ex US growth  inflation rates  short VIX  buried bodies     subsides  higher we should go and see what those resistance areas are made of  Speaking of fear  a fair question about the VIX would be     Why does it remain elevated at 25   Here s what I posted on StockTwits  in less than 140 characters  to answer that     VIX 2 things to keep in mind about elevated vol during bounce  1  25 VIX   1 5  daily moves up or down  2  Residual effects of  XIV linger To translate this  the secondary point is a minor nod to the  short VIX  unwind and concern about  buried bodies  yet to be discovered  The primary point is that we are currently still having 1 2  daily S P swings and it doesn t matter that the moves are upward  SPX option market makers still use a daily to weekly range forecast to price their risk in selling puts or buying calls  Those volatility forecasts can be purely quantitative  on one end of the spectrum   or models that blend in more subjectivity  the middle   or even a lot more directional bias  the other end of the spectrum   Wherever these players in the  jungle of risk  exist on the spectrum  the market for pricing risk is living in a higher regime of the rainforest  For now  Alas  fear will slowly subside  as it always does in a bull market with very low probability of recession or systemic risk  And all those who try and draw trend lines on the VIX and wonder if it will explode again are the same ones who didn t buy the lows last week  They are waiting for perfect safety to enter the market again  Pity the fools The Hidden Double  W  Bottom That s Already Providing Bullish StructureFor TAZR  I was slightly on the fence today about putting our last chunk of cash to work on the bullish side of the ledger I had my buying eyes on SPXL  the S P 500 3X Bull ETF  between  40 and  42  But I needed to make that decision quickly before lunch time as the grind higher kept going Basically  I wrestled with the idea    laptop in hand  getting a follow up xray on this stupid leg    whether we should wait for a smaller re test of 2600 I knew the bears were on the run  but I thought we d get one more head fake lower to flush out weak late bulls before we could capitalize on the  Hidden W Bottom  Yes  there is another  hidden indicator  at work in the markets during high volatility that I have used many times before during strong pullbacks in this bull market The hidden indicator that created a  Hidden W Bottom  is the S P futures   ES   overnight pre market price action Astute market players were well aware that the S P E mini futures  ES  had made a lower low than the cash index  SPX  earlier in the week just below 2540 simply because the futures had dropped to those levels in the overnight session on Feb 5 at 11pm ET The SPX cash market never saw those levels with the gap open lower on Feb 6  at 9 30 ET  to 2600 and then the all day surge to 2700 This hidden indicator is often very useful because it tells you where institutions are willing to step in and buy extremely discounted S P exposure between when the NYSE is closed Why would they do this Maybe they are well long and just wanted to place an additional bet to add some quick and easy upside alpha to their limping performance on an expected bounce Maybe they missed the chance to buy puts or sell S P Emini  ES  futures  and hedge their long only risk  but they definitely recognize when a market has gone too far to the downside and their quant models see values everywhere overnight with the S P approaching 2500 Here is a chart of the S P E mini Double  W  Bottom  with those lows occurring on Monday night and Friday afternoon   The message  The bears better be heads up if this scenario is unfolding Followers know that I don t care for hard drawn  trend lines   But the basic idea still holds about where the market wants to gravitate upwards to and where the sellers might be  More importantly  since the market is forging bullish structure  W bottoms  higher lows  threatening higher highs  in a fundamentally favorable environment    after a big panic flush    then the odds are on our side to continue to seek higher levels and new inflection points of bull bear battles  This doesn t mean that large  long only institutions aren t chomping at the bit to sell into the rally and unintentionally create a  hard W  with the SPX cash back below 2600   I say  unintentionally  because large sellers aren t thinking about  bottoms  right now  but only how to preserve capital in case the market crashes further   But it does give us a strong chance to probe above S P 2700 before then  The great thing about our portfolio is that we are so well positioned in key growth stocks  we don t care which way the index moves from here  2  higher or lower tomorrow within the range only lights our fuse for better action and reaction  end of TAZR commentary for 1 13 As I publish this note at 2pm ET  the S P 500 was pushing into its highs for the day above 2695

of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included  A positive percentage 50 day moving average

144729,366244,LRCX,Semi Canary Still Chirping  But He s Gonna Croak in 2018,opinion,"Since January 2013 we have been using the worldwide Semiconductor Equipment industry as a leader within the semiconductor sector  which is an economic cyclical leader itself  That month we noted a positive move in equipment bookings  which became a  3 month  trend that spring  This trend was used to project positive economic signals to come 
Through some turbulence in 2014 and 2015 the sector has remained on  economic up  along with our cross reference indicator  the palladium gold ratio right up to the current time as the economic canary in a coal mine has kept on chirping 
But on November 21  two days before the sector topped I derisively poked at the mainstream media for hyping the Semiconductor Equipment sector with its bold headline  Fund manager looks beyond  FAANG  stocks and finds even bigger winners for 2018  Talk about eyeball harvesting and greed stimulation 
The article highlighted a fund manager who s likely never dirtied his expensive shoes on a factory floor going on about how he has found value in the likes of Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  and Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   I gave a rebuttal per the link above and noted the reasons why this rosy scenario was unlikely to play out in 2018 for the cycle leading Semi sector and its sub sector leader  the Fab equipment companies 
So what do we have now  Why  in checks a real source of industry news  unlike the completely abstracted financial media we as investors are routinely subjected to  with affirmation of our November 21 viewpoint 
To review  in 2013 we projected Semi Equipment   Semi   broader Manufacturing   Employment and it has played out that way over time and through much media drama and noise  But now the pace of a cyclical leader is slowing  even as the world stokes up on reflation  AKA fiscally stimulated inflation  and it all appears as good as it gets 
That is key  In Q4 2012 market players were embroiled in the Fiscal Cliff drama as my brother in law  a financial adviser  told me at Thanksgiving how the best and brightest fund managers were hording cash in expectation of a negative market event coming that December due to said Fiscal Cliff  My grunted response  which to this day I wish I d had  all in  conviction about  was  bullish   That was the sentiment end of it  and the next month saw the Semi signals start coming in  The rest is history 
But January 2018 is much different than January 2013  Meanwhile  here are a few items from the article 

World semiconductor equipment shipment growth was a very robust  26 percent  3 month basis  in October but down from its  63 percent peak in February  By comparison  October global semiconductor shipments were up 22 percent  while November Taiwan chip foundry sales  a leading indicator  were up only 3 percent  Based on Chart 1 it appears the SEMI equipment growth will ease considerably in early 2018 



Comparing global SEMI equipment shipments to the Global Purchasing Managers Index  another leading indicator  also suggests that SEMI Equipment shipment growth will ease but still remain positive into the New Year  Chart 2   SEMI equipment demand remains strong  but the  bubble  growth like we experienced in 2017 is typically followed by a downward  correction   especially since the current buildup in memory chip capacity will likely ebb in 2018 


I recommend you read the rest of the article  It is very short and to the point  The point being that the up cycle on the economic Canary in a Coal Mine is losing momentum and a respected industry source is projecting it to cycle down sharply in 2018  Now  why again did I make fun of the suit who manages other people s money for a living when he got newly bullish on AMAT and LRCX in November 
This signal plays into only everything we are currently working on  An   to get everyone off sides as often happens when the Continuum   reaches its limiter  Right now it s fiscally stimulated inflation and asset prices continuing to rise  But the Canary is going to stop chirping at some point  and then  cue the crickets 

Or for another metaphor  the game of Musical Chairs is going to require you find a seat  While enjoying the current party we are also working on defining the right seats for the hangover phase  Hint  two of them are shiny and made of gold and silver  Hint 2  another digs shiny stuff out of the ground and is counter cyclical ",2018-01-12,Gary Tanashian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/semi-canary-still-chirping-but-hes-gonna-croak-in-2018-200279990,200279990
144730,366245,LRCX,Buy These 5 Price to Book Value Stocks In 2018 For Gains,opinion,Value investors have  over the years  preferred price to earnings ratio or P E as a means to identify value stocks  However  in case of loss making companies that have a negative Price to Earnings ratio  the Price to Sales or P S ratio is considered in determining their true value However  the price to book ratio  P B ratio   though used less often  is also an easy to use valuation tool for identifying low priced stocks with great returns The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market capitalization book value of equityNow let us understand the concept of book value What is Book Value There are several ways by which book value can be defined  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s share price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditures  high debt companies  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should also analyze other ratios like P E  P S  and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect Current

144754,366269,LRCX,Bet On These 5 Low Leverage Stocks To Ensure Safe Returns,opinion,In the world of business finance  leverage refers to an investment strategy that involves borrowing of funds to finance the expansion of the business  purchase of inventory and other assets as well as supporting other aspects of business operations  Now financial leverage is the amount of debt that exists in the capital structure of a company While there exists option for equity financing  historically  debt financing has achieved more popularity among corporations when compared to equity financing  This is because  on availing debt financing  the company s equity does not get diluted as a result of issuing more shares of stock  In other words  the borrower has no claim in the company s shares Yet  debt financing has got its own drawbacks  It tends to shoot up the company s risk of bankruptcy   This is because companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns Nevertheless  this should not discourage one to invest in stocks  Instead  to be on the safe side  investors should measure the extent of financial leverage a company is bearing before putting their hard earned money in its stock And here comes the importance of leverage ratios  which have been constructed historically to safeguard investors from becoming victims of debt trap  Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  to evaluate a company s credit worthiness  for potential equity investments Analyzing Debt to EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio implies that it has a more or less

quarter  Naturally  investors are gearing up to pour money in stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth But in the uncertain world of investment  markets can falter anytime  particularly affecting

144776,366291,LRCX,5 Low Leverage Stocks To Withstand Interest Rate Hikes,opinion,Leverage  in particular financial leverage  is the amount of debt that an entity uses to buy more assets  In corporate finance  debt financing is a well known term  which is used as a tool by companies to ensure smooth business operations  Since companies have limited funds  they need exogenous funding to boost their financial resources from time to time for expansion of operations Even with the option for equity financing  companies prefer borrowing funds as these are easily and cheaply available  Moreover  using financial leverage rather than acquiring more equity capital is favored as equity financing reduces the earnings per share of existing shareholders Yet the word  debt  is unnerving for many   This is because while debt brings with it the capacity to spend a little bit more  it also carries the burden of repayment with additional interest in the future   In fact  the related amount of interest expense may overwhelm the borrower if it does not earn sufficient returns to offset the interest expense  This is a particular problem when interest rates rise or the returns from assets decline Also when theamount of debt a company bears becomes exorbitant  it poses greater risk  In fact  companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt Considering this and the fact that analysts are currently estimating a hike in U S  interest rates at the upcoming Fed meet this month  investors may feel shaky  Nevertheless  this does not indicate that one should totally dissuade from equity investment What investors need now is tochoose stocks prudently  avoiding those with high debt loads  So the crux of safe investment lies in identifying

144778,366293,LRCX,4 Hot Momentum Stocks For Exciting Returns,opinion,When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  Translated  one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift  Thus  this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast moving train  without fretting about valuations or growth prospects  But why does the momentum strategy work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in the prices  On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends  and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is thus based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over a long period of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you benefit from both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which would reflect some profit taking in the stock Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price  52 Weeks    Top  50  This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks  This

this week s article EMCOR Group  Inc    NYSE EME    Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc    NYSE HII    Lam Research Corp    NASDAQ LRCX    SK Telecom Co   Ltd    NYSE SKM   and Landstar System  Inc    NASDAQ LSTR   Bet on These 5 Low Leverage Stocks for Assured ReturnsA company needs exogenous funds for smooth operations  meeting obligations and expanding business  with capital being one of the basic factors of production  Although there is option for equity financing  a comparative analysis of the cost of capital theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity  This is because debt is available at a lower cost compared to equity  especially in periods of low interest rates Interestingly  the U S    the world s richest economy   is the biggest borrower as well  In fact  according to the FY19 Federal Budget  at the end of FY18  gross U S  federal government debt is estimated to be  21 09 trillion  more than double the debt load in the last decade No one voluntarily wishes to be part of a debt ridden nation  This is because debt brings with it the burden of interest payments Then again  this should not dissuade one from investing in U S  stocks  After all  in spite of such high debt levels  the United States remains the largest economy in the world in terms of GDP  representing a quarter share of the global economy per the latest World Bank figures The problem arises when leverage  referred to as the amount of debt a company bears  becomes exorbitant  In particular  companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt Therefore  the need of the hour is to choose stocks prudently  avoiding those with high debt loads  So the crux of safe investment lies in identifying low leverage stocks This is where the significance of financial leverage ratio comes into play  This ratio measures the extent of financial leverage a company bears  Several leverage ratios have been developed for this purpose  with debt to equity ratio being the most popularFor the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research

144834,366349,LRCX,Watch The Usual Suspect  Global Week Ahead,opinion,"In the Global Week Ahead  to find the biggest fundamental catalyst for stock markets  target the usual suspect at the top of a month   the latest U S  non farm payroll report 
On Wednesday  the ADP private payroll report lands  This is a foreshadowing of the preliminary Federal number out on Friday 
What s the backdrop going into the report  Last week s U S  unemployment claims remained low at 238K  A lagging indicator is the U S  household unemployment rate  It rests at 4 1   That s low too 
So Friday s economist consensus sees monthly job additions number at around  200K for November  That s a muddle through call 
Nonetheless  this updated coincident indicator will get studied in great detail 
Perhaps the most closely watched internal numbers become the annual wage growth figures  These are a  tell  on any future pickup in U S  consumer inflation  In turn  that would get the Federal Open Market Committee s full attention 
In the halls of Congress  the U S  is still a fair distance from enacting a tax plan 
The Senate version and House version now go into  conference   In this set of joint meetings  the House and Senate hash out a common agreement to bridge differences  They will re submit a single proposal to both chambers 
This Friday  there is an expiring deadline on funding needed to keep the U S  government open  In other words  a debt ceiling and spending appropriation deadline looms  This opens up a rather small possibility of a government shutdown 
Not to be put on a back burner  the Mueller investigation can surely intensify 
Across the Global Week Ahead  central banks outside the USA will make important policy rate setting decisions 
On Wednesday  in Latin America  consensus expects the Banco Central do Brasil to cut its Selic monetary policy rate by 50 basis points   
Last week  South Korea became the first major Asian central bank since 2014 to hike interest rates 
That was a sign the  great unwinding  of crisis era low interest rates are spreading  Resurgent growth in Europe and the U S  has benefitted Asia 
Who is next  Further south  count on Australia to keep rates on hold this week  Focus instead on whether there is any hint of a possible hike next year 
Reserve Banks in Canada and India also hold monetary policy meetings prior to the U S  payroll report

144835,366350,LRCX,Skechers  Revlon  Rio Tinto  ConocoPhillips And Lam Research Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Dec 5  2017    highlights Skechers   NYSE SKX   as the Bull of the Day and Revlon   NYSE REV   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on the Rio Tinto  LON RIO    NYSE RIO    ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   and Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Back in the 1990s and early 2000s  Skechers were inescapable  Every kid  tween  teen  and young adult seemed to have a pair  but more than that  they all wanted a pair because Skechers were the epitome of cool  it certainly helped that the company had the branding power to have pop stars like Britney Spears in their advertisements Skechers and its D Lites slowly faded into the fashion margins  but like all trends and especially anything from the 90s Adidas  DE ADSGN  Superstars and choker necklaces  anyone   the company s quirky sneakers have made a resurgence Skechers have also been helped by the so called  ugly sneaker  trend that s taken the fashion industry by storm  From Kanye West s  to   the uglier the better  And apparently  the more the shoe looks like a Skechers sneaker  the better  too Strong Third Quarter EarningsLast quarter  the Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock reported third quarter earnings that soared past estimates  causing shares to jump over 35  to a new 52 week high Earnings came in at 59 cents per share  coming in way above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents per share  The company said its profit in Q3 was helped by sales growth in its international wholesale business  its company owned global retail business  and a lower effective tax rate Total revenues grew 16 2  to  1 095 billion  also beating our consensus estimate of  1 065 billion  Skechers saw an impressive 4 4  increase in comparable store sales as well CFO David Weinberg said that  We believe the momentum we are experiencing will continue this year and in the coming year  In the wake of this report  many analysts increased their price targets on the retailer  Wedbush raised its target to  35 from  25 and Cowen and Co  boosted its target to  36 from  35  while Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  increased its target to  31 from  28 50 Growth Estimates Have ImprovedIn addition to this slew of price target increases  Skechers  strong earnings report has certainly helped improve its short term growth estimatesFor its current quarter  the company expects earnings to increase an incredible 225   a testament to the growing popularity of the Skechers brand in addition to how well the company believes it will perform during this holiday season Skechers projects net sales in the fourth quarter to fall in the range of  860 million to  885 million  and diluted earnings per share of  0 09 to  0 14 Earnings estimates for 2018 are also on the rise  jumping to  2 15 per share from  1 97 per share in the last 60 days  Revenues are anticipated to jump about 11 5  in the same time frame Shares are RallyingSKX has had an incredible run these past two or so months  and year to date  the stock is up almost 44  compared to the S P 500 s return of about 16 4   Revlon is one of those names in the beauty industry that nearly everyone has heard of  From the iconic shade  Revlon Red  to its everlasting presence in the beauty aisles at your local CVS or Walgreens  the cosmetics giant has built a unique niche for itself in the industry since its founding in 1932 Today  Revlon manufactures  markets  and sells an extensive array of cosmetics and skin care  fragrances  and personal care products under brand names including Revlon  CND  Elizabeth Arden  Almay  Sinful Colors  and Ultima 2 But brand recognition can only do so much  and the Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock has fallen into hard times as of late Big Third Quarter MissLast quarter  Revlon reported a big loss per share of 38 cents  coming in way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents per share and representing a negative earnings surprise of 192 68  Adjusted net loss for the period was  24 million compared to a gain of  13 million in the prior year period Revenues were  667 million  which actually beat our consensus estimate of  605 million and grew 10 2  on an as reported basis However  gross profit margin fell by over 3 percentage points to 62  of sales thanks to weakness in the core U S  selling market Revlon s international sales of  323 3 million were strong  though  and were a highlight of the report  especially once compared to last year s figure of  250 3 million  While our financial performance and sales results in the U S  remained soft in a challenging retail environment   CEO Fabian Garcia said   we are encouraged by the global growth of our iconic Revlon and Elizabeth Arden brands  and  our international sales which remain robust  Earnings in DeclineRevlon s bottom line is in a perpetual slump at the moment  and this decline doesn t seem to be going away any time soon For the current quarter  Zacks expects the company to see its earnings decrease over 80   with sales slumping just over 7  during the same time frame The rest of fiscal 2017 doesn t look too bright either  earnings are projected to tumble in the triple digits from the prior year  and the Zacks Consensus now sits at   1 96  down from   1 11 just 60 days ago Shares Down on the YearShares of Revlon have fallen nearly 24  year to date compared to the S

144868,366383,LRCX,Bet On These 5 Low Leverage Stocks For Assured Returns,opinion,"A company needs exogenous funds for smooth operations  meeting obligations and expanding business  with capital being one of the basic factors of production  Although there is option for equity financing  a comparative analysis of the cost of capital theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity  This is because debt is available at a lower cost compared to equity  especially in periods of low interest rates 
Interestingly  the U S    the world s richest economy   is the biggest borrower as well  In fact  according to the FY19 Federal Budget  at the end of FY18  gross U S  federal government debt is estimated to be  21 09 trillion  more than double the debt load in the last decade 
No one voluntarily wishes to be part of a debt ridden nation  This is because debt brings with it the burden of interest payments 
Then again  this should not dissuade one from investing in U S  stocks  After all  in spite of such high debt levels  the United States remains the largest economy in the world in terms of GDP  representing a quarter share of the global economy per the latest World Bank figures 
The problem arises when leverage  referred to as the amount of debt a company bears  becomes exorbitant  In particular  companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt 
Therefore  the need of the hour is to choose stocks prudently  avoiding those with high debt loads  So the crux of safe investment lies in identifying low leverage stocks 
This is where the significance of financial leverage ratio comes into play  This ratio measures the extent of financial leverage a company bears  Several leverage ratios have been developed for this purpose  with debt to equity ratio being the most popular
Analyzing Debt to Equity
Debt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  Equity
This metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business  thereby making it a better investment pick 
With the Q3 reporting cycle well behind us  companies that recorded higher earnings growth will attract investors on probabilities of outperformance in Q4 as well  But if such companies bear high leverage  they might not generate satisfactory returns  This is because during economic depressions  debt ridden companies are prone to falling into a debt trap 
The Winning Strategy
Considering the aforementioned factors  it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure safe returns 
However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors 
Here are the other parameters 
Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers 
Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 
Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation 
Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation 
Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success 
 Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 
Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 20 stocks that made it through the screen 
EMCOR Group  Inc    NYSE EME    This corporation is engaged in design  integration  installation  start up  testing  operation and maintenance of complex mechanical and electrical systems  It pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 16 96  in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank  1 
Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc    NYSE HII    The company designs  builds and maintains nuclear and non nuclear ships for the U S  Navy and Coast Guard and provides after market services for military ships around the globe  It carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 14 22  in the trailing four quarters 
Lam Research Corp    NASDAQ LRCX    It provides market leading equipment and services for semiconductor wafer processing  It pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 5 33  in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  
SK Telecom Co   Ltd    NYSE SKM    It is the provider of world s first commercial CDMA digital cellular service  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 and boasts a long term earnings growth rate of 7 7  
Landstar System  Inc    NASDAQ LSTR    It is a provider of integrated transportation management solutions worldwide  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 4 97  in the trailing four quarters

144869,366384,LRCX,4 Low Price to Book Value Stocks To Tap Market Boom,opinion,Given the recent runup  value analysis is increasingly gaining prominence in identifying stocks at great values  Price to earnings  P E  and price to sales  P S  are the first ratios to hit an investor s mind while looking for undervalued stocks  However  the underrated price to book ratio  P B ratio  is also an easy to use valuation tool for identifying low priced stocks with exceptional returns The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market capitalization book value of equityWhat is Book ValueThere are several ways by which book value can be defined  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value Explaining the P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s share price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditures  high debt companies  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should also analyze other ratios like P E  P S  and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  equal to A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer

144901,366416,LRCX,Buy These 5 Value Picks As Wall Street Braces For A Dip,opinion,U S  stocks managed to arrest a two day slide on Monday  even managing to close the session with meager gains  Though Monday s gains came on the back of encouraging deal news  investors will continue to wait for further progress on the new tax policy However  experts believe that the likelihood of such reforms being implemented within this year is extremely unlikely  Further  the era of low interest rates which had fueled much of the markets  gains is coming to an end worldwide with central banks rolling back their easy money policies Given this background  constant warnings about the exorbitant valuations of U S  stocks may not seem as unrealistic as they did before  Some of these are rather bleak  going so far as to predict a decade long period of losses  However  the uncertainty created by the hurdles to the tax reform process and upcoming rate hikes means that it would make for a smart move to shore up your portfolios with some great value stock picks Investors Remain Uneasy About Tax Cut ProspectsThe first weekly decline in two months was triggered on Nov 9 by the introduction of the Senate Republicans  version of a tax cut legislation that entails the deferment of corporate tax cuts for a year  Such a delay raised concerns about President Trump s ability to pass laws  leading the Dow to snap a seven session streak of gains which itself was a product of tax cut hopes Of course  the market does have other catalysts and Monday s gains came on the back of encouraging deal news  But investors will continue to await further progress on the new tax policy  However  experts believe that the likelihood of such reforms being implemented within this year is extremely unlikely Further  the version of the legislation introduced by the Senate Republicans is widely different from the one introduced in the House  This is likely to lead to several rounds of negotiations which in turn would raise market volatility  Central Banks Prepare to Wind down StimulusAn end to the monetary stimulus packages which central banks across the world have put in place is another factor which will soon come into play  Markets have been boosted by an extended phase of soft interest rates over several years now and their gradual removal can only reduce the level of impetus they enjoy  While the Fed prepares to raise rates in December  the ECB will begin slashing the level of its bond purchases from this month One section of market watchers believe that U S  investors have already come to terms with such a move  But given the events of the past week  a rate hike at this time could make things tougher for stocks  The Fed and the ECB are only likely to tighten monetary conditions further going ahead  which makes it imperative for investors to choose their stocks carefully U S  Valuations Already at Record LevelOver the last few months  investors have received several warnings about the pricey nature of U S  stocks  The latest of these comes from John Hussman who claims that valuations for U S  stocks have already hit an all time high  Using his valuation metric of choice  the ratio of market capitalization to gross value added  Grossman claims that stocks are pricier than they were in 2000 and 1929  years which heralded unprecedented market downturns Hussman believes that overstretched valuations  caused by an almost 300  Bull Run  will lead to a market drop of almost 63   This would then lead to an entire decade of losses for the bourses  The underlying reason for the crash would be the prevailing belief among investors that only risky assets can provide good returns Such a feeling has become popular during an extended period of extremely low interest rates  thinks Hussman  While most market watchers would characterize such dire conclusions as a tad extreme  they would be hard put to dismiss them outright  given the events dampening investor sentiment in the recent past Our ChoicesConcerns about the ability of the Trump administration to push through tax cuts have been weighing on stocks recently  Even though markets have edged up during the last trading session  such fears are likely to dampen investor sentiment going forward Further  central banks across the world are preparing to wind down monetary stimulus measures  Given such a backdrop it makes sense to bet on value stocks to protect your hard earned profits  Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Value Score and Zacks Rank We narrowed down our choices with the help of our new S Our

NASDAQ KELYA    Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX   and ZAGG  Inc    NASDAQ ZAGG   Screen of the Week by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research New Highs for the  New Highs  Stock Picking StrategyWith the market having made all time highs  I thought I d celebrate those record events by showcasing our  New Highs  strategy  which is also making new highs   YTD thru 5 12 17  it s up 28 1  vs  the S P s 7 7   This screen focuses on a powerful concept  and that s buying stocks making new highs If somebody were to ask you what your best stocks are  you would likely name the stocks moving up the most in your portfolio  Your worst stocks  The ones going lower  of course Simply put  the winners in your portfolio are the ones going up  Period If the stock is underperforming the market  or worse  going down   you ll quickly identify it as one of your worst holdings    and you would be right to do so This being the case  it only makes sense that some of these will be making new highs along the way Don t Be Afraid of New HighsI know some are reluctant to buy stocks making new 52 week highs  But there s no reason to be  I suppose some may feel like they ve already missed it  Or that now it has more room to fall  But if a stock is making a new 52 week high  that s a  good thing   Just like a stock making a new 52 week low is a  bad thing  And I m pretty sure the person who dislikes buying stocks making new 52 week highs wouldn t be too upset if the stock he already owned  broke out to a new 52 week high  And why should he  As I ve mentioned before  statistics have shown that stocks making new highs have a tendency of making even higher highs  These are the stocks we all dream about  Getting in and watching it go up Of course  the fundamentals need to be there  And you should keep a watchful eye on valuations  But if you were in a stock making new highs and cheering it on  it seems silly to be afraid of one doing the same just because you haven t bought it yet One question I like asking myself just to put things into perspective is  If I was in it  would I be excited and would I still want to be in it  If the answer is  yes     then I ll look for the best opportunity to get in  If the answer is  no  I would be looking to take profits     then I ll move on Embrace Stocks Making New HighsThis topic reminds me of a question someone asked me a while ago about a stock I was talking about that was at a new 52 week high  In fact  it was at a new 5 year high He said   Aren t you worried about buying a stock at a 52 week high   I said of course not  So it just made a new 52 week high  That s great news  Guess what    last year it made a new 52 week high as well  And the year before that  And the year before that  Can you imagine all the money you d be leaving on the table if you were afraid of being in stocks every time they made a new high And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the

144904,366419,LRCX,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  American Axle   Manufacturing Holdings  Vishay Intertechnology  SMART Global Holdings  United Rentals And Lam Research,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 15  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include American Axle   Manufacturing Holdings  Inc    NYSE AXL    Vishay Intertechnology  Inc    NYSE VSH    SMART Global Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ SGH    United Rentals  Inc    NYSE URI   and Lam Research Corp    NASDAQ LRCX   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  Buy These 5 Value Picks as Wall Street Braces for a Dip U S  stocks managed to arrest a two day slide on Monday  even managing to close the session with meager gains  Though Monday s gains came on the back of encouraging deal news  investors will continue to wait for further progress on the new tax policy However  experts believe that the likelihood of such reforms being implemented within this year is extremely unlikely  Further  the era of low interest rates which had fueled much of the markets  gains is coming to an end worldwide with central banks rolling back their easy money policies Given this background  constant warnings about the exorbitant valuations of U S  stocks may not seem as unrealistic as they did before  Some of these are rather bleak  going so far as to predict a decade long period of losses  However  the uncertainty created by the hurdles to the tax reform process and upcoming rate hikes means that it would make for a smart move to shore up your portfolios with some great value stock picks Investors Remain Uneasy About Tax Cut ProspectsThe first weekly decline in two months was triggered on Nov 9 by the introduction of the Senate Republicans  version of a tax cut legislation that entails the deferment of corporate tax cuts for a year  Such a delay raised concerns about President Trump s ability to pass laws  leading the Dow to snap a seven session streak of gains which itself was a product of tax cut hopes Of course  the market does have other catalysts and Monday s gains came on the back of encouraging deal news  But investors will continue to await further progress on the new tax policy  However  experts believe that the likelihood of such reforms being implemented within this year is extremely unlikely Further  the version of the legislation introduced by the Senate Republicans is widely different from the one introduced in the House  This is likely to lead to several rounds of negotiations which in turn would raise market volatility Central Banks Prepare to Wind down StimulusAn end to the monetary stimulus packages which central banks across the world have put in place is another factor which will soon come into play  Markets have been boosted by an extended phase of soft interest rates over several years now and their gradual removal can only reduce the level of impetus they enjoy  While the Fed prepares to raise rates in December  the ECB will begin slashing the level of its bond purchases from this month One section of market watchers believe that U S  investors have already come to terms with such a move  But given the events of the past week  a rate hike at this time could make things tougher for stocks  The Fed and the ECB are only likely to tighten monetary conditions further going ahead  which makes it imperative for investors to choose their stocks carefully U S  Valuations Already at Record LevelOver the last few months  investors have received several warnings about the pricey nature of U S  stocks  The latest of these comes from John Hussman who claims that valuations for U S  stocks have already hit an all time high  Using his valuation metric of choice  the ratio of market capitalization to gross value added  Grossman claims that stocks are pricier than they were in 2000 and 1929  years which heralded unprecedented market downturns Hussman believes that overstretched valuations  caused by an almost 300  Bull Run  will lead to a market drop of almost 63   This would then lead to an entire decade of losses for the bourses  The underlying reason for the crash would be the prevailing belief among investors that only risky assets can provide good returns Such a feeling has become popular during an extended period of extremely low interest rates  thinks Hussman  While most market watchers would characterize such dire conclusions as a tad extreme  they would be hard put to dismiss them outright  given the events dampening investor sentiment in the recent past Our ChoicesConcerns about the ability of the Trump administration to push through tax cuts have been weighing on stocks recently  Even though markets have edged up during the last trading session  such fears are likely to dampen investor sentiment going forward Further  central banks across the world are preparing to wind down monetary stimulus measures  Given such a backdrop it makes sense to bet on value stocks to protect your hard earned profits  Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Value Score and Zacks Rank We narrowed down our choices with the help of our new S Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  offer the best investment opportunities in the value investing space  You can see

144964,366479,LRCX,S P 500 Futures  Typical Price Action  Gap Up  Dump And Rally ,opinion,"With the index markets up so much in 2017  the most recent pattern of selling the gap up opens  or the first rally above the gap  has worked very well over the last few months  Despite the overall low volumes of the U S  index futures markets  the best trade of the day has been selling the ES when it opens higher on the 8 30 CT futures open  Part of the reason for this is how all the buying power is used up before the open  leaving the ES susceptible to early morning sell offs  Then  the sellers come in and push the futures down  and in come some small sell programs 
No Harm  No Foul
At 1 00pm CT  and after opening at the 2556 00  the ES rallied up to another new all time contract high at 2557 75  After that  it sold off and  triple bottomed  at the 2552 00 level  and then rallied back up to 2554 75  one tick above the vwap  After failing at the vwap  the ES sold back off down to 2550 75  and then rallied back up to 2554 50  two ticks above the vwap  before selling back off down to 2552 75  With the exception of the early selloff  the ES traded in a 5 handle range for most of the day 
Despite the early MiM   put link in for MiM  showing over  600 million  the Nasdaq 100 futures  NQZ17 CME  held tough just before  and just after  2 00pm CT  Total volume at 2 10 CT was only 580 000  with 90 000 of that coming from Globex pre 8 30 open  that means only 470 000 ES have traded in 5 hours and 40 minutes  We understand Mondays start out the week slow  but I just do not remember an extended period like this where the ranges and volumes are so small 
While the MiM went to  800 million for sale  the NQ kept ripping higher  At 2 43 it traded 6116 25  up  17 25 points  and the ES traded 2555 25  up  2 75 handles on the day  The MiM  flipped  just before the 2 45 official NYSE Closing Imbalance came out showing  NET Sell   68 M   10 16 2017 14 45 CT 
In the end the S P 500 futures  ESZ17 CME  settled at 2556 25  up  3 50 handles  or  0 13   the Dow Jones futures  YMZ17 CBT  settled at 22898  up  68 points  or  0 29   the Nasdaq 100 futures  NQZ17 CME  settled at 6120 25  up  20 50 points  or  0 33   and the Russell 2000  RTYZ17 CME  settled at 1505 40  down  0 90 points or  0 05  on the day

 ES Back And Fill Until The Spill
Our View  If you are scratching out a few bucks trading the ES  then you are doing pretty good  Being a trader over the last few months has not been easy  That said  there are a lot of 3rd quarter earnings out this week  and with some very big names reporting  we could see a pick up in trade activity 
Today J J  Goldman and Morgan Stanley report earnings before the bell  As I have been saying  picking tops is a very hard thing to do right now  and while I have been calling for 22548 00 to 2550 00  it s quite possible the ES goes all the way up to 2580 00 to 2600 00  Not today or next week  but over the long haul 
Our view was right on yesterday  and today s view is going to be the same  you can sell the gap up opens or the first 2 3 handle rally above the gap  or you can just wait and buy the pullback  What s hard about this is that most of the rallies happen late in the day  so patience is a virtue

the numbers inflated  That s why sales should always be considered Accomplishing sales growth is extremely challenging in today s multifaceted and fast changing business environment  So  the companies have stepped up marketing initiatives over digital platforms and have become more professional about sales management to drive their top line Also  sales growth is an important metric for any company as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision making  Unsurprisingly  sales growth gets more attention from investors in the investment process  as a healthy sales growth rate is usually a positive investment indicator However  sales growth in isolation doesn t reveal too much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number does not necessarily translate into profits Therefore  consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market

Lam Research stock is beating the market  and it reports earnings soon  But does that make it a good buy today  To answer this question  we ve turned to the Investment U Stock Grader  Our Research Team built this system to diagnose the financial health of a company 
Our system looks at six key metrics 
  Earnings per Share   EPS  Growth  Lam Research reported a recent EPS growth rate of 100 62   That s below the semiconductor industry average of 183 79   That s not a good sign  We like to see companies that have higher earnings growth 
  Price to Earnings   P E   The average price to earnings ratio of the semiconductor industry is 44 53  And Lam Research s ratio comes in at 20  It s trading at a better value than many of its competitors 
  Debt to Equity  The debt to equity ratio for Lam Research stock is 42   That s below the semiconductor industry average of 55 02   The company is less leveraged 
  Free Cash Flow per Share Growth  Lam Research s FCF has been lower than that of its competitors over the last year  That s not good for investors  In general  if a company is growing its FCF  it will be able to pay down debt  buy back stock  pay out more in dividends and or invest money back into the business to help boost growth  It s one of our most important fundamental factors 
  Profit Margins  The profit margin of Lam Research comes in at 22 45  today  And generally  the higher  the better  We also like to see this margin above that of its competitors  Lam Research s profit margin is above the semiconductor average of 15 99   So that s a positive indicator for investors 
  Return on Equity  Return on equity tells us how much profit a company produces with the money shareholders invest  The ROE for Lam Research is 26 71   and that s above its industry average ROE of 16 45

145022,366537,LRCX,Buy These 5 Stocks With Impressive Price to Book Value ,opinion,"While price to earnings and price to sales are the first to cross one s mind while using valuation metrics  the price to book ratio  P B ratio  is also a convenient valuation metric The P B ratio measures how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock  It determines whether a company s asset value is comparable to the stock s market price or not and hence can be useful for finding value stocksP B ratio   market capitalization book value of equity Understanding Book ValueBook value is usually denoted on a company s balance sheet as  stockholder equity There are several ways by which book value can be defined   It is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this will equate to common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value Explaining the P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s share price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditures  high debt companies  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should also analyze other ratios like P E  P S  and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a

This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor Many a times  such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers  Meanwhile  news pertaining to robust sales  surging profit levels  bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive stocks However  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52 week high bar  Wall

of  281  295 million  primarily owing to higher variable compensation As a percentage of revenues  operating expenses declined 60 bps from the year ago quarter but increased 240 bps from the previous

285  299 million For 2017  On Semi now expects free cash flow in the range of  600  650 million  up from the prior guidance of  500  600 million ConclusionWe believe that improving end markets are positive for ON Semi  The Fairchild acquisition has helped the company to secure a dominant position in the power semiconductor market with a planned focus on smartphone  automotive and industrial end markets Further  a diversified customer and product base coupled with improving end markets has insulated the company against certain end market and geographical demand volatility  Lower customer and product concentration risk is therefore a positive for its top line Moreover  growing demand and greater adoption of CMOS image sensor business and ADAS related applications have given ON Semi a significant growth opportunity in the automotive market Additionally  higher synergies from the Fairchild acquisition along with reducing enterprise wide manufacturing cost will boost profitability

5 Stocks Near 52 Week Highs to Buy Right Now

	Over the past few decades  the investment vehicles and strategies available to investors have increased drastically  Admittedly  devising the right strategy from the extensive pool of information to compound portfolio returns might prove to be quite a daunting task  for both seasoned and relatively new investors 

	To make things easier  rely on our tried and tested investment screens  which club the most meaningful parameters to help you rake in solid returns  Here  we discuss one of the relatively new investment techniques  that is betting on stocks near a 52 week high 

	The 52 week investment strategy relies on the new investment mantra   buy high and sell higher   A wide group of investors are placing their bets on stocks which are hovering around their 52 week high mark 

	However  this touch and go strategy should not be followed blindly without a fool proof plan  Rely on our screener to stop chasing fads blindly  Let s take a look at how you could club these stocks with the right set of parameters to turn the tide in your favor 

A Peek in to 52 Week High Stocks

	Stocks near 52 week highs often instill the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  in the minds of investors  This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor 

	Many a times  such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending 

	A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers  Meanwhile  news pertaining to robust sales  surging profit levels  bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher 

	However  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52 week high bar  Wall Street s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it 

	Also  recent academic research reveals that if a stock s current price is near its 52 week high  there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period  According to researchers George and Hwang  holding 52 week high stocks for six months resulted in an average monthly gain of 0 45  between 1963 and 2001  Encouragingly  this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum based strategies 

Setting the Right Filters

	Our diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52 week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries  The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations  sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum 

	These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales  which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time 

Current Price 52 Week High     80

	This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week high mark soon 

  Change Price   4 Weeks   5

	It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks 

  Change Price   12 Weeks   5

	This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well 

Price Sales    XIndMed

	The lower  the better 

P E using F 1  Estimate    XIndMed

	This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings  It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers 

One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0     XIndMed

	This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism 

Zacks Rank   1

	No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank  which has proved its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market  You can see     

Current Price    5

	This parameter will help screen stocks which are trading at  5 or higher 

Volume   20 days  shares     100000

	Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares that can be traded easily 

	Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen 

Weight Watchers International  Inc    NYSE       offers a broad range of weight control programs  The company offers scientifically designed programs  including group support and information on healthy eating patterns  behavior modification and physical activity  With three beats over the trailing four quarters  the company has a positive average surprise of 24 3  

	Headquartered in Hayward  CA  Ultra Clean Holdings  Inc   NASDAQ       is a developer and supplier of critical subsystems for semiconductor capital equipment  consumer  medical  energy  industrial  flat panel  and research industries  The company has an average positive surprise of 28 0  for the trailing four quarters  with back to back beats

145243,366758,LRCX,Ride These 4 Momentum Picks For Impressive Returns,opinion,When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  Translated  one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift  Thus  this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast moving train  without fretting about valuations or growth prospects  But why does the momentum strategy work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in the prices  On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends  and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is thus based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over a long period of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you benefit from both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which would reflect some profit taking in the stock Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price  52 Weeks    Top  50  This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks  This parameter ensures we get stocks that have appreciated the maximum over the past one year Percentage Change in Price  1 Week    Bottom  10  From the above 50 stocks  we then choose those

history of outperformance  You can see  Momentum  of B or better  A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers  It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success  Stocks with a Momentum Style Score of  A  or  B   when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2  Buy  handily outperform other stocks Current Price greater than 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 Market Capitalization

	When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  Translated  one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time 

	At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift  Thus  this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast moving train  without fretting about valuations or growth prospects  But why does the momentum strategy work 

	There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans 

	There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in the prices  On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early 

	Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions 

	These behavioral problems extend trends  and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future 

	Momentum investing is thus based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again 

	Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over a long period of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play 

	Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you benefit from both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which would reflect some profit taking in the stock

145245,366760,LRCX,The Best Way To Profit From The Semiconductor Industry,opinion,"Ignore the hyperbole surrounding tech s demise 
One corner of the market boasts untapped potential 
Four letter ticker symbol included below 
Tech Tantrum  Tech Wreck  Tech Tank 
If you follow stocks  you ve seen one or more of these clever terms to describe the steep sell off in technology names last week 
To be sure  Technology Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLK   the exchange traded fund that tracks large cap tech   fell 2 5  two Fridays ago 
That s the fund s second largest one day drop of the year 
Yes  enthusiasm for tech stocks is palpable 
But as senior analyst Jonathan Rodriguez points out below  there s a good reason for it  And he ll reveal one of the sector s biggest bargains 
Ahead of the tape 
Be Not Afraid  Be Greedy
Man  you can really cut through the market s fear with a knife 
Between the Trump administration  the pending divorce of the United Kingdom from the European Union and China s growth by debt expansion 
There s a lot on the minds of investors these days 
Flip on the tube and the talking heads are fueling the fire with contradicting bullish and bearish takes 
Yes  valuations are high and stocks will correct at some point  Heck  we may even see a bear market in equities in the next few years 
But make no mistake  as long as corporate earnings are rising and interest rates are low  this market will continue to rally 
And the sector leading the charge for U S  stocks by far is   you guessed it   tech 
In the first quarter of 2017  84  of large cap tech firms beat second quarter analyst earnings estimates  according to FactSet 
That s nine percentage points higher than the S P 500  75    and a larger beat rate than any other sector 
It gets better 
FactSet also notes that earnings for the semiconductor industry are expected to grow by 40  in the second quarter 
As you know  semiconductors are at the heart of every electronic device on the planet 
And with 2 5 billion devices expected to ship worldwide next year   up 6  from 2015  according to Gartner   the  34 billion semi industry isn t slowing down anytime soon 
However  semiconductor names aren t cheap by any means 
The benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is currently trading at 29 times trailing earnings   a 55  premium to the Nasdaq Composite Index 
But I ve got a way to play incredible upside in chips without the hefty surcharge 
The Cheat Code to Play Chips Cheap
Ichor Holdings Ltd  NASDAQ ICHR  is a California based semiconductor services company 
And this tiny industrial firm   boasting a market capitalization of just  613 million   is one of tech s biggest hidden bargains 
Ichor specializes in fluid delivery subsystems for semiconductor capital equipment 
I know that s a mouthful  So let me break it down for you 
The semiconductor capital equipment industry builds the machines that companies use to produce chips 
Ichor specializes in the systems that companies use to precisely deliver the chemical fluids needed to build semiconductors 
Some of their customers include Applied Materials Inc  NASDAQ AMAT   and Lam Research Corp  NASDAQ LRCX     two of America s largest chipmakers 
Sales have exploded over the last three years  The company booked revenue of  405 7 million in 2016   a 40  increase from the previous year 
And after two years of posted losses in 2014 and 2015  the company swung to a profit last year of  3 66 per share 
Analysts expect sales to rise this year to  576 million   a rise of 42   and three times the growth of the industry  14 4   
Fiscal 2017 earnings are also expected to grow 56    from  1 32 to  2 05   compared with the industry s 36  growth rate 
Despite Ichor s phenomenal growth  however  the company trades at a mere 10 times forward earnings   well below the industry average  35 5  
The company also trades at 0 8 enterprise value to sales  That s less than half the industry multiple  1 9x  
Bottom line  Fueled by strong earnings growth  the uptrend in tech is far from dead  And the bargain priced Ichor allows investors to capture the juicy upside in semiconductors without taking on the premium valuation in chip stocks 
On the hunt ",2017-06-21,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-best-way-to-profit-from-the-semiconductor-industry-200196485,200196485
145246,366761,LRCX,2 Step Method For Whipping The Bull,opinion,"One of the great mysteries on Wall Street is how to value stocks so you know what to pay for their future earnings 
Since the S P 500 index has traded at an average historical P E  price to earnings ratio  of around 15 times  many investors use that gauge to tell them if a stock is  cheap  or  expensive  
But this one size fits all measure is not how top investors beat the bull because different sectors  let alone many dozens of industries  each have their own unique and subjective  rules  about valuation 
So what s the solution to this complicated mystery  It s really very simple and I have condensed it into 2 easy to follow steps for you 
Step 1  Ignore P E and Focus on Earnings Momentum
In 1979  a paper by MIT Ph D  Len Zacks published in the Financial Analysts Journal revolutionized the way institutional money managers would learn to select stocks 
His research proved that the most powerful force impacting stock prices were the earnings estimate revisions  EER  from Wall Street equity analysts 
He turned this revelation into a quantitative model that was deployed on Wall Street as the Zacks Rank in 1988  For nearly three decades  the model has proven itself to deliver verified market beating returns  validating its robust design over many economic cycles 
And ranking the relative changes in EER has also become the preferred method of smart portfolio managers and investment banks around the globe  even though they often give it their own name and design tweaks 
An Elegant  Yet Simple Model
I ll spare you the differential equations and tell you the two most important parts of the Zacks Rank  Agreement and Magnitude 
Each day  the model gathers all the EPS estimate changes  EER  from investment banks and brokers and crunches them in an algorithm that sorts out the level of Agreement among the analysts and the Magnitude of their revisions 
And at the risk of oversimplifying my boss s grand design  I call this a momentum or  rate of change  model because it grabs the data we most want to know  how big are the earnings estimate moves and how many analysts are  voting  for this change 
We also know the direction of the biggest Agreement and Magnitude moves by virtue of where a stock falls in the Zacks Rank distribution  with big positive changes getting the  1 Strong Buy label and big negative changes earning the  5 Strong Sell tattoo 
That s how  the Rank  simplifies the mystery of picking growth stocks  Just focus on the EPS  momo  
More      
                                                                                                      

The Zacks Rank  1 stocks have averaged an incredible gain of  25  per year  Our researchers uncovered a way to add even more thrust and precision timing to our renowned system 
It boosts fundamentals based methodology with pinpoint technical analysis  You get greater timeliness  accuracy  and profit potential  Also greater focus because it culls down Zacks  880 best stocks to a manageable 8 to 12 
Look into it by Sunday  June 25 and you can also download our brand new Special Report  5 Stocks Set to Double 

                                                                                                      
Step 2  Harness Technical Timing to Multiply Your Edge
After I run my weekly screens for top ranked companies in multiple industries  I put those 30 to 40 stocks through another set of filters that looks at their chart patterns  price momentum  volume trends and other technical criteria I value 
It s how I picked FireEye in March after it made a significant bottom near  10 following a 2 year slide from  50 
Or how I decided to  load the boat  with shares of Alibaba  NYSE BABA  in January and February near  100 when everyone was saying  stay away from China   especially Chinese internet stocks  
And it was why I grabbed NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  and Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  when most investors were afraid to touch these high flying chip stocks because they were already trading above most Wall Street price targets 
Buying fundamentally strong stocks is great  but if you can buy them with an extra  edge  at the bottom of a channel  in the middle of a consolidation that s  waiting to go higher   or on the volume breakout that coincides with an earnings  momo  catalyst  you can multiply your portfolio performance by a generous factor over the long run 
The One Two Punch of the Zacks Rank   Technical Analysis
Not too long ago  I was primarily a technical trader struggling to learn better equity analysis methods that worked consistently without spending thousands of dollars every month on multiple systems that all seemed to contradict each other 
And I was looking for a systematic yet simple way to quantify and qualify thousands of stocks by their fundamentals that didn t take me 20 hours a week either  With so many variables and metrics  I was often overwhelmed by the unlimited ways you could evaluate a company and its potential 
Then  in 2011 I found the Zacks Rank  I was thrilled at how it sliced through the chaos with a single metric that made the most powerful difference in stock returns  earnings momentum 
Plus  the model was designed to capture the heart of big stock moves that happen in between quarterly reports  which made it perfect for 1 3 month swing trading 
When I combined this fundamental  power tool  with my love for  finding money in the charts   I was amazed at the results  By trusting the Rank to do most of the heavy lifting in my fundamental analysis  I could look at more companies across more industries with complete confidence that the odds were stacked in my favor 
It didn t mean every trade would work out  It just meant that most of them would and the gains would far outweigh the losses  That has proven to be the case and I can t imagine trading stocks any other way 
I am directing a  best of both worlds  portfolio service called  Our goal is to target quick double digit wins  roll the profits into the next trade  and let the power of compounded gains work in our favor 
TAZR filters the 880 Zacks Rank  1 and  2 stocks down to an easily managed 8 12 picks with charts too good to ignore  Recently  we ve enjoyed gains as high as 28 8  in just 6 weeks

145247,366762,LRCX,The Week Ahead  Is This Seinfeld Market Just More Of The Same In 2H17 ,opinion,"Trading desks will be closer to normal staffing  Chair Yellen s biannual Congressional testimony will be a feature on Wednesday and Thursday  but the economic calendar is light  With little going on  the punditry will be wondering 
What should we expect for the rest of 2017 
Last Week Recap
The big economic news last week featured employment   as expected  The start of the G20 meetings and North Korean missile tests grabbed some headlines  but without much effect on stocks 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  of the S P 500 from Doug Short via Jill Mislinski  Despite the Thursday selling  the result for the week was essentially unchanged  up 0 07    Not much in the way of fireworks 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read the entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective  including the size and frequency of drawdowns 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The economic news last week was good  
The Good
ISM Manufacturing registered 57 8  both an increase and a beat of expectations  The ISM notes that this level  if annualized  corresponds to a GDP increase of 4 6  and the figures for the YTD suggest a gain of 4 1    I think it is time for them to update their regression model   To provide some color  let s look at the comments they cite 
 Overall  business is strong  We are seeing price increases for packaging and handling materials as well as some MRO supplies   Plastics   Rubber Products 


 Overall  demand is up 5 7 percent and expected to continue through the end of the year  at least     Transportation Equipment 


 Demand is picking up  meeting budget expectations    Electrical Equipment  Appliances   Components 


 Business is still very robust  Have continued to hire to match increased demand    Computer   Electronic Products 


 Business  is  steady  not great  but good and fairly solid    Furniture   Related Products 


 Business globally continues to show improvement    Chemical Products 


 Environmental regulations have strong effects on our business  We continue to watch for any changes as a result of the new administration    Paper Products 


 Dry weather helping demand    Nonmetallic Mineral Products 


 International business outside North America on the upswing    Machinery 


 Metal pricing continues to drag down our profit margins  but we are very busy quoting new business  so our customers have a good outlook on the rest of the year    Fabricated Metal Products 


 Business is strong both domestically and internationally  Supplier deliveries are quick domestically  international supply chain is slowing  We are in a hiring mode    Food  Beverage   Tobacco Products 


Q2 Earnings are off to a good start  Only 7  of companies have reported so far  but  the strong comparisons 
ISM Services both increased and beat expectations with a reading of 57 4  Jill Mislinski digs into the data with useful details  Here is a key chart 

Employment   Establishment Survey beat expectations  The gain of 222K net jobs handily beat expectations and the prior two months were revised higher  Calculated Risk calls it a  solid report   Check out  and charts  Instead of charts from the NYT or WSJ and opinions from sell side researchers  I suggest something different this month  The BLS has an  where you can look at various questions and zoom in for details  It is educational and fun  at least for data wonks   Since I believe that people take this report too seriously  I would like to emphasize the sampling error  This is not something that disappears after two revisions  although the benchmark revisions finally fix it   People react to this news because it is important  not because it is really accurate  The sampling error is better after a time  but by then no one cares 



The Bad
Hotel occupancy has turned lower     
Factory Orders declined 0 8   slightly worse than expectations of  0 7      
Employment   Household Survey  Many observers jumped on the sluggish nominal growth in the hourly wage    who writes an excellent and comprehensive employment analysis each month  subscription only   gave the Household Survey a  high D   The main reason was that more people are unemployed  It is not terrible  and only one month  but something to watch 

Bob s analysis  unbiased and representing quality you will not see elsewhere  focuses our attention on when and if business confidence will start to show up in the numbers  You see this only via a deep study of the components 
The ADP report  which I regard as a solid independent measure  disappointed with an estimate of a net gain of only 158K private jobs 
The Ugly
Russians are now suspects in the hacking of nuclear sites      This is certainly a time for effective diplomacy 
Illinois finally got off our ugly list  after over two years  by passing a budget  While not a complete answer  it is a step  Road construction  promised educational payments  debt repayment  and Powerball will now resume 
Noteworthy
I spotted some great charts that you will enjoy     One of them  which I cannot represent here  shows worldwide immigration over the last 200 years or so  Take a look  to see the streams of people change throughout history 
For a US focus  consider how immigration patterns have changed  Part of the changes reflect the changing identification of residents 

The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
It is a light calendar  with mostly secondary reports  Chair Yellen s testimony before Congress   House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday and a repeat for the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday   could prove interesting  I expect a more hawkish tone and the usual challenging questions from some  Retail sales is important  It is an important sector and there was weakness in the prior report  The inflation data will eventually be important  but not yet 
There is also some FedSpeak  and the release of the Beige Book  Those who want to focus on the Fed will have plenty of material 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
With the light calendar and low volatility  what will people write and talk about 
Mrs  OldProf provided the answer this morning at breakfast  As usual we split the Trib   sports for her and front section for me  She soon observed that it  was hard to be a Cub   Encouraged to elaborate  she explained that whatever the specific news  the story was always about the disappointing first half performance  A star hits two home runs  The team releases a catcher who allowed seven stolen bases in a single game  Both are treated similarly  Will this turn the Cubs around  The celebrated general manager  who was acclaimed as a genius until a few weeks ago  is expected to stir the pot somehow 
She is quite right  It sounds so familiar  Since I was thinking about this week s theme  her comment was especially helpful  What she described is just what we are seeing in the  analysis  of the current stock market  Most stories are about the long bull market  Often there is an angle about the end of the rally  How much longer  What can go wrong 
It is a Seinfeld market  The story is about nothing  but must be described along the way  With nothing better to discuss  people will be asking 
What should we expect for the rest of 2017 
Here is a range of opinion 
We are lucky to have lasted this long 
The Fed gaveth and the Fed will taketh away  Most of the trading community is on this side   a couple of recent examples where Central Banker comments got a strange twist  Also contra     who uses market maker hedging as a key indicator  He sees no change in the hedging patterns  indicating no immediate problems 
Technical warnings   some sector moves that seem to suggest  that the rally is capitulating   Contra   the  sees a Dow Theory buy signal 
Everything is good  which always precedes a market top  This was Greg Ip s call  Fox republishing a WSJ piece     I cited  in a tweet where I suggested  You cannot use a shining sun as a predictor of nightfall  Mr  Ip courteously retweeted my link  See also  
Fundamentals remain strong with no sign of imminent danger  CNBC s  looks at the ten year anniversary of the prior market top  See also  and an update of sixteen charts 
Tongue in cheek advice to pundits   gives ten bullet points to consider in helping you call a market top  This post has the great combination of being both entertaining and very helpful  Here is the first bullet 
No  1  Pick a bogeyman  This is your first step to making a top call  Find whatever it is that will precipitate the next collapse  and home in on it  Tweet about it and write 5 000 word screeds explaining why this spells doom  The specific bogeyman isn t all that important   just so long as you have one  Some good starter examples are  the Federal Reserve  or zero interest rates or quantitative easing   the national debt  hyperinflation  or the collapse of the dollar  Or how about  or that robots will take away everyone s job  Mix and match these or be creative and invent a few of your own 


As usual  I ll have more in my Final Thought

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be  of ten things he believes most about investing  I particularly like this example 

Many failures can be traced to the pointless pursuit of arbitrary benchmarks  Most notable is the calendar  which pushes companies and investors to cut corners before the earth completes its rotation around the sun  Swap out the sun for another celestial body and you ve described a mental illness  Another is index benchmarks  which use something short term and broad  industry performance  to guide something long term and specific  a strategy to meet your goals  

Stock Ideas
Homebuilders   closely follows upgrades and downgrades  I do not always agree  but the Merrill Lynch call on Homebuilders makes sense to me 
Energy  Barron s  subscription required  has an interesting article citing an expert who sees a floor in energy prices  The basic idea is that traders over reacted to the original OPEC supply limitation  not considering a key loophole  This has led to unwarranted swings in prices  If you are interested  this is one you must evaluate for yourself  There is also an interesting stock pick on this theme 
Lee Jackson    cites the public statements from Merrill Lynch  with five picks based upon crude  bouncing  off a low of  42  These are generally bigger   safer  names 
Chip Stocks  Lee Jackson has more ideas from Merrill  One of these passes some of Chuck Carnevale s tests  so I am looking   does a comprehensive analysis of Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  which we bought a few weeks ago 
Defense stocks  A reaction to N  Korea   ranks thirteen companies 
Biotech  whether Gilead  NASDAQ GILD  could learn something from Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   I hope so  since I like both 
Good companies  seven attractive companies and shows how to find those worth further study  I usually prefer reading to watching videos  but Chuck covers key points in an upbeat style 
Dividends  Simply Safe Dividends does a comprehensive analysis of Archer Daniels Midland  NYSE ADM   He looks at the business history  the current revenue drivers  and all the key metrics  Readers will enjoy the helpful diagrams and charts  Over at the   our dip buying model  Holmes  is cheering at the support for his pick of the week 
Personal Finance
Seeking Alpha Senior Editor Gil Weinreich has an interesting topic every day  This week I especially enjoyed  on warnings and predictions  If you read today s  Final Thought  you will see some ideas of how to implement this  Gil also considers 26 retirement risks from     and that is certainly a good place to start 
Watching stock quotes too frequently will reduce your performance     Warren Buffett does not even have a computer on his desk  Suppose you were getting a 15  return with 10  volatility   a combination that most would find attractive  Here is how this translates into returns in different time frames

Final Thoughts
Most market pundits and sell side strategists are forced to write   whether anything important is happening or not  Some of this is driven by the calendar  especially when doing an annual forecast or revising it for the second half 
Many have allowed some simplistic notions to distort their analytic framework  If you attribute the stock rally to the Fed  ignore what Shiller and Buffett really said about valuation  and use  averages  to tell you how long a business cycle will be   you are starting your risk reward analysis at a big disadvantage 
I do not make annual market forecasts  I certainly do not get tied to a calendar  Individual investors might find this approach useful 
Discover some trusted indicators for both risk and reward 
Find investments that represent good companies at good value 
Do a regular review  adjusting your stock price targets to reflect the most recent information 
Adjust your portfolio as needed  including the risk level  asset classes  and individual stock positions 
You are not forecasting  You do not need a year end market target  You need not call a top or bottom  You should not try to beat the market in a specific time frame  since your inexpensive stocks  at the start  will be out of step with current market perceptions 
A strong investment process is easy to describe  challenging to implement  and rewarding when done well 
What worries me 
China  Russia  and North Korea  The second meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping did not turn out as well as the earlier meeting at the Trump Florida resort  The Putin Trump meeting did not lead to much in the way of a detailed update  The cooperation of both will be needed in dealing with North Korea   had a helpful summary of this topic  including some good links 
Trade  The EU is initiating some trade restrictions against the US  I am watching this issue closely 
 and what doesn t

Stock market valuation  Stocks overall seem mildly attractive if you consider expected earnings and interest rates  More importantly  some are significantly overvalued and others are attractive  Stock and sector picking are more important than market valuation ",2017-07-09,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-a-seinfeld-market-200199829,200199829

145268,366783,LRCX,Lam Research  Athenahealth  Wynn Resorts  Melco Crown Entertainment And Golden Entertainment Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 07  2017   Lam Research  NASDAQ        as the Bull of the Day  athenahealth  NASDAQ        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ         Melco Crown Entertainment  NASDAQ        and Golden Entertainment  NASDAQ        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

	I last wrote about Lam Research  NASDAQ        as Bull of the Day in late April after they delivered the earnings  trifecta  of top and bottom line beats and raised guidance 

	I had some fun then talking about the  lam basting  the bears took who were shorting shares under  130 

	But I ve had a lot more fun simply owning shares of LRCX 
	Because since then  three things keep going up  the EPS estimates  the analyst price targets  and the stock 
	Let s review the markets served by this premier semiconductor equipment maker who specializes in the industry known as WFE  wafer fabrication equipment   To start  I can do no better than share this excellent and simple self description on the company s Overview website page   To produce the tiny  complex chips used in products such as cell phones  computing devices  and entertainment gadgets  semiconductor manufacturers require highly sophisticated processes and equipment  Lam s products play a key role in this  allowing chipmakers to build device features that are more than 1 000 times smaller than a grain of sand  In fact  nearly every leading edge integrated circuit made today has been processed with Lam Research equipment  
	Lam s market leading products are used in several steps that are repeated multiple times throughout the chip making process  including thin film deposition  plasma etch  photoresist strip  and wafer cleaning Estimates Move Higher
	After the company s third quarter report on April 18  for fiscal year 2017 ending in June   analysts raised the current year s EPS consensus 6 6  from  9 22 to  9 83 
	But the full year 2018 profit projection rose a whopping 21  to  10 28 from  8 49 
	And in the last 30 days  as Semiconductor analysts study global chip demand and rework their sales and earnings models  the estimates keep climbing for Lam 

  

athenahealth   NASDAQ       is a  5 5 billion provider of software and services for physicians and hospitals  Their web based business services for medical groups and institutions are based on proprietary practice management and electronic health records  EHR  software  a continuously updated payer knowledge base  and integrated back office service operations 
	One of their specialty services helps doctors with billing and collections using a revenue calculator that shows medical professionals how they can increase payment amounts and timeliness using data pulled from a 99 000 provider network 
	The company claims that their patented Billing Rules Engine and expert service teams are proven to get more claims paid on first submission  reduce days in accounts receivable  and dramatically reduce patient no shows 
	Since the end of 2012 through the first quarter of this year  athenahealth grew annual revenues at a 27  CAGR from  422 million to  1 112 billion 
	The company  whose CEO Jonathan Bush is cousin to George W   43  is based in Watertown  MA and has recently become the target of activist investor Paul Singer who runs the  33 billion hedge fund group Elliott Management 
	More on that story after we discuss why the stock is a Zacks  5 Rank  Strong Sell  Earnings Disappointment Brings Estimates Down
	On April 27  athenahealth reported adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and declining almost 9  on a year over year basis 
	The company posted revenues of  285 4 million  which also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  297 million but increased 11 3  on a year over year basis 
	athenahealth registered operating margin of 7 7  in the first quarter compared with 9 4  in the year ago quarter 
	For fiscal 2017  the company expects revenues in the band of  1 210  1 250 million  Adjusted operating income is projected in the range of  120  140 million with annual bookings expected at around  350  400 million 
	In response to this report and outlook  analysts took the 2017 full year EPS consensus down 29  from  1 18 to  0 84  representing negative 18   growth  And the 2018 profit projection slipped an unhealthy 31 45  from  1 59 to  1 09

3 Casino Stocks to Buy Now

	Perhaps it s because trading stocks can often mirror the thrill of winning big at the blackjack tables  or maybe it s because Las Vegas conjures images of the world s most flashy brands and businessmen  Regardless of the reason  it s clear that casino stocks are always among the most popular on Wall Street

	Luckily for investors  now is also a great time to be buying casino stocks  as continued domestic strength and a great recovery in Macau have led to rising share prices  In fact  the overall gaming industry currently sits in the top 26  of the Zacks Industry Rank 

	With casino stocks this hot right now  investors are not going to want to miss out  Luckily  we can use Zacks  proven stock picking methods to find solid stocks in any industry  Check out these highly ranked casino stocks today 

1  Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ      

	Led by the legendary Steve Wynn  this iconic gaming brand once again posted impressive earnings results in the most recent quarter  Wynn reported earnings of  1 24 per share and revenues of  1 48 billion  surpassing our respective consensus estimates of  0 74 and  1 34 billion  The company s new Macau resort  the Wynn Palace  marked its second full quarter of operations  lifting total revenue figures 48  on a year over year basis 

	Since the report  we ve seen a flurry of earnings estimate revision activity for WYNN  lifting its current quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate by 31 cents and giving the stock a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   And looking down the road  Wynn is positioned well in Macau and Vegas  the company just finalized plans for the Le Reve which it has designed to be the preeminent luxury hotel and destination casino resort in Sin City 

2  Melco Crown Entertainment   NASDAQ      

	Melco Crown was another casino giant that really impressed in the most recent earnings season  The company  which gets the majority of its revenue from Macau  posted adjusted earnings of  0 24 per share  crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 08  Revenues of  1 28 billion also topped our consensus estimate and soared 15 7  year over year 

	Revenues in Macau grew 24  in the month of May  beating estimates and marking the tenth straight month of growth in the region  This is great news for Melco Crown  which has steadily risen all year  Indeed  shares are up 40  year to date  Nevertheless  this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock is poised to break even higher 

3  Golden Entertainment   NASDAQ      

	Formed in 2015 after the merger of Golden Gaming and Lakes Entertainment  Golden Entertainment is a regional casino and tavern operator that has been on an absolutely insane run this year  with shares gaining nearly 45  so far 

	And while some investors may say that means GDEN is trading at a premium  all signs point to continued growth for this stock  Shares could certainly still march higher  as indicated by its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ranking  and it is fundamentally sound  evidenced by its  A  grades for Value and Growth

 Let s take a look at how you could club these stocks with the right set of parameters to turn the tide in your favor A Peek in to 52 Week High StocksStocks near 52 week highs often instill the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  in the minds of investors  This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor Many a times  such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers  Meanwhile  news pertaining to robust sales  surging profit levels  bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher However  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52 week high bar  Wall Street s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it Also  recent academic research reveals that if a stock s current price is near its 52 week high  there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period   According to researchers George and Hwang  holding 52 week high stocks for six months resulted in an average monthly gain of 0 45  between 1963 and 2001  Encouragingly  this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum based strategies Setting the Right FiltersOur diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52 week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries  The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations  sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales  which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time Current Price 52 Week High     80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week high mark soon   Change Price   4 Weeks   5It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks   Change Price   12 Weeks   5This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well Price Sales    XIndMedThe lower  the better P E using F 1  Estimate    XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings  It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0     XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism Zacks Rank   1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank  which has proved its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market  You can see  Current Price    5This

145327,366842,LRCX,Lam Research  FreightCar America  Twitter And Facebook Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   April 27  2017   highlights Lam Research  NASDAQ        as the Bull of the Day  FreightCar America  NASDAQ        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Twitter  Inc   NYSE        and Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB    NASDAQ        

	Here is a synopsis of all four stocks 

  

Lam Research   NASDAQ       delivered the goods on April 18 that I had been telling you about for two months in articles like  Give Me Sales Growth   on February 25 and  from April 12 
	Here s what I told my TAZR Trader group  where we first bought LRCX under  115 in mid February  after Lam reported earnings last week   
	Another quarter  another round of schooling the recalcitrant bears who want to short semiconductors just because the stocks have run so hard in the past year  According to the Merriam Webster dictionary   The origins of lambaste are somewhat uncertain  but the word was most likely formed by combining the verbs lam and baste  both of which mean  to beat severely    Incidentally  lambaste can also be spelled lambast  despite the modern spelling of the verb baste   

The Earnings Trifecta
	Lam Research delivered the earnings  trifecta  we love  top and bottom line beats and raised guidance 
	We don t really want to harm recalcitrant bears  But we don t mind severely beating Wall Street estimates 
	At last glance around 6pm ET  LRCX shares were up over  6   4 75   on heavy short covering volume of 450K  Here were the details   
	Revenue in the March quarter climbed to  2 154 billion  yielding EPS of  2 80 
	Analysts had been modeling  2 125 billion on the top and  2 55 on the bottom  for a 1 35  sales beat and a 10  EPS beat 
	For the current quarter  the company sees revenue of  2 2 billion to  2 4 billion  and EPS of  2 88 to  3 12  topping consensus of  2 19 billion and  2 65 per share 
	Stifel analyst Patrick Ho  a big LRCX bull who commented positively ahead of earnings  was quick to offer commentary afterwards 
	Ho noted that Lam reported 2017 Q3 beats driven by strong shipments to Korea and Taiwan  Since he probably needs time to digest management s upgraded outlook for the year before he adjusts his earnings model  he would only reiterate his  150 price target tonight 

	But we should expect many analysts to raise estimates in the coming days 

  

FreightCar America   NASDAQ       has consistently been a Zacks  5 Rank  Strong Sell  for most of the past 2 years as demand for coal carrying freight cars  its specialty  slowed down 
	It was just last week that I wrote about another rail car maker  American Railcar Industries  ARII   in the cellar of the Zack Rank for similar reasons as the energy bear market mauled demand for its tank cars 
	In that article  I referred to our resident expert on the rails  Tracey Ryniec  for correctly warning investors not to fall into some of these industrial  value traps  
	Well the  162 million RAIL was never a P E value in recent history and after earning a profit of  0 43 last year  the 2017 EPS consensus is for a big drop to   0 56 
	And Tracey was all over it a year ago too  Here s what she had to say in March of 2016 when RAIL was trading around  15 and the estimates kept slipping away   The Best Year Since 2006 But   
	On Feb 22  of 2016   the company reported fourth quarter and full year results which were the best since 2006  Even allotting for the sale of its railcar repair and maintenance services  it was still a record year 
	But  that is expected to change over the next several years  The railcar manufacturing business has always been cyclical and it is now heading into the  down  part of the cycle 
	You can see the change in the earnings picture 
	2015   2 32
	2016 expected   1 50
	2017 expected   1 41
	2016 is an earnings decline of 35 3  year over year 
	Now  you probably notice right away  that even with that 35  EPS drop into 2016  a year ago Tracey was looking at a healthier profit outlook than has actually come to pass 
	And she was still bearish on this outlook 
	Here she continues on the key questions which show that Tracey was way ahead of most Wall Street analysts in forecasting further declines in sales and profits   Backlog To Fall
	The best indicator of the down side is the backlog 
	Year end manufacturing backlog peaked in December 2014 at 14 791  At the end of December 2015 it was 9840  Non coal cars comprised 99 6  of the total backlog as of Dec 31  2015 

	I would expect it to continue to fall as the number of orders remains lighter than prior years Is It Cheap 
	Shares have dropped to 2 year lows 
	But is it a bargain  They re trading with a forward P E of just 10 which seems cheap but with earnings expected to decline over the next 2 years  this could be a value trap 

	For investors who are holding on through the down cycle  the company does pay a dividend  currently yielding 2 4  
	 end of Tracey Ryniec s excellent analysis 
	That dividend holds steady at  0 36  with a 2 76  yield now  Maybe that s why the shares don t fall further  and are able to recover from scary 2 day flushes from  13 to  11 like we saw last November 

	Those who like that dividend appear to hold their shares steady 
	And with a fantastic Price to Sales ratio under 0 35  it s certainly a value stock  For now 

	But with this year s sales forecast at  346 4 million    already a 34  drop from last year    and next year looking at a 15  fall to  293 5 million  I d say there have to be better ways to earn a dividend then to ride these rails of declining sales

Here s How Twitter  TWTR  Smashed Earnings Estimates 

	Shares of Twitter  Inc   NYSE        skyrocketed on Wednesday morning after the struggling social media platform reported greater than expected user growth in its first quarter earnings report 

	Twitter blew user growth estimates out of the water by adding 9 million monthly active users  MAUs  in the first quarter of 2017  The social network now boasts 328 million monthly users  which is still well below rivals Facebook Inc   NASDAQ        and Instagram 

	Just a week ago  our consensus estimate  which was based on the independent research of 20 analysts  called for Twitter to hit 320 8 million MAUs in the quarter 

	Twitter grew its U S  user base in the first quarter by 3 million  It took Twitter all of 2016 to add roughly that many users in the U S 

	The company also reported that its daily active usage increased 14  year over year  which marked the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in that important revenue generating area 

	Since the micro blogging company released its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday morning  Twitter s stock price jumped 11 08  to  16 28 per share in morning trading  Twitter is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

	On top of the boost in users  Twitter reported revenues of  548 3 million in the first quarter  which beat Zacks Consensus Estimate of  512 1 million  Twitter lost far less than the estimated  0 16 per share  reporting a loss of  0 05 per share  The increased user numbers played a big part in both of Twitter s relatively big beats 

	Twitter reported a  40 3 million operating loss  but that figure came in much lower than the  59 1 million loss the company posted a year earlier 

	The Jack Dorsey led company s revenues were down 7 8  year over year  due in large part to the fact that Twitter now makes less money per ad due to the shift to auto play video ads  However  the positive user growth has helped give Twitter a much needed boost  as investors continue to give the company a shot in the arm on Wednesday

145346,366861,LRCX,Stocks  Bonds And Gold  Snapshot Of A Shifting Macro,opinion,"Over the last year we transitioned from the stock market angst of 2015 to the bullish breakout of 2016  For   the real proof in the pudding was the ramp up in the cyclical Semiconductor sector s Equipment sub segment  Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  and the like   Specifically  we tracked a trend in Equipment orders and projected a bullish Semi sector a year ago  The logical extension of this was a bullish stock market  since the Semis are a leader 
What a difference a year makes  Reference AMAT Chirps  B2B Ramps  Yellen Hawks and Gold s Fundamentals Erode from last May  Our best target for the SOX index was around 940 and late arriving momentum players  and their  quant  machines  have driven the index beyond reason of late  to a high of 1017 last month  It is time for a cool down in this leader  potentially a real deep freeze because it has been running way too hot 
Always looking ahead  and only looking behind for frames of reference  we see that some macro signals are shifting beneath conventional market participants  feet  First  as I began clubbing people over the head with in January  the Treasury bond market was set up to catch everyone off guard  Who called the bottom in bonds  Why  none other than media star Louise Yamada and Bloomberg with the headline R I P  Bond Bull as Charts Say Last Gasps Have Been Taken  All of this hysteria because Louise knew how to draw a single line on a chart of the 10 year yield 

 Prices of bonds are going to go down and you are going to lose your capital   said Yamada  who began her technical forecasting career at Smith Barney under mentor Alan Shaw 

Here was my response from a post called  ironically enough   on December 16 

But let s take it further and draw a different trend line than Yamada s  let s make a post 1986 trend line and then add a parallel lower line to form a trend channel  Taking another step further  let s note that the high set on the late 2013 GREAT ROTATION     out of bonds and into stocks  hype in the financial media exactly 3 years ago is the decision point on a new trend  and that happens to more or less coincide with the upper channel line 
But first things first  TNX has not even broken the moving average yet  it is 2 69  vs  a current yield of 2 58   

Here is the updated chart  All the 10 year yield has done is decline since the big proclamation about rising yields  declining bonds   This was 100  in line with the contrarian setup for bonds as the Yamada Bloomberg media complex unwittingly marked the bottom in bonds  almost to the day 

But the above is a digression from the points I want to make in this post  Those points are that certain indicators of general market risk are rising and at the same time  these indicators could point to a coming counter cyclical atmosphere  if the fledgling breakouts shown below go on to higher levels and new trends   Let s begin  aptly enough  with Treasury bonds 
The long term Treasury bond fund  NASDAQ TLT  is finally  I did have to exercise a lot of patience  although the steady dividend income helped  breaking out from a double bottom  The target is the declining 200 day moving average  This is a bounce only for this risk  off  item  and we are not necessarily bearish on the stock market beyond the current correction 

But here is where it gets interesting for gold  Anything look familiar to you  This is exactly the reason we talk about tuning out inflationist gold bugs and tuning in to the reality that the gold sector is counter cyclical  Think of it this way  TLT above would not be rising in an inflationary environment  No  it rises with counter cylical and or deflationary forces  Gold vs  SPX  NYSE GLD NYSE SPY  below does the same thing 

It is for this reason that we harp on the  Macrocosm  as the driver of the counter cyclical gold sector s real fundamentals  What s the biggest planet  Why  Gold SPX above 

Now  if TLT is only indicated to be on a bounce to its declining SMA 200  so too likely is gold vs  the stock market 
Folks  we are on a macro shift and bounce right now but changing the macro for real is going to take a lot of time  and successful management of these changes is going to take a lot of flexibility and on the go analysis  Commit to remaining aware of what is on a bounce  what is on a trend and what it would take to put all these elements into a blender and change current trends  Commit to working at it  because one day when the macro pivots and changes for real  it will have been well worth it 
I am being purposefully vague with conclusions because those conclusions can only be made through the details we work at every week in NFTRH  Putting out set in stone conclusions in this atmosphere could do more harm than good because the markets are in motion and often contradictory from one time frame to another  It takes management  Manage ",2017-04-14,Gary Tanashian,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks,-bonds-and-gold;-snapshot-of-a-shifting-macro-200182912",200182912
145347,366862,LRCX,Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights  IBM  Lam Research  EBay And NCR,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   April 18  2017   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  IBM  NYSE           Lam Research  NASDAQ           eBay  NASDAQ          and NCR Corp  NYSE          

This Week in Tech Stocks

	The calendar is heating up this week for tech stocks  We have several companies reporting earnings  One newer name that is coming out of its quiet period  Finally  there is one stock that is seeing its lockup expire so we will touch on that too 

Earnings This Week

	Tuesday after the close we have two big tech names in IBM  NYSE         and Lam Research  NASDAQ           IBM has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last 6 quarters but the price reaction following the report has not been all that positive  Add to that the idea revenue will show a year over year decrease and a 0  Earnings ESP score and sitting this one out might be the best most  LRCX is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that has also beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last 6 quarters and has seen its stock move less than 4   up or down  following all of those reports  A good strategy for that play could be an options strangle 



	Wednesday has eBay  NASDAQ           a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Both have Earnings ESP of 0  so there isn t too much to go on there  I see that EBAY missed the most recent quarter yet the stock advanced by 5 8  in the session following the announcement  EBAY tends to move following earnings so an options straddle might make some sense as the stock moved  12 9  two times and  13 2  once in the last six quarters  The smallest move was a 4 3  advance following the March 2016 quarter 

	Thursday after the close will see numbers from NCR Corp  NYSE          I have written about NCR being a beneficiary of new technology for ATM machines  but investors should really be cashing in on this stock  Right now  NCR is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that has an  A  for the Growth and Value style score  Trading at 13x forward earnings is great  but add to that a solid history of beating the number and you have something worth taking a deeper look at 

Quiet Period Ending

	After a company holds an IPO the investment banks that took the stock public tend to wait 25 days before initiating coverage  Look for new coverage to come from Goldman  JP Morgan  Barclays  LON BARC   Citi  Pacific Crest  William Blair  JMP Securities  Raymond James and Cowen for Alteryx  The company priced 9M shares at  14 and they opened for trading at  17 25  That turned out to be very close to the high  which was reached later that day at  17 50 

	AYX doesn t have a Zacks Rank yet as the rank is based on earnings estimate revisions from the brokerages that cover the stock  Keep in mind that this is a pretty small company  roughly  150M in market cap  but it looks to have some big name coverage soon  That should get the story to some of the bigger institutions  but most of the bigger institutions have a requirement that investments only be made in stocks that are over  1B in market cap 

Lockup

	As part of the IPO process  the underwriters usually include a lockup clause to restrict insiders from selling their shares  Usually  this is 180 days following the IPO  The end of the lockup has come for Crispr Therapeutics and there are now 27 135 884 shares that can be sold  Thing is  I would not expect much more than 1  of that total to find its way to the market  The stock only trades about 65K shares per day  so even if an insider wanted to dispose of 7K shares that would be 10  of a day s trading and would likely impact the price 

	Right now I see CRSP up 2  on volume of around 22K shares  So if you wanted to short this one into the lock up  you probably made the wrong move  CRSP has yet to get a Zacks Rank

5 Value Stocks with Exciting EV EBITDA Ratios to Buy Now

	The price to earnings  P E  multiple enjoys wide scale popularity among investors seeking stocks that are trading at attractive prices  In addition to being a widely used tool for screening stocks  P E is also a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm  However  even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few downsides 

Why EV EBITDA is a Better Option 
	While P E is undoubtedly the most commonly used equity valuation ratio in the market  a more complicated valuation metric called EV EBITDA works even better  Often viewed as a better alternative to P E  EV EBITDA offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential 
	EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Basically  it is the full value of a company 
	EBITDA  the other component of the multiple  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it strips out non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows 
	Typically  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could imply that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice versa 
	EV EBITDA  also dubbed as the enterprise multiple  takes a more comprehensive approach to valuation  While P E just considers a firm s equity portion  EV EBITDA determines its total value  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Stocks boasting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates 
	Another major downside of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In comparison  EV EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can also be used to value firms that have negative net earnings but are positive at the EBITDA level 
	EV EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of companies with a debt laden balance sheet and substantial depreciation and amortization expenses  Moreover  the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels 
	But EV EBITDA is not without its limitations and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital requirements 

	As such  a strategy solely based on EV EBITDA might not yield the desired results  But you can club it with other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks Screening Criteria
	Here are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median   The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median   This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000   The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 
	Here are five of the 12 stocks that passed the screen Teradyne Inc   NYSE     is a manufacturer of automatic test equipment and related software for the electronics and communications industries  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has an expected EPS growth rate of 12 4  for 3 to 5 years Lam Research Corporation  Nasdaq     designs  manufactures  markets and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has expected year over year earnings growth of 20 5  for 2016 Regions Financial Corporation  NYSE     is a regional bank holding company and has banking related subsidiaries engaged in mortgage banking  credit life insurance  leasing  and securities brokerage activities with offices in various Southeastern states  This Zacks Rank  2 company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of around 7 5  over the trailing four quarters  You can see     Cosan Limited  NYSE     is the leading global ethanol and sugar company in terms of production with low cost  large scale and integrated operations in Brazil  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has an expected EPS growth rate of 15 7  for 3 to 5 years Preferred Apartment Communities  Inc    NYSE     is a real estate investment trust that acquires and operates multifamily properties primarily in the U S  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has expected year over year earnings growth of 12 1  for 2016 and 9 2  for 2017

145370,366885,LRCX,2016  A Year For Contrarians  2017 Shaping Up That Way As Well,opinion,"2016 was a year that fit my niche to a tee and it is no coincidence that it has been a good one  performance wise  though in full disclosure  the last couple of weeks have taken a chunk of profits back as I give the markets some leeway through the  Santa  seasonal   Let s take a stroll through 2016 before taking a brief look ahead to 2017 
The year started with the topping pattern  that wasn t  or isn t yet  in the S P 500  For all the world it looked like a top  walked like a top and quacked like a top  But it wasn t a top 
That was proven when SPX rebounded from its lower low to the 2014 and 2015 lows and then rose to cross the 20 and 50 week exponential moving averages back up again  This was similar to the 2011 whipsaw  but on a grander scale  Now of course  the would be topping pattern may be a left shoulder to a bearish Head   Shoulders pattern in construction  But even if so  the ultimate high could be well higher  ref  the 1998 2000 situation   As of now  the market is bullish  Period 

But considering that Casino Patrons are momo ing the market and dumb money is strongly over bullish  and the market is overvalued  one important valuation metric being the greater interest being paid on  risk free  Treasury bonds vs  the S P 500  as the media TRUMPets a new promotion  namely bond eroding inflation as far as the eye can see due to coming fiscal policy changes 
The Treasury bond bull market  trumpets the mainstream financial media  Well  for another view  let s compare what the public was doing last summer during the NIRP  hysteria vs  today 

Thanks to the data from  we are able to see that herds of dumb money  per the Public Optimism Index or OPTIX  was thundering into Treasury bonds despite historically low yields last summer because  BREXIT    and NIRP    
This was just in time to create a top in bonds prior to dynamic changes over the second half of the year  Now the public hates bonds because  Trump  because  inflation  because  media  Well  Trump s election did not cause the bond market to fall apart  it was already bearish after last summer s big  momentum fueled sentiment event put the dumb money all in 
Now  who was taking the bearish side of the market last summer  The same people taking the bullish side today  the Commercial Hedgers  AKA the smart money  For the sake of space  let s not cover too much old ground  You can see the Hedgers  general positioning   in which I poked the trend following  rabble rousing media in the eye as it used a simple line drawn by Louise Yamada to make a big declaration in order to get people all worked up  and emotional  
Above we have covered the early part of the year with respect to the stock market s failure to do what it was  supposed  to do  and some incredible contrarian bond market dynamics in 2016 
Now switching back to stocks  we had two great sentiment events this year  which anecdotally at least  seemed to get the max number of players going the wrong way  Those would be the Brexit and US Election hysterias  Common themes attended both of these events  keeping us on the bull side of the barn  We poked the media in the eye about these promotions as well  and 
For each situation sentiment was over bearish right into the actual event  The other common theme   for the broad US stock market at least   was that major technical support was completely intact  as we noted occasionally in public and constantly in our reports  What do they say about an intact uptrend  When pullbacks occur on over bearish sentiment during an uptrend  it is usually a buying opportunity 
Looking at a specific sector  when an industry  in this case Semiconductor Equipment  had positive fundamentals  as we tracked each month  and is technically intact  a bearish sentiment backdrop was a buy  as we noted back in May  Applied Materials Inc  NASDAQ AMAT  and Lam Research Corp  NASDAQ LRCX  came to be our primary Semi Equipment picks     and  
During the time frame of the above linked posts  I was being told that a renowned technology  expert  was exactly opposite my stance  bearish the semis and bullish on gold  You may or may not remember me grousing about that last summer  My belligerence even  a long time subscriber 
Today  I note small and large analytical sources falling all over themselves recommending these Semi Equipment companies  Trend followers all 
I would estimate that 90  of what you read in the financial media  whether at the big shops like Bloomberg and Marketwatch or out there in the blogsphere where we little guys think we can add value to your investment theses  is unadulterated trend following  It s what sells  And your eyeballs need to be sold 
The financial media complex is not set up to tell you what is likely to happen  It is set up to tell you what has happened or is happening  From there it will often extrapolate to tell you what will happen  and with current events backing the extrapolation at any given time  90  of information consumers will take it seriously  forgetting later just who provided the faulty information as it gets lost in the massive buzz of the electronic media industry 
2016 was mainly an exercise in maintaining discipline with respect to technical analysis signposts  most notably  simple support and resistance levels  and discipline from a contrary perspective 

 Nothing would be what it is  because everything would be what it isn t  And contrary wise  what is  it wouldn t be  And what it wouldn t be  it would  You see  

At this moment in time I cannot tell you whether the S P 500 will proceed directly to our long held operating target of 2410 or not  I cannot tell you whether it will get there in our lifetimes or get cut through like warm butter in January 
But that is the whole point  we are at the traditional time of year when the bizarre ritual of crystal ball and tea leave reading is put on display by the financial media as last year s Wrong Way Corrigans attempt to get it right this year  knowing full well that media consumers do not take the time to go back and check records 
Here is my lone prediction  98  of these predictions will prove totally bogus and my follow on prediction is that only 5  of the reading audience will even care or remember come December 26  2017 
So I ll leave you with a simple note that in 2016  when the market was over bearish and people thought they knew bearish outcomes were in the offing  the opposite proved true  Today  at the dawn of a new year  sentiment analysis states that increasingly dumb money has made a commitment to what it thinks is a  new secular bull market  in the wake of the supposedly market friendly Trump election and its fiscal stimulus to come 
NFTRH 427 s Wrap Up segment addressed this 
The US market went bullish last winter and has remained bullish ever since  with an intervening major support test  We talked about that oncoming test for what seemed like forever  it came about and was successful  The US market is bullish 
Will it go bearish  The contrary setup is there  with a majority believing fiscal policy will create a new secular bull  Meanwhile  there continue to be sectors that have been out of favor  which may be winners going forward  I d remain open to continued bulling or a reversal to bearish  It is the market s decision  not ours 
But I d continue to argue that you cannot have a new secular bull market when the old bull market  a short secular or long cyclical bull from 2009  never ended  That was why we gauged the  higher low  major support test  A failure would have ended the bull  Support held and the bull remained intact 
If contrary sentiment analysis paves a way for a future risk  off  view  the likes of Treasury Bonds and Gold  key components of the lowly risk  off  trade  will have their day  I recommend you sit back  relax and let the contrarian signals come in without taking on the pressure and unrealistic expectations of pretending to know  It worked in 2016  after all ",2016-12-28,Gary Tanashian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2016:-a-year-for-contrarians;-2017-shaping-up-that-way-as-well-200170911,200170911
145371,366886,LRCX,Should Value Investors Pick Lam Research  LRCX  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Lam Research Corporation   NASDAQ LRCX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lam Research has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 32  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 28  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Lam Research s current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint  which is 16 42  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Computer and Technology sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 90  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Lam Research has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 02  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Lam Research stock in the near term too PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important  it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well  One can easily do that with the PEG ratio  ratio of the P E to the expected future earnings growth rate  The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P E ratio Lam Research s PEG ratio stands at just 1 21  compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 1 76  This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lam Research currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes LRCX a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 13 20  which is much better than the industry average of 17 87  Clearly  LRCX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Lam Research might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives LRCX a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  While the consensus estimate for the full year 2017 increased 3 9  in the past two months  the full year 2018 estimate has inched up by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lam Research Corporation Price and Consensus    This positive trend signifies somewhat bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineLam Research is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  top 2  out of more than 250 industries  and strong Zacks Rank  LRCX looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication sector has significantly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside Today s investment ideas are short term  directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator  In addition  I invite you to consider our long term opportunities  These rare trades look to start fast with strong Zacks Ranks  but carry through with double and triple digit profit potential  Starting now  you can look inside our home run  value  and stocks under  10 portfolios  plus more

145387,366902,LRCX,Is Lam Research  LRCX  Stock A Solid Choice Right Now ,opinion,"One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Lam Research Corporation   NASDAQ LRCX    This is because this security in the Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing Wafer Fabrication space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity  and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective This is important because  often times  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board  This is arguably taking place in the Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing Wafer Fabrication space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 10 out of more than 250 industries  suggesting it is well positioned from this perspective  especially when compared to other segments out there Meanwhile  Lam Research is actually looking pretty good on its own too  The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month  suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm s prospects in both the short and long term LAM RESEARCH Price and Consensus
    In fact  over the past month  current quarter estimates have risen from  1 80 per share to  2 20 per share  while current year estimates have risen from  6 91 per share to  7 56 per share  This has helped LRCX to earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   further underscoring the company s solid position  You can see So  if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry  consider Lam Research  Not only is its industry currently in the top third  but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late  suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment Confidential from Zacks Beyond this Tale of the Tape  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ",2016-11-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-lam-research-(lrcx)-stock-a-solid-choice-right-now-200165436,200165436
145391,366906,LRCX,5 Value Stocks With Exciting EV EBITDA Ratios To Buy Now,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  multiple enjoys wide scale popularity among investors seeking stocks that are trading at attractive prices  In addition to being a widely used tool for screening stocks  P E is also a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm  However  even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few downsides Why EV EBITDA is a Better Option While P E is undoubtedly the most commonly used equity valuation ratio in the market  a more complicated valuation metric called EV EBITDA works even better  Often viewed as a better alternative to P E  EV EBITDA offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings  is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Basically  it is the full value of a company EBITDA  the other component of the multiple  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it strips out non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Typically  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could imply that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice   also dubbed as the enterprise multiple  takes a more comprehensive approach to valuation  While P E just considers a firm s equity portion  EV EBITDA determines its total value  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Stocks boasting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another major downside of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In comparison  EV EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can also be used to value firms that have negative net earnings but are positive at the EBITDA  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of companies with a debt laden balance sheet and substantial depreciation and amortization expenses  Moreover  the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels But EV EBITDA is not without its limitations and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital requirements As such  a strategy solely based on EV EBITDA might not yield the desired results  But you can club it with other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less

Top 5 Value Stocks with Impressive EV EBITDA Ratios

	Price to earnings  P E  enjoys greater popularity among the metrics in the value investing world and is preferred by many while uncovering bargain stocks  A widely favored approach by value investors is to hunt for stocks that have a low P E ratio  However  even this straightforward  easy to calculate multiple has a few pitfalls 

EV EBITDA is a Better Option  But Why 
	P E is by far the most popular metric used by investors due to its simplicity  But a more complicated and less used metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings potential and has a more complete approach to valuation  While P E just considers a firm s equity portion  EV EBITDA determines its total value 
	EV EBITDA   also known as the enterprise multiple   is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In essence  it is the entire value of a company 
	The other element of the ratio  EBITDA  gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it strips out non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows 
	Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could imply that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice versa 
	Unlike the P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes debt on a company s balance sheet into account  Due to this reason  it is typically used to value potential acquisition targets  The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear  Stocks flaunting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates 
	Another drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making company  Moreover  a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the contrary  EV EBITDA is less amenable to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA positive 
	EV EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels 
	However  EV EBITDA is not without its limitations and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and its future performance  The ratio varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital requirements 

	So  instead of solely banking on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired outcome Screening Criteria
	Here are the parameters to screen for true value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000    The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market    of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 
	Here are five of the 11 stocks that passed the screen Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation  NYSE      offers a range of telecommunications services  including telephone  telegraph  leased circuits  data communication  terminal equipment sales and other services  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has an expected EPS growth rate of 9 5  for 3 to 5 years Amkor Technology  Inc   NASDAQ      is a leading provider of semiconductor packaging and test services  Moreover  the company is one of the leading developers of advanced semiconductor packaging and test technology  This Zacks Rank  1 stock delivered an average positive earnings surprise of around 131 3  over the trailing four quarters Magna International Inc   NYSE      is an independent supplier of original equipment components  assemblies  modules and systems and related tooling for cars and light trucks  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 11 7  for 3 to 5 years  You can see

145440,366955,LRCX,Semiconductors As Early Indicator  Implications For Gold  Economy,opinion,"The following is the opening segment of this week s   NFTRH 396  The report also covers  in detail  the technical status of US Global stock markets  precious metals  commodities  currencies and even a few individual gold miners and a couple of new  non gold related  NFTRH  trade ideas 
In January of 2013 we noted that the  Canary s Canary  chirped and signaled an economic up phase  such as it was  on the horizon  The Canary was the Semiconductor sector  which is cyclical and economically sensitive  The Canary s Canary is the Semi Equipment sector  manned by the likes of Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  and Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  
On Friday the market got a nice quarterly report from AMAT as it beat estimates across the board and offered positive guidance  The broader market used it as an excuse to at least temporarily neutralize a perfectly good  daily  bearish pattern on the S P 500  AMAT received  3 5 Billion in new orders  which is up 37  from last year 
Does this rhyme with something we have reviewed recently  Recall that the March Book to Bill ratio   b2b   shown below  for the Semi equipment sector was positive and more important than that  the  bookings  side of the equation was strong  The next b2b is due to be released on May 24 and it will be a key to our analysis going forward 
Display and NAND Flash memory chips saw big jumps while DRAM floundered  This illustrates why more modern  specialty chip companies are doing well and dinosaurs are lagging  But is it an economic signpost  I have created new multi paneled charts with relevant gold ratios and this seems like a convenient time to introduce them  So let s interrupt the Semi discussion and see how the counter cyclical theme is shaping up 
Gold vs  global stock markets  counter cyclical indicator   S P 500  Stoxx 50  FTSE  TSX  ASX All Ordinaries  Nikkei  has been flat to down for several months now as markets positively correlated to the global economy have experienced relief  That is fine  we knew it would happen  At this time Au Stocks remains on a counter cyclical theme  above the moving averages   but that is being tested 

Gold vs  commodities  CRB  Oil  Industrial Metals  Agricultural Commodities  Palladium  Silver  was the earliest counter cyclical indicator  bottoming in 2014  whereas gold vs  stocks bottomed at the end of 2015   Up trends abound  especially vs  industrial metals  But gold vs  crude oil continues to drop and that is a drag  not only to the gold mining sector s cost structure  but it can also be watched as an early indicator on whether the counter cyclical  and anti inflationary  environment will remain intact 

So I ask gold bugs among the NFTRH subscriber base  what happens if the Semi equipment b2b comes in strong again on Tuesday  What do we then do if gold vs  stock markets and certain commodities continues to weaken and fail the tests of support that it is now on 
I ask these questions as Devil s Advocate  not as a predictor of coming events  Right now each of the chart panels remains above moving average breakout support  Au Stocks  or new  higher highs  higher lows  up trends  Au Commodities   But I will ask the question again if Tuesday s b2b comes in strong  Remember  the Semi equipment cycle is a very early economic cycle indicator  Is this a false positive or a new trend 
One positive month on bookings does not a trend make  but a second positive month would have to open the discussion  again  we ll know more come Tuesday  and a third month  data to be released in June  would be a trend 

Traveling back in history again  nobody was talking about the prospect of a new economic up cycle in January of 2013  We were  Last summer  nobody was talking about a coming change to a counter cyclical environment that could launch the gold sector  We were  the  Macrocosm  theme was introduced in July  
By the eye test the gold  community  is over bullish  Even the ones predicting an imminent correction are now long term bullish on gold  And yes  the gold ratio charts above show that is the way to be right now  Even if the  gold vs  commodities  charts break down  gold itself may do just fine if a persistent inflationary environment were to engage  because that would be consistent with a positive message in Semiconductors and an  inflation fueled  economic bounce 
But gold mining would become suspect vs  its peers in an  inflation trade   History has shown the miners can rise a long way while under suspicion  but we will call the fundamentals as we see them every step of the way 
We are using the Greenspan era as a blue print  That  inflation bull  was launched from a similar backdrop to what has been going on so far in 2016  i e  a counter cyclical  in that case  the 2001 2002 recession  environment 
We should not use one report from one Semi equipment company as anything remotely like a be all  end all  But as we have shown routinely  Semi leadership broke down last summer and has remained in breakdown mode vs  the S P 500  Is this  the AMAT report  the Canary s last gasp or something more musical to the ears of stock market players and even possibly  inflationists  investing for inflation fueled economic growth  
I will seek input from my industry contact and we ll see what  if any kind of a case we might build  The trend remains with  counter cyclical   but trends do change eventually 
SOX SPX above and SOX NDX below are still each in post 2012  leadership abdication  mode  technically speaking  If that changes and the Book to Bill changes trend  we will need to evolve our plans from counter cyclical to  inflationary growth   which was the phase that held sway for several years into the big market top in 2007

Analysis like this tends to be early to the party  as it was in January of 2013  well before the economic turnaround  such as it was  had become obvious to a majority  Indeed a challenge I continually have is to read signals yet remain in the moment of what is happening in the here and now and what the herd is doing 
Right now the herd has gold fever and to this point at least  that has been the right stance as indicated by the first two charts above  among other things ",2016-05-23,Gary Tanashian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/did-amat-chirp-implications-for-the-economy-and-gold-200131405,200131405
145441,366956,LRCX,Semiconductor Sector Rising  Why That s Good For Markets,opinion,"I am prompted to write this article because TA s are starting to pick up on the Semiconductor Index s bullishness and even the overwhelmingly bearish website  the Daily Reckoning is  on the Semiconductor sector 
The author uses only charts to clue readers in to this little secret  Semis led the market down and now they are leading it up  but there is much more to the story  and since it has been our story  for its upside and downside market leadership  since 2013  I ll lay claim before the whole enchilada opens up and every wise guy with a chart or a stock pick is touting the Semis 
We have been noting the relatively bullish status of the SOX  and this week  in light of the May book to bill  begun charting equipment stocks   along with a few other  relative bull  sectors  But I came across the most compelling evidence of a Semiconductor revival quite by accident while running through the US market indexes  Well  it was on purpose  but I was surprised at the timing as you ll see 
I took a long on the Banks  edit  quick profit taken on Monday  along with another on rising rates vehicle TBT  as the KBW Bank Index  BKX  dropped to support  That did not reflect a view on the pigs  it reflected a view on the hysteria surrounding declining interest rates  inflation expectations  etc 
The warning here is that hysterias can last longer than your trade tolerance  so I ll not be too patient  SOX is still bullish and the book to bill data will be out on  folks  we interrupt our regularly scheduled programming for  see below  

Attn  Stock Market Players and Gold Bugs Alike
I just went to check the date of the coming SEMI equipment sector book to bill data release and what did I find  This is what I found  Unexpectedly  it is already out 

Booking  Billings and Book to Bill for May are a knockout  What s more  we now have a 3 month trend in Semiconductor equipment bookings  With the strong billings as well  we probably have the makings of a good reporting season for Q2  April June  unless the world ends this month 
From SEMI  

 Bookings and billings for new semiconductor equipment continue to improve   said Denny McGuirk  president and CEO of SEMI   The data are consistent with higher spending expectations for the second half of the year    

I want to make note of something  here  for my gold bug friends  of which there are many in the subscriber base  Just as we noted Q2 s reporting may see some degradation in Q2 reporting for the miners due to the sharp rise in oil vs  gold  we note that the likes of Applied Materials Inc  NASDAQ AMAT   Lam Research Corp  NASDAQ LRCX   MKS Instruments Inc  NASDAQ MKSI   etc  are likely to continue to show why the SOX Index has been firm and leading the US markets of late  when Q2 is reported 
I felt squeamish in noting the Semi Equipment strength and its economic implications to you back in January of 2013 and in hindsight  these are the financial markets and there is no place for squeamish  The facts are the facts and Semi Equipment is ramping up again  This furthers our recent theme about the potential for a whopper of an inflation phase forthcoming as the Fed rolls over time and time again  ignoring price signals like those in the services sectors and lately  in the  prices paid  in manufacturing reports 
I am getting very bullish on inflation  So this time the Semi ramp does not need to mean destruction for the precious metals  Indeed  if silver picks up on this and takes over  we could get a heck of an inflationary ride  eventually  But remember  we are early and the mainstream is all screwed up over a variety of things  the deflation the Fed is pretending to see  BREXIT  global NIRP  etc  This all reaffirms what I wrote in the opening segment 
Frankly  I am getting so excited I have to settle down and remember that you can be right  but you can also be early  But with this SEMI release  combined with recent inflation data and price signals  combined with the state of the global market s mass psyche  oh no  deflation is everywhere     I think there is an opportunity here to make like Old Turkey  and be right  start to position for inflation  and sit tight 
There will be more to come in future reports  and in updates we will track the process and identify trading opportunities  Another note for gold bugs  if we go  inflation  the recently expressed preference for exploration and especially Royalty companies over pure gold miners will become a priority theme going forward 
Back on the US market  SOX continues to lead US indexes in a bullish manner since leading last summer s market bearishness  Is this signaling a new bull cycle out ahead  Stay tuned 


If this divergence holds through the current market upset and whatever is directly ahead  we should consider it a positive divergence on the stock market and the economy 
The point of the above is that you have got to have fundamental facts supporting your squiggly lines  AKA charts  otherwise the likes of the Semiconductor sector is just a  momo  play  potentially sucking you in at the behest of chart jockeys  I had awaited the 3rd month on the book to bill as a fundamental trend confirmation  and it was a knockout  as I said above 
Gold bugs who I have noticed are generally in full obsession mode  as in   I am a gold stock trader  as if it is the only sector out there  should be careful going forward  While we are working on a theme that could swing inflationary  benefiting the metals and Royalty companies if not as much gold miners  the relief that would be signaled if our view of the Semis  as upside leaders  is correct could hammer gold s risk  off  premium  along with that of Treasury bonds 
The main point is however  that we have got to deal with whatever the facts are  One fact is that the Semiconductor Equipment sector s  bookings  are very important to the entire sector s food chain  In other words  if new Fabs are being built and equipped then down the road Semiconductor manufacturers are expecting a ramp up in business  That is why I call the Equipment stocks the  Canary s Canary   with the sector as a whole being a leader but the Equipment sector s book to bill being an even earlier indicator 
There  now we have put some context to the coming phase when every momo  stock picker and chart jockey on the planet are going to get on the tout 
Post Script
I remember in 2002  2003  2004  as I became extremely bullish on gold I had Robert Prechter constantly in my ear telling me why 320 was the top and then 370 was the top and then 420  etc  it made me a stronger investor to read this  I did and still do respect this scary man s views  
On the current situation with the Semis  I was taken to task by a subscriber  I invite and welcome critical feedback at all times  a couple weeks ago  included in this post  It Must be a Gold Bull Market Because   

  Otto at IKN  says buy hold win and you are saying this is a blowoff  in gold  and people saying stocks are overbought are not right either  Bill Fleckenstein  Fred Hickey and Jesse Felder are all taking opposite stance on semis and the stock market and I don t consider them robots  I guess this makes markets  

I have not called it a blow off in gold  I have called it a launch to a potential new bull market  And in holding gold since 2003  I have to be believe I am in the  buy  hold  win  club  But the point is that experts will often challenge your stance  Fred Hickey is evidently a technology expert bearish on tech in general  Semis in particular  and bullish on gold and gold stocks  but going with your own analysis or at least vetting that of others ultimately makes you a stronger investor or trader 
There do not need to be dividing lines like  I am a gold bug and so that is mutually exclusive to other market views   There just needs to be right  within the context of time frames  At this point of the current cycle the Semiconductors are leading again and that has in the past meant positive future economic prospects  However  with the Fed sitting like a mother hen on its measly 1 4 point Fed Funds rate  inflationary chickens could well be coming home to roost on this cycle as well 
  The famous character  also known as Mr  Partridge  from Edwin Lef vre s Reminiscences of a Stock Operator   well  this is a bull market you know    ",2016-06-23,Gary Tanashian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/details-behind-semiconductor-leadership-200137669,200137669
145462,366977,LRCX,Lam Research Looks Like A Buy,opinion,"Hedge Fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital is noted for his investment prowess as well as his poker skills  So when he makes a move people watch and try to learn  But his latest reported move in Lam Research  O LRCX  looks like it may be one to ignore  or maybe even reverse 
Einhorn is reported to have sold his entire stake in Lam Research  While this likely happened a few weeks ago  the stock is looking pretty good right now  The chart below shows a double bottom with the market low in August and then again in September  Now moving higher  there are two patterns that both point to more upside 

The first is the bearish Shark harmonic  This pattern gives a upside Potential Reversal Zone  PRZ  at 87 16  where it may reverse lower  The second is the move higher from 64 into consolidation and now a break higher  This break targets a move to 88 
Momentum is on the side of higher prices too  The RSI is bullish and the MACD  although flat  is turning back higher  There is 10  short interest to fuel a move and the squeezing Bollinger Bands  suggest it will happen soon  Watch for the break and if it is to the upside  pick up the cards Einhorn has cast away
