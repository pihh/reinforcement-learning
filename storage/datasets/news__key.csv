204722,426238,KEY,KeyCorp  KEY  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"KeyCorp  NYSE KEY  is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 48 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  1 64 billion  down 0 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 93  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for KeyCorp 
For KeyCorp  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 43  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that KeyCorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that KeyCorp would post earnings of  0 47 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 48  delivering a surprise of  2 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
KeyCorp appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/keycorp-key-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200499346,200499346

204731,426247,KEY,Trump s Mexico plans reignite Banamex questions for Citigroup,news,"By Olivia Oran and David Henry  Reuters    For  Citigroup  Inc  N C  executives  being asked why they won t sell their Mexican bank subsidiary Banamex is as annoying as the yapping of a Chihuahua  But the question keeps coming up   In some of the first signs of how some investors in Corporate America are bracing for a President Donald Trump  several large investors have expressed concern to Citi management in recent private meetings about the impact a victory for the Republican might have on the Mexican unit  according to people who attended or were briefed on the meetings  Even if Trump did not follow through on his pledge to build a massive border wall  some investors voiced concern that his presidency would undermine cross border trade and travel  and in turn hurt the Mexican economy and Banamex profits  the sources added  asking not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak with the media  Trump is not the main reason investors are asking about divesting Banamex  nor is the idea a new one  But his talk of building a wall has renewed questions at a time when Citigroup stock continues to trade at a 25 percent discount to its tangible net worth  The stock is so low because investors doubt Citigroup s ability to boost its returns on equity any time soon  Trump  who has reduced the lead held by Democrat Hillary Clinton in recent polls ahead of the Nov  8 vote  has vowed to make Mexico fund the construction of a giant border wall to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into the U S  He has also pledged to change North American trade agreements and impose higher tariffs on Mexican goods to bring jobs back  At an investor conference on Wednesday  Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach was asked why he was so positive on Banamex  The question was similar to one asked in July by CLSA analyst Mike Mayo  who has been urging Citigroup to sell Banamex for years  Mayo told Reuters his rationale is  to unleash trapped value   He wants Citigroup to use Banamex sale proceeds to buy back its cheap stock  which would make the remaining shares more valuable  and attract more interest from investors   It would make crystal clear the absurdity of Citigroup stock trading at three fourths of tangible book   Mayo said  He said Citi could see a gain of  5 billion to  10 billion through a sale  Regardless of Trump  Citi CEO Mike Corbat has more reasons now than even two years ago to keep Banamex  people familiar with his thinking say  For one  Banamex earns about 15 percent return on shareholder equity   significantly better than Corbat s goal of at least 10 percent  In addition  Banamex contributes about 15 percent of Citigroup s global consumer revenue  which makes Mexico second only to the United States in importance  It has the most branches  with about 1 500 compared with 700 locations in the U S   where much of Citigroup consumer business is in cards   Corbat has overseen the disposal of half of Citigroup s country based consumer franchises  bringing the total down to 19  Banamex was deemed the only one in Latin America strong enough to keep  Banamex is the second biggest bank in Mexico  which Corbat expects will grow with the U S  economy  He expects trade with Mexico to continue to be robust regardless of whether Trump wins  IMPROVEMENTS SEEN Citigroup is starting to see improvements at Banamex following management changes in 2014 and Corbat s commitment then to invest  1 5 billion in its operations  Corbat announced the investment on a podium with the president of Mexico  The management changes followed discovery of more than  500 million of fraudulent loans that Banamex made to a Mexican oilfield services company  as well as U S  government investigations of money laundering at Banamex offices in the U S  Citigroup paid  140 million to settle federal regulators  probes into the money laundering matter  but a criminal investigation has yet to be publicly resolved  Corbat has since won approval from U S  regulators for two capital plans and an endorsement of its so called  living will   showing how the company could be wound down without taking other banks with it  The approvals imply that regulators have found Citigroup s risk management of Banamex acceptable   It s accretive to our shareholders  the returns are solid   Corbat said in July   So right now I really don t see it s an area where we would contemplate selling   Corbat doubts that Citigroup could quickly gather proceeds from selling Banamex and then win permission from the U S  Federal Reserve to use the money to buy back stock  said a person familiar with his thinking  Even without a Banamex sale  Citigroup has been building up excess capital that it expects the Fed will allow it to use for additional buybacks  In a March report  KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl argued that Citi should divest Banamex s consumer and small business franchise  It does not fit into Citi s consumer strategy in other emerging markets where it focuses on customers in high growth metropolitan areas  he said  An outright sale  Kleinhanzl wrote  could be difficult because the pool of potential buyers is small  But Citigroup could sell that portion of Banamex to investors through an IPO  commanding an  11 8 billion price tag  resulting in a  5 9 billion pre tax gain for Citi  he estimated  
The Fed  in Mayo s view  set a precedent for Corbat to distribute Banamex proceeds  when it approved buybacks by KeyCorp  N KEY  following the sale of an asset management business ",2016-09-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump's-mexico-plans-reignite-banamex-questions-for-citigroup-426739,426739

204733,426249,KEY,KeyCorp Preparing To Break Out For Value Investors,opinion,"KeyCorp  NYSE KEY  is another of those stocks which value investors may well be eyeing at the moment  as it is another from the list that could be  perceived as cheap   Sometimes there is a reason why stocks are cheap  but in this case  the fundamentals and technicals would suggest otherwise  and with last week s price action now firmly balanced at a significant level  now might be the time to add this one to any watch list 
And the reason for this is easy to see on the weekly chart  Since the early part of the year  the stock has been trading in a relatively narrow range 
However  note how following each reversal lower the stock closes at a higher level each time  The low of 2018 was  13 60  The low of late March at  14 80 and finally the low of late May at  16 00  This in itself is signalling a rising triangle formation with the ceiling of resistance building at  17 84 per share and indeed clearly identified with the accumulation and distribution indicator 
The blue dashed line is relatively wide  denoting this is a strong region which was tested again in last week s price action  With the price now tantalizingly balanced  the journey higher for the stock still has some significant hurdles to overcome 
Nevertheless  this is the starting point for a move away from the volume point of control at  16 80 per share and denoted with the yellow dashed line  So provided the price continues to hold at the volume point of control and break through  18 per share  we should then see an advance to the next level of resistance at  18 50 per share and denoted with the red dashed line where lighter volume awaits on the volume histogram before deeper volume resistance then builds towards  20 per share ",2019-07-03,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/keycorp-preparing-to-breakout-for-value-investors-200436658,200436658
204734,426250,KEY,KeyCorp  KEY  Reports Next Week  What To Expect,opinion,"The market expects KeyCorp  NYSE KEY  to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 44 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  1 62 billion  down 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 63  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for KeyCorp 
For KeyCorp  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 31  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that KeyCorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that KeyCorp would post earnings of  0 42 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 40  delivering a surprise of  4 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
KeyCorp doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/keycorp-key-reports-next-week-what-to-expect-200440185,200440185

204743,426259,KEY,This Is Why KeyCorp  KEY  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
KeyCorp  NYSE KEY  in Focus
Based in Cleveland  KeyCorp  KEY  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 10 49   The bank holding company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 17 per share  with a dividend yield of 4 16   This compares to the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield of 3 17  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 99  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 68 is up 20 4  from last year  Over the last 5 years  KeyCorp has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 20 96   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  KeyCorp s current payout ratio is 42   This means it paid out 42  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  KEY expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  1 89 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 9 25  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  KEY is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-keycorp-key-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200377090,200377090

204748,426264,KEY,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For KeyCorp  KEY ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering KeyCorp  NYSE KEY   which belongs to the Zacks Banks   Major Regional industry 
This bank holding company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3 52  
For the last reported quarter  KeyCorp came out with earnings of  0 45 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 44 per share  representing a surprise of 2 27   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 42 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 44 per share  delivering a surprise of 4 76  
Price and EPS Surprise

For KeyCorp  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
KeyCorp currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 13   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 17  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-keycorp-key-200369160,200369160
204749,426265,KEY,KeyCorp  KEY  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"KeyCorp  NYSE KEY  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 17  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 48 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  45 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 64 billion  up 2 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 58  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for KeyCorp 
For KeyCorp  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 54  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that KeyCorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that KeyCorp would post earnings of  0 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 45  delivering a surprise of  2 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
KeyCorp appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/keycorp-key-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200374492,200374492

Bank stocks have climbed since Donald Trump was elected president as investors bet his pro growth agenda and rising interest rates would help lenders generate huge profits  But this month  executives at some of the country s largest regional banks said customers  especially corporations and small businesses  are instead waiting for details on the new administration s proposals and results before seeking financing for expansion 
Total loans at the 15 largest U S  regional banks declined by about  10 billion to  1 73 trillion in the first quarter  compared with the previous three month period  the first such drop in four years  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  All but two of those banks missed analysts  estimates for total loans  as a slump in commercial and industrial lending sapped growth 
 The optimism and the willingness is there  but it has not yet translated into actions or behaviors   Beth Mooney  chief executive officer of KeyCorp  NYSE KEY   said of the Cleveland based bank s small and middle market business clients   We did not see  flip the switch  sort of behavior that led to loan demand or making different capital decisions or investment decisions  

Nonsensical Statement of the Day
Beth Mooney  chief executive officer of KeyCorp said 

The optimism and the willingness is there  but it has not yet translated into actions or behaviors 

Excuse me for pointing out the obvious  but if willingness was present  there would have been more loans 
Mainstream media and most economists are banking on consumer confidence sentiment  regional manufacturing sentiment  ISM sentiment  and now small business loan sentiment

204809,426325,KEY,Amkor Technologies  Frank s International  JPMorgan Chase  Wells Fargo And KeyCorp Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   August 08  2016    highlightsAmkor Technologies    as the Bull of the Day and  Frank s International    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on   JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM       Wells Fargo   Company  NYSE WFC       and KeyCorp  NYSE KEY     

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

  

	Technology is amazing  complicated  and at times requires several different components to function in tandem to produce the desired effect  Take your smart phone  there are many technologies that work together to enable these phones to do amazing things  batteries  semiconductor chips  and touch screens to name a few of the parts  One such company that does chip packaging and testing for large companies is Amkor Technologies     and they are the Zacks Bull of the Day 

	This Zacks Ranked  1  Strong Buy  company is the world s largest independent provider of semiconductor packaging and test services  Also  the company is one of the leading developers of advanced semiconductor packaging and test technology  The company offers one of the industry s broadest integrated sets of packaging and test services  which are the final procedures necessary to prepare semiconductor devices for further use  Its customers outsource the packaging and testing of semiconductor chips to the company in order to benefit from the expertise in the development and implementation 

Recent Earnings

	Management recently announced Q2 16 earnings where they easily beat both the Zacks Consensus Earnings and Revenue estimates  The company posted year over year gains in Net sales  24 4   and EBITDA  5   AMKR also faced  13 million in recovery costs from earthquakes in Japan  factory in Kumamoto   According to Joanne Solomon  EVP and CFO     We incurred approximately  13 million of incremental earthquake costs that reduced gross margin by 150 basis points and earnings per diluted share by  0 04  Taking into account insurance payments anticipated later this year  we expect the net impact of the Japan earthquakes on our full year 2016 results to be minimal    

Management s Take

	According to Steve Kelley  President and CEO     Second quarter results were above the high end of our guidance  Strong Android smartphone demand and a quicker recovery at our earthquake damaged Kumamoto factory were the key drivers of our financial performance for the quarter  Our growth in sequential sales also drove an 8 1  improvement in EBITDA    

	Mr  Kelley  touched on Q3 expectations as well  stating     Looking ahead to Q3  we expect that revenues will increase around 15  sequentially  driven by the launch of mobile devices across multiple tiers  We expect robust growth in advanced SiP  Greater China and automotive    

 

	In the service industry  if a big section of your clients suddenly don t need as much servicing  it negatively impacts the bottom line  In the case of our Bear of the Day  Frank s International      they saw 22 out of 25 deep water rig clients suspend operations  or even cancelled their drilling operations all together during the second quarter of 2016  Further  the remaining and suspended rigs are now looking for pricing discounts  The combination of both situations has the company expecting to see second half 2016 revenues down 20  from the first half of 2016 

	This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is a provider of engineered tubular services to the oil and gas industry  Its tubular services include the handling and installation of multiple joints of pipe to establish a cased wellbore  and the installation of smaller diameter pipe inside a cased wellbore to provide a conduit for produced oil and gas to reach the surface  The Company provides its services to exploration and production companies in both offshore and onshore environments  with a focus on complex and technically demanding wells 

Recent Earnings

	Management recently reported Q2 16 results where they missed both the Zacks Consensus Earnings and Revenue estimates by a wide margin  On a year over year basis  the company saw declines in overall revenues  52  with International Services revenues down  53   U S  Services down  53   and Tubular Sales falling  50   Further  the company posted a net loss of  45 million  and adjusted EBITDA fell by  14 million in the second quarter 2016  Due to the poor performance in the quarter  and the difficult road ahead  management cut their quarterly dividend by 50  in order to lower costs and improve cash flow  according to management 

Management s Take

	According to Gary Luquette  President and CEO     Although global offshore rig count was down slightly during the quarter  our offshore tubular running services business was adversely impacted as a majority of rigs that exited the market were serviced by Frank s and located in our two primary regions of West Africa and the U S  Gulf of Mexico  

As we continue to navigate this difficult macro environment the Company remains focused on growing share in underrepresented markets  continuing its lean journey through Frank s Business System and evaluating opportunities to diversify our product and service offerings  We believe these efforts will position Frank s well for the eventual upcycle

Bank Stock Roundup

Due to the commencement of the Q2 earnings season  all eyes were on the banking sector over the last five trading sessions  Like the past few quarters  earnings expectations for the sector are not encouraging 
	However  JPMorgan Chase   Co     proved analysts wrong by reporting an earnings beat on July 14  In fact  its results helped the financial stocks rallying in the trading session  Now  it is to be seen whether other banks can also impress the market 
	Overall  the sector continues to face challenges related to global growth worries  lower demand for loans  ambiguity over the timing of the next Fed rate hike  low levels of client activities and volatility in oil prices  Further  the Brexit fallout also adds to the concerns
