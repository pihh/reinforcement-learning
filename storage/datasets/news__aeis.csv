revenues improved 3 9  year over year to  55 2 million  31 5  of revenues   Contributions from Artesyn Embedded Power acquisition remained positive  Further  motor drive design win drove the revenues further  Additionally  solid performance of the company s portfolio of high and low voltage power supplies in the medical imaging and diagnostic market contributed to revenues  However  weak demand for automotive and industrial applications  manufacturing contraction in Europe  and increased pricing pressure in the solar market is likely to continue weighing on margins Telecom   Networking

25407,246922,AEIS,Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Canon  Advanced Energy Industries  Inphi And Skyworks Solutions Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 18  2019    Shares of Jazz Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ JAZZ   as the Bull of the Day  Canon   NYSE CAJ   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Advanced Energy Industries  Inc    NASDAQ AEIS    Inphi Corp    NYSE IPHI   and Skyworks Solutions  Inc    NASDAQ SWKS   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  The stock market is en fuego right now  It seems like every stock is breaking out to all time highs  It s times like this when investors can lose sight of what makes money over the long run  Stocks with the strongest earnings do the best over time  One way to find stocks with strong earnings trends is by leaning on the time tested power of the Zacks Rank  Today s Bull of the Day is one of those stocks I m talking about Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc  a biopharmaceutical company  identifies  develops  and commercializes pharmaceutical products for various unmet medical needs in the United States  Europe  and internationally  The company has a portfolio of products and product candidates with a focus in the areas of sleep and hematology oncology  Its lead marketed products include Xyrem  an oral solution for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness  EDS  in adult and pediatric patients with narcolepsy  Erwinaze to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia  Defitelio for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with hepatic veno occlusive disease  a potentially life threatening complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  and Vyxeos liposome for injection  a product for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed therapy related acute myeloid leukemia The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank lies in estimate revisions coming from analysts around Wall Street  Over the last thirty days  seven analysts have increased their estimates for the current quarter  while ten have done so for the current year  The bullish moves have pushed up the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current quarter from  3 71 to  4 03 while current year consensus is up from  14 98 to  15 81 Those estimates have helped spark a rally in Jazz Pharmaceuticals  The stock bottomed out under  120 in mid October  Since then  shares have rallied dramatically with the stock closing all the way up at  138 64 on Friday November 15th  The top stocks are often found top industries  It makes sense because if the whole industry is doing well  individual companies are likely to experience the same tail winds as other companies within that industry  At the same time  stocks in industries which are struggling can face headwinds that make it very hard to consistently deliver profits  Today s Bear of the Day is a stock that s in a struggling industry Today s Bear of the Day is Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Canon  Canon Inc  manufactures and sells office multifunction devices  MFDs   plain paper copying machines  laser and inkjet printers  cameras  diagnostic equipment  and lithography equipment  The company operates through four segments  Office Business Unit  Imaging System Business Unit  Medical System Business Unit  and Industry and Others Business Unit Canon is in the Office Automation and Equipment industry that currently ranks in the Bottom 4  of our Zacks Industry Rank  The stock itself is a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   The reason for the unfavorable rank stems from the series of negative estimate revisions coming from analysts  Over the last ninety days  two analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the current year and next year  The bearish moves have made a negative impact on our Zacks Consensus Estimates  The current year estimate has come down from  1 55 to  1 28 while next year s number is off from  1 73 down to  1 64 The negative estimates have made an impact on the stock price  Canon was trading near  40 in early 2018  That was before estimates started coming down  A quick look at the Price and Consensus Chart shows estimates going in a negative direction since then  It should come as no surprise that the stock has been tumbling since then  Lately  there s been a bit of divergence  Over the last few months  CAJ has rallied from  25 to nearly  28  At the same time  estimates have continued to fall  That is troubling sign for long term holders of the stock Additional content 3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy After Strong

company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 2 2  Which Way Are Q3 Estimates Treading For third quarter 2019  AMD expects revenues to be roughly  1 8 billion      50 million   up almost 18  sequentially and 9  year over year The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings is pegged at 18 cents per share  unchanged over the last 30 days  The figure indicates an improvement of 38 5  from the year ago quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at  1 8 billion  suggesting growth of 9 1  from the year ago reported figure Notably  AMD s stock has returned 79 9  in the past one year  outperforming the  s rally of 33 3  Q2 at a GlanceAMD had reported second quarter 2019 non GAAP earnings of 8 cents per share  which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the figure declined 42 9  year over year Revenues of  1 531 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 524 billion  However  the top line

uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  AMD currently carries a Zacks Rank  2 Factors at PlayAMD has been making every effort to strengthen its GPU portfolio with new capabilities in a bid to provide gamers with superior graphic performance and high quality visual experiences  These initiatives are likely to reflect on the third quarter performance The company stated that Ryzen and EPYC processors and data center GPU revenues more than doubled on a year over year basis in the last reported quarter  a trend that is likely to have continued in the third quarter Notably  AMD recently rolled out its new Radeon RX 5500 Series designed to deliver smooth gameplay in 1080p Notably  the company has also introduced Radeon RX 5500M GPU with 7nm technology for notebook PCs  The new line of GPUs includes several technologies  including Radeon Image Sharpening  AMD FidelityFX and Radeon Anti Lag The company s move to improve its processor portfolio strengthens competitive position against the likes of NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA    We believe AMD s portfolio strength is likely to have helped in expanding customer base and consequently the top line in the third quarter The company also announced latest lineup of Ryzen PRO 3000 Series desktop processors  With the aid of these products  AMD has been foraying into the high end graphics card market  Consequently  if the latest GPU has been able to cater to the rising demand of users  then the impact is likely to get reflected in the company s third quarter revenues Moreover  the third quarter performance is likely to reflect strong adoption of EPYC server processors  Notably  increasing adoption of AI techniques and ML tools in industries like gaming  automotive and blockchain are primarily responsible for driving GPU demand  The third quarter results are likely to have benefited from this demand  with the company launching new graphics cards We believe that ongoing GPU roll outs  deal wins and product enhancements are likely to have bolstered the incremental adoption of AMD s offerings  and consequently the top line in the third quarter However  a highly leveraged balance sheet is anticipated to get reflected in the third quarter results Key DevelopmentsThe company introduced its first 7 nanometer Navi gaming GPUs Moreover  AMD had entered into a strategic partnership with Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co   Ltd  with an aim to bring immersive graphics experience to smartphone users  Per the terms of the multi year agreement  AMD s high performance Radeon graphics solutions and technologies will be integrated with Samsung s SoCs to enhance mobile applications AMD also rolled out the latest Xbox Game Pass to PC gamers  by which the players will be able to access more than 100 PC games for three months with the purchases of selected products of AMD  We believe the extension of Xbox Game Pass to PCs will enable AMD to strengthen

25914,247429,AEIS,Rent A Center  Advanced Energy  Target  TJX And Deere Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 19  2018    highlights Rent A Center   NASDAQ RCII   as the Bull of the Day  Advanced Energy Industries   NASDAQ AEIS   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Target Corporation   NYSE TGT    The TJX Companies  Inc    NYSE TJX   and Deere   Company   NYSE DE   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Rent A Center is the stock that has been on the Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  list for the longest amount of time   The stock has been a  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  since July 31 and that is saying something   August and September were relatively good months  but staying strong throughout October and midway through November is something else   RCII is finally the Bull of the Day DescriptionA rent to own industry leader  Plano  Texas based  Rent A Center  Inc   is focused on improving the quality of life for its customers by providing them the opportunity to obtain ownership of high quality  durable products such as consumer electronics  appliances  computers  furniture  and accessories  under flexible rental purchase agreements with no long term obligation  Rent A Center Franchising International  Inc   a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company  is a national franchiser of the rent to own stores operating under the trade names of Rent A Center  ColorTyme and RimTyme Earnings HistoryOne reason RCII has been a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  for the last 3 and a half months is that it has posted back to back beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate   It helps that these beats came after some pretty big misses   The misses were negative earnings surprises of 200  and 485  Earnings EstimatesYou would think that being a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  for all that time would mean you have some pretty strong estimate revisions   RCII has some moves  but they are not as strong as I thought they would be The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate moved from  0 72 to  0 84 over the last 90 days  which is really good  but not over the top great The 2019 Zacks Consensus Estimate has more or less stood still over that same time period   It kicked higher by one cent  and is now at  1 23 The implied earnings growth is nice to see  but that isn t a big factor in the Zacks Rank ValuationThe valuation for RCII is pretty good  with a 17x forward PE and price to book multiple below 3x at 2 7x   Revenue growth is struggling    but with the idea of a higher minimum wage  you have to think that growth is on the way for a play like this  Advanced Energy Industries is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and is in a sector that has been weak and looks to be getting weaker   Poor earnings reports from a few bigger chip stocks last week make it hard for analysts to get optimistic about raising estimates   That could keep this stock a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  for a while and that made me select is as the Bear of the Day DescriptionAdvanced Energy is a global leader in the development and support of technologies critical to high technology  high growth manufacturing processes used in the production of semiconductors  flat panel displays  data storage products  solar cells  architectural glass  and other advanced product applications Leveraging a diverse product portfolio and technology leadership  Advanced Energy creates solutions that maximize process impact  improve productivity and lower the cost of ownership for its customers  This portfolio includes a comprehensive line of technology solutions in power  flow  thermal management  and plasma and ion beam sources for original equipment manufacturers and end users around the world Advanced Energy operates in regional centers in North America  Asia and Europe and offers global sales and support through direct offices  representatives and distributors Earnings HistoryWhen I see a stock with a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  I expect to see a lot of earnings misses   With AEIS  I see 3 beats and 1 miss in the last four reports That isn t what you should expect to see from a Bear of the Day Estimate RevisionsAEIS does not have any positive earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days   They do  however  have 6 negative revisions for this quarter  next quarter  this year and next year The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has moved from  4 76 to  4 46 over the last 90 days   An even bigger move can be seen in the 2019 Zacks Consensus Estimate   That number moved from  5 33 to  4 42 Those movements are the primary reason this stock has slid to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and is now the Bear of the Day Additional content Upcoming Earnings to Watch  TGT  TJX  DEStocks

25930,247445,AEIS,Is Applied Materials  AMAT  The Best Semiconductor Value Stock ,opinion,"Investors in search of great value opportunities in the semiconductor industry might look no further than Applied Materials   NASDAQ AMAT    This Silicon Valley giant is one of the top suppliers of equipment to the global semiconductor business  and with the rise in demand for high end chips throughout the world  AMAT has seen its client activity pick up significantly 
In its most recent quarter  Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of  1 06 per share  up 59  from the year ago period  Total quarterly revenues came in at  4 2 billion  improving more than 28  year over year 
It is not often that companies with AMAT s size and legacy see such rapid expansion  And investors have certainly noticed this growth  sending the stock soaring more than 60  over the past year  Still  there appears to be plenty of room left for Applied to run higher 
One catalyst for a continued surge could be the company s improving outlook  Within the past 60 days  we have seen seven positive revisions for AMAT s full year earnings estimates  bringing our Zacks Consensus Estimate a whopping 31 cents higher over that timeframe  We now expect to see the company witness full year earnings growth of 35  
Even with the stock s recent surge  AMAT s positive outlook makes its forward looking guidance extremely attractive for value investors  What s more  the stock is also trading at a discount to its most comparable peers 
Here s Applied s Forward P E trend compared to that of its peer group 
AMAT s peer group includes ASML Holding   NASDAQ ASML    Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX    KLA Tencor   NASDAQ KLAC    and Advanced Energy Industries   NASDAQ AEIS    Not all of these companies are direct competitors to AMAT  but they do function as suppliers to semiconductor manufacturers  Comparing AMAT to these stocks helps us show how investors tend to value this niche market 
When we break it down like this  we can really see that AMAT is an interesting value option  However  we should note that the stock is only sporting a  C  grade for Value in our Style Scores system  In contrast to its attractive P E  AMAT s P S of 3 9 is less appealing than the broader market  Applied might also raise eyebrows from a cash flow perspective  as it is only generating about  3 69 in cash per share right now about 40  less than its industry s average 
Still  the foundation of AMAT s is only getting stronger right now  and the stock s Forward P E implies that investors are getting a great price for that strength

26016,247531,AEIS,Can Strong Memory Save Lam Research  LRCX  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Lam Research Corporation   NASDAQ LRCX   is slated to report second quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 24  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5 81  
The surprise history has been good in Lam s case  The company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 5 3  
The company s shares have charted a solid trajectory in recent times  increasing 84  in the last year  outperforming the  s gain of 68 2  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Lam Research has high exposure to the memory segment  which is likely to witness strong growth in the coming quarters  The strength is driven by cloud computing  big data  mobile devices and IoT 
The company is doing well and expects to succeed in areas such as device architecture  process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections 
The company also continues to witness increased adoption rates for 3D NAND technology  FinFETs and multi patterning  The company has undertaken cost reduction activities and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies  All these factors could positively impact the top line figure of the company 
For the upcoming quarter  the company expects revenues of approximately  2 55 billion       100 million   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  2 56 billion  Shipments are projected to be roughly  2 60 billion       100 million   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  2 61 billion 
However  volatility in the PC market remains a major concern  The weakness in the PCs could offset the expansion in the 3D NAND  impacting the upcoming results 
Also  the company faces significant competition in all its product and service categories in the semiconductor capital equipment market 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lam Research is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP The Most Accurate estimate stands at  3 66 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at  3 67  Hence  the difference is  0 27   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Also Lamhas a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which when combined with a  0 27  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Stocks to Consider
You could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank 
Applied Materials  Inc    NASDAQ AMAT    with an Earnings ESP of  0 57  and Zacks Rank  2  You can see 
Western Digital Corp    NASDAQ WDC    with an Earnings ESP of  0 83  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Advanced Energy Industries  Inc    NASDAQ AEIS    with an Earnings ESP of  0 41  and a Zacks Rank  3

26124,247639,AEIS,5 Of The Most Efficient Stocks To Boost Your Portfolio,opinion,Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions  This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks  These efficiency ratios are Inventory Turnover  The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a four quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales  which resulted in excess inventory  Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers Asset Utilization  This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four quarter average of total assets  Like the above ratios  high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient Operating Margin  This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank  2  Buy  to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable  You can see  Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers      The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 906 stocks to only 14 Here are five stocks from the 14 that made it through the screen Chemed Corporation   NYSE CHE   provides hospice and palliative care services in the United States  It operates through two segments  VITAS and Roto Rooter  The company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 5 9

26174,247689,AEIS,3D Systems  DDD  Q2 Earnings Lag Estimates  Guidance Bleak ,opinion,3D Systems Corporation s   NYSE DDD   posted another huge earnings miss   its second after the last quarter s huge miss ended its streak of three back to back quarters of impressive beats  The company reported adjusted loss  including share based compensation expense  of 7 cents per share for second quarter 2017  which was way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 6 cents Non GAAP earnings came in at 8 cents per share  plunging 33 3  from the prior year quarter figure of 12 cents  as modest top line growth was more than offset by a rise in operating expenses In light of weaker than expected results  the company s management tweaked the full year 2017 guidance lower Inside the HeadlinesThe 3D printer maker reported revenues of  159 5 million  reflecting a year over year increase of 0 9   Strong demand for the company s healthcare solutions  along with steady demand for the industrial offerings was largely offset by lower revenues from professional printers  The company also saw growth in production printers  materials  software and healthcare revenues  but lower sales in APAC restricted top line growth  Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  163 million by a small margin 3D Systems  Healthcare revenues were up 25  to  48 5 million year over year  primarily attributable to high demand for printers and materials from medical and dental customers  Software revenues totaled  24 million  up 9  on a year over year basis Materials revenue rose 8  to  43 9 million  thanks to strong production orders and robust contribution from the previously acquired Vertex Global  The company s Printer revenues were down 14  to  28 million  while on demand manufacturing decreased 5  to  26 million In the quarter  gross margin contracted 30 basis points on a year over year basis to 50 6   The company plans to drive further reductions in cost of sales from supply chain betterment initiatives and manufacturing improvements  in order to drive margins higher In addition  the company s operating expenses flared up  up 4   to  87 5 million  as R D expense rose 17  year over year  mainly on account of a rise in focused investments in production application solutions  including Figure 4  metals and materials Notable DevelopmentsDuring the first quarter  3D Systems had rolled out a next generation additive manufacturing platform  based on the company s Figure 4 technology and NextDent materials  The company believes that the new platform will bring down cost of operations  reduce fabrication times and produce far less material waste In the second quarter  3D Systems launched the Simbionix SPINE Mentor  a hands on simulated training and practice tool for minimally invasive spine surgeries  The company also released new products  materials and capabilities at RAPID   TCT 2017 to accelerate its leadership in plastic additive manufacturing 3D Systems Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Products included the new ProJet MJP 5600  offering print speeds up to two times faster  a larger build volume  and part costs that are up to 40 percent less than competing multi material 3D printers The company also rolled out VisiJet CR BK  a new rigid black plastic material for the ProJet MJP 5600 that enables producers to meet the most demanding product designs and models Also  during the quarter  3D Systems and United Therapeutics joined forces to develop solid organ scaffolds for human transplants  The multi year collaboration will integrate 3D Systems  profound healthcare printing and precision expertise with the regenerative medicine and organ manufacturing capabilities of United Therapeutics Corporation Cash Flow and Balance Sheet3D Systems ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  154 million  down significantly from  184 9 million as at Dec 1  2016  At the end of June  net cash generated from operating activities came in at  18 4 million  significantly lower than the year ago figure of  31 million GuidanceConcurrent with the second quarter 2017 earnings release  the company revised its guidance for full year 2017  3D Systems now anticipates revenues in the range of  643  671 million  which would reflect year over year growth of 2 6  in 2017  earlier projection   643  684 million  In addition  the company expects to report GAAP loss per share of around 14 cents for 2017  compared to prior expectations of GAAP earnings of 2 6 cents per share   while non GAAP earnings are now expected to be approximately 46 cents per share  earlier projection  51 55 cents per share  To Conclude3D Systems  year over year bottom line improvements during second quarter 2017 are attributable to a host of factors  including solid momentum of healthcare offerings  robust demand for production printers and materials  and higher efficiency in  demand manufacturing services   We believe the acquisition of Vertex Global Holding B V will unlock multiple opportunities for the billion dollar digital dentistry space The company is banking on continued double digit growth in healthcare and sustained growth in software and materials to drive 2017 growth  Even on demand manufacturing and printer revenues are likely to return to growth Also  the company s efforts to streamline its cost structure by focusing on IT infrastructure  go to market and innovation are likely to stoke growth  In addition  the company remains bullish about the prospects of Figure 4 technology   the ultra fast  modular Stereolithography system   designed for the production of plastic parts on the factory floor Despite these positives  3D Systems  broader market concerns have thwarted growth of the premium 3D printing company  The industry is battling a widespread decline in demand for enterprise 3D printers over the past two years  Other headwinds  including economic slowdown  inflation  currency

26175,247690,AEIS,Nikon  NINOY  Q1 Earnings Fall Y Y  Revenues Remain Soft,opinion,Nikon Corporation s   OTC NINOY   first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings declined significantly over the comparable quarter last fiscal  as the company generated a net profit of  8 9 billion   80 7 million  compared with profit of 14 7 billion last year  Earnings per share came in at 22 37  down 39 7  year over year Operating income too decreased 31 1  year over year to  12 4 billion   65 1 million  Inside the HeadlinesIn the quarter  Nikon s net sales inched up 0 6  year over year to  170 3 billion   1 5 billion   The top line was positively impacted by increase in unit sales from FPD and Semiconductor lithography  which was somewhat offset by soft digital camera sales  change in product mix of new DSLRs and delayed budget execution by governments Sales for the Precision Equipment Business climbed 6 6  year over year to  55 2 billion   500 7 million  The unit enjoyed remarkable growth in the FPD Lithography System field  which benefited from the broad based strength in capital investments  However  operating income at the segment fell to  13 1 billion compared to  14 8 billion in the prior year quarter due to lower unit sales in the FPD Lithography System field However  the Imaging Products Business witnessed a steady decline in both sales and profits  as the top line edged down 0 8  over first quarter fiscal 2017 to  90 9 billion   824 6 million   The unit saw a turnaround in the shrinking digital camera market  as the compact digital camera market improved year over year  Operating income at the segment also fell to  7 6 billion  down 24 8  from  10 1 billion in the year ago period  due to adverse product mix The Instruments Business displayed nearly flat growth  with the top line coming in at  13 5 billion   122 5 million   up from sales of  13 4 billion recorded last quarter  The microscope related field s performance was weak due to delayed budget execution by the U S  and China governments and other factors  and adverse foreign currency translation impact further hampered revenues  However  in the industrial metrology field  the company recorded improved sales in the U S  and Asia  The segment recorded an operating loss of  2 4 billion compared with a loss of  1 2 billion in the prior fiscal quarter  due to higher upfront investments and expenses related to sales expansion initiatives The new Medical Business posted sales of  4 7 billion   42 6 million  in the quarter  up from  4 2 billion recorded in the year ago period  Optos Plc s retinal diagnostic imaging equipment exhibited solid performance in North America  which drove revenues This segment also recorded an operating loss of  1 1 billion  slightly wider than the  0 6 billion loss in the prior year quarter  hurt by upfront investments Lastly  the Other Businesses segment net sales grew 9 4  year over year at  5 8 billion   52 6 million  Liquidity   Cash FlowAs of Jun 30  2017  Nikon s cash and cash equivalents were  309 2 billion   2 8 billion   down from  319 1 billion recorded on Mar 31  2017 Long term liabilities  which include Bonds and Long term loans  totaled  137 7 billion   1 2 billion   marginally down from  138 3 billion a year ago Nikon Corp  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Restructuring PlanIn third quarter fiscal 2017  Nikon unveiled a plan to undertake company wide structural reform  as it seeks to enhance its operational profitability and create value The restructuring will help Nikon shift from a strategy pursuing revenue growth to one pursuing profit improvement The restructuring was prompted by the fact that Nikon has not been able to derive value from its existing businesses  The company s Semiconductor Lithography Business Imaging Product business is still not profitable  while the Imaging Product Business has been grappling with a shrinking market and foreign exchange headwinds In light of the above  Nikon planned to discontinue the current  Medium Term Management Plan Update   Instead  it has initiated a company wide restructuring to help shift to a strategy which pursues profit growth instead of revenue growth The plan includes reassessment of the strategy of the Semiconductor Lithography and Imaging Product Businesses  Additionally  Nikon intends to optimize manufacturing  sales and R D on a global basis and streamline   optimize its workforce  As part of the initiative  Nikon stated it will be declaring a voluntary retirement program for about 1 000 employees Extraordinary losses due to the restructuring came to about  49 8 billion and were booked in the fiscal year ending Mar 31  2017 GuidanceThe company sees a gradual recovery trend in its end markets as both the U S  and Europe enjoy steady personal consumption  after much turmoil in the aftermath of the UK s decision to exit from the EU  as well as the U S  presidential election  Japan s capital investment and personal consumption also seem to be on the road to recovery Incorporating the present market scenario  Nikon reiterated its forecast for fiscal 2018  The company expects net sales to come at around  700 billion  Also  the guidance for operating profits is about  45 billion Nikon anticipates strong capital investments in the semiconductor related field  which will drive growth in the Precision Equipment Business  Sales in the Imaging Products Business are likely to be better than the earlier projections  led by an increase in unit sales of digital cameras and interchangeable lenses  The instruments businessis also contending with deferred government budget spending and restrained investments  which might mar sales Our TakeNikon has been suffering in recent times as its chip making equipment business has been underperforming  as it struggles with slowing demand and stiff competition with overseas rivals  Further  adverse foreign exchange impact and supply disruptions caused by the Kumamoto earthquakes in Apr 2016 further dented operations for this company In order to drive growth  the Japanese precision instrument maker aims to downsize low profitable operations and instead focus resources on medical equipment and other promising businesses Nikon s growth blueprint is based on four initiatives   a merger   acquisition program  research   development program  human resource program and cost reduction program Nikon is focusing on expansion in two new segments  namely Medical and Instruments business  Also  the company is undertaking a number of initiatives to stabilize the key financials of its core business areas   including Precision Equipment and Imaging Products  In addition  Nikon s strategic acquisitions and investments to build its medical business

  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  NASDAQ   NASDAQ VRTX      and Sanderson Farms  Inc   NASDAQ   NASDAQ SAFM      5 Top Efficient Stocks to Buy for a Winning PortfolioEfficiency  the ability to transform inputs into outputs  is a potential indicator of a company s financial health  Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions  This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance Ratios to Evaluate Efficiency LevelsWe have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  The receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio may indicate that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio may signal that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater is the possibility that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio may signal that it is failing to use its assets effectively Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have ratios higher than their respective industry averages Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average   Higher value of these ratios than the industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is greater than its peers     The use of these criteria has narrowed down the universe of around 7 887 stocks to only 18  Here are the top five stocks Farmers   Merchants Bancorp Inc NASDAQ      operates as a bank holding company for The Farmers   Merchants State Bank that

26238,247753,AEIS,ViaSat  VSAT  Q1 Earnings Fall Y Y On Escalating R D Costs ,opinion,ViaSat Inc  s   NASDAQ VSAT   first quarter fiscal 2018 non GAAP earnings came in at 4 cents  down drastically from the figure of 23 cents recorded in the year ago quarter  Despite posting record first quarter revenues  ViaSat s profits were hurt by escalating research and development costs  and costs related to the ViaSat 2 service launch activities On a GAAP basis  the company actually swung to a net loss of 16 cents per share  in stark contrast to earnings of 4 cents recorded in the year ago period Inside the HeadlinesThe company posted revenues of  380 million in the fiscal first quarter  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  387 million  However  revenues rose 4 7  compared to the prior year quarter tally  and were at a record high for the fiscal first quarter  Terrific growth in government business drove top line growth  which was somewhat offset by contraction in Commercial Networks revenues New contract awards  up 31 4  to  441 8 million  grew sharply in the quarter  driving impressive backlog  and highlighting strong demand for both products and services Segment wise  Satellite Services revenues were nearly flat  down 0 1  year over year  at  152 2 million  The segment witnessed strong revenue growth in commercial air  along with higher consumer broadband revenues  Particularly  growth of Average Revenue per User  ARPU  in ViaSat s residential broadband internet business grew 11  year over year Commercial Networks revenues continued to be strained  plunging 31  on a year over year basis to  45 2 million  dragged bylower fixed terminal sales for Australia s nbn satellite broadband service This segment continues to witness an increase in research and development investment  up 67  year over year  associated with internal development of the ViaSat 3 project and expansion of next gen mobility solutions On the other hand  Government Systems reported impressive revenues of  182 6 million  up 25 8  year over year  driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical datalink products  government mobility platforms and satellite communications solutions  Impressive growth in revenues drove record operating profit  up 82  year over year  and Adjusted EBITDA  up 51  year over year  for the quarter During the quarter  sales backlog climbed 18 9  year over year to a record  1 085 8 million  driven largely by a robust backlog at Government Systems segment However  adjusted EBIDTA plunged 23 7  from the comparable quarter last year to  61 2 million  dragged by start up costs associated with the ViaSat 2 network  and planned rapid growth in in flight connectivity based on installing existing backlog ViaSat  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Quarterly HighlightsThe company launched ViaSat 2 satellite in the quarter successfully  ViaSat 2  touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage  is a massive improvement over ViaSat 1 Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat 1 include high capacity connectivity  smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways  ViaSat believes that these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular internet access points  delivering greater network reliability and security ViaSat maintains a leading position in the satellite and wireless communications market  The company has garnered enough economics of scale and scope to serve vast emerging markets in South America  Africa  the Middle East and Western Asia  ViaSat 2 services are expected to begin in fourth quarter fiscal 2018 The company has also been investing in the next generation of ViaSat 3 class satellites   which will provide even more bandwidth globally from satellites slated to launch starting in 2019 LiquidityViaSat exited the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of  160 6 million compared with  130 1 million as of Mar 31  2017  The company also generated record levels of operating cash flow in the fiscal first quarter  which hit  153 7 million To ConcludeViaSat posted mixed results for the quarter  but set multiple records  Strong backlog levels  robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential  in flight  and government markets are likely to accelerate the company s growth momentum  In addition  the just launched ViaSat 2 satellite is likely to help the company fortify its foothold in new geographic markets Despite these positives  escalating research and development costs remain a major concern for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company in the near term  Further  the company s satellite services segment is highly affected by seasonality of demand due to traditional retail selling periods Despite such headwinds  increasing adoption of satellite networking  in flight Wi Fi services in commercial aircraft data links and encryption product based businesses are expected to drive the company s long term growth  We also believe the collaboration with Eutelsat is a strategic fit for ViaSat to embark on a global expansion drive Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the broader sector include Lam Research Corporation   NASDAQ LRCX    Advanced Energy Industries  Inc

26239,247754,AEIS,ViaSat s Government Prospects Bright  Huge Expenses A Drag,opinion,Much has been happening with ViaSat Inc    NASDAQ VSAT   in recent times  The company recently launched the ViaSat 2 satellite  which has immense prospects  Just a couple of days ago  ViaSat released disappointing earnings numbers for first quarter of fiscal 2018  The company s shares too have trended badly  having fallen 19 1  over the past one year  much worse than the  s average decline of 2 9   Escalating research and development costs  and costs related to the ViaSat 2 service launch activities badly affected profits  However  fundamentals of the business look quite strong  New contract awards for the company  up 31 4  to  441 8 million  grew sharply in the fiscal first quarter  driving impressive backlog  and highlighting strong demand for both products and services ViaSat s Government Systems business has been outstanding  and has been gaining even greater momentum  which should reflect well on the quarters to come The segment reported impressive revenue growth of 25 8  year over year in the fiscal first quarter  driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical datalink products  government mobility platforms and satellite communications solutions  Splendid growth in revenues drove record operating profit  up 82  year over year  and Adjusted EBITDA  up 51  year over year  for the quarter In flight connectivity is also sustaining robust growth momentum  ViaSat is already connecting nearly 3 million devices a month on its existing fleet of 568 aircraft  The Commercial Air business will likely prove to be a key profit driver in the quarters to come ViaSat maintains a leading position in the satellite and wireless communications market  The company has garnered enough economics of scale and scope to serve vast emerging markets in South America  Africa  the Middle East and Western Asia  ViaSat 2 services are expected to begin in fourth quarter fiscal 2018 ViaSat  Inc  Price and Consensus   The company successfully rolled out ViaSat 2 satellite in June  ViaSat 2  touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage  is a massive improvement over ViaSat 1 Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat 1 include high capacity connectivity  smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways  ViaSat believes that these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular internet access points  delivering greater network reliability and security Lately  ViaSat s earnings have suffered quite a lot due to R D expenses  but per the company  total R D investments are set to peak this fiscal year  The primary drivers are the ViaSat 3 payload  pre flight development and testing  and commercial in flight connectivity  STCs and line fit activity  This indicates that we can see more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters  Also  the costs related to the ViaSat 2 service launch activities and preparations for the large scale in flight Wi Fi ramp are expected to further burden the bottom line Also  stiff competition in the industry proves to be a major growth deterrent for the company  particularly for its satellite services segment  The business is also highly affected by seasonality of demand due to traditional retail selling periods Strong backlog levels  robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential  in flight  and government markets are likely to accelerate the company s growth momentum  In addition  the just launched ViaSat 2 satellite is likely to help this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company fortify its foothold in new geographic markets Overall  while we acknowledge that ViaSat has a robust foothold in numerous markets and is enjoying strong growth momentum  we feel its earnings are set up for more pressure in the quarters ahead Stocks to ConsiderA few better ranked stocks in the broader sector include Lam Research Corporation   NASDAQ LRCX    Advanced Energy Industries  Inc    NASDAQ AEIS   and Applied Materials  Inc    NASDAQ AMAT

Amazon has been strengthening its presence across the globe  To date  it has created millions of full time jobs and continues to hire manpower to meet growing customer demand 
We feel  Amazon must maintain its U S  market share while expanding globally to retain its leading position  For this  the company needs  to invest more in fulfillment as well as technology and content  especially in international markets with less penetration and higher growth rates 
Though increased expenses may hurt the company s bottom line in the near term  we believe this is necessary for the company to maintain its dominance in this highly competitive market

26339,247854,AEIS,5 Efficient Stocks To Buy For Superlative Returns,opinion,"Investors seeking impressive returns irrespective of market conditions may consider adding stocks with favorable efficiency levels to their portfolios  Efficiency is a measure of a company s potential to convert its available input into output  Different studies have shown that there is a direct relationship between a company s efficiency level and its price movement  So investing in efficient companies may prove to be profitable 
How to Measure Efficiency 
There are a number of ratios to measure how efficiently a company utilizes its assets and liabilities to produce outputs  In this article  we have considered four popular efficiency ratios to select efficient companies 
Inventory Turnover  The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory is considered to be one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is suffering from weak sales  which resulted in excess inventory  
Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers 
Asset Utilization  This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert its assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4 quarter average of total assets  Like the above two ratios  high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient 
Operating Margin  Efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control its operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers 
As efficiency level varies across different industries  it is best to select those stocks that have higher ratios compared to their industries  Along with higher ratios  we have considered only those stocks that have either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  in order to make the strategy more profitable 
Screening Parameters
Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers      
Zacks Rankless than or equal to  2  Buy  Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  
The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 700stocks to only 22 
Here are five stocks from the 22 that made it through the screen

26348,247863,AEIS,Buy These 5 Efficient Stocks For Thanksgiving,opinion,"A portfolio that comprises companies with favorable efficiency levels is poised to generate alluring returns  Efficiency   a company s ability to transform its inputs into outputs   is a potential indicator of a company s financial health  As the efficiency level of a company has a significant impact on its price performance  investing in companies with an impressive level of efficiency may prove to be a wise decision ahead of Thanksgiving Day  
Ratios to Evaluate Efficiency Levels
We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive return 
Inventory Turnover
Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory 
Receivables Turnover
This ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  The receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio may indicate that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio may signal that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy 
Asset Utilization
This is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater the possibility is that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio may signal that it is failing to use its assets effectively 
Operating Margin
Another popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses 
All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have these ratios higher than their respective industry averages 
Screening Parameters
In addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable 
Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers      
Zacks Rankless than or equal to  2 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  
The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 20 
Here are five stocks from the 20 that made it through the screen 
Electronic Arts Inc    NASDAQ EA   develops  markets  publishes  and distributes games  content  and services for consoles  personal computers  mobile phones  and tablets worldwide  This Zacks Rank  1 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 29 9

While backtesting over a two year timeframe  Nov 14  2014 to Nov 11  2016   considering a four week holding period  a portfolio following this strategy provided a total return of 22 5  compared with the S P 500 s return of 5 7   Thus  this strategy may prove to be profitable for investors seeking healthy returns

26378,247893,AEIS,MKS Instruments  MKSI  Down To Hold On Macro Headwinds,opinion,"On Sep 27  2016  Zacks Investment Research downgraded MKS Instruments  Inc    NASDAQ MKSI   to a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  from a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Going by the Zacks model  companies carrying a Zacks Rank  3 have chances of performing in line with the broader market over the next quarters 
Why the Downgrade 
MKS Instruments has been facing a number of headwinds in the international business forum  Appreciation of U S  currency is weighing over the company s international revenues and margins  This is because a stronger U S  dollar raises the competitive power of the smaller rivals operating in low cost nations 
Moreover  lackluster performance of booming economies such as Brazil  China and Russia has also been hurting the company s foreign sales  We even believe that rise in political uncertainty due to the Brexit referendum has increased revenue and margin loss risks for MKS Instruments   
Also  severe threats of business rivalry within the global technology industry might lower the market share of the company in the near term  MKS Instruments incurs heavy innovation investments for boosting its competency within the industry  However  such expenses might turn unproductive  if the newly invented technology becomes obsolete 
We believe that the company can partially offset the impact of the above mentioned headwinds by generating higher sales from the semiconductor and other advanced markets  Also  the latest Newport Corporation buyout in Apr 2016 is likely to fortify the company s presence in the Life Sciences  Semiconductor  Research and Industrial markets  This considerably expands its addressable market 
The deal is also expected to provide significant cost synergies to the company in the upcoming 18 36 months  MKS Instruments  Combined Targeted Operating Model is also projected to drive the company s near term growth  
Over the last 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank  3 stock remained unchanged for 2016 and 2017 MKS INSTRUMENTS Price and Consensus

26478,247993,AEIS,5 Fundamentally Sound High Flying Stocks To Fly Higher ,opinion,No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  the equity market volatility will always manage to get some in the end  Only a few lucky ones would rake in the moolah while others fall victim to ad hoc strategies Here we will discuss one tried and tested technique   picking stocks nearing their 52 week highs    as it seldom disappoints when clubbed with the right set of parameters  Why is 52 Week High a Good IndicatorInvesting in stocks that are trading near their 52 week highs bears the risk of falling fast as the market might consider them overvalued  But there is more on the positive side  There may be a broad set of factors including impressive sales  robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects driving the stocks up  Recent major developments may also send these stocks soaring So investing in stocks near their 52 week high is akin to following the momentum strategy  which is based on the understanding that once a trend is established it is likely to continue However  betting on these high flying stocks without a clear investment blueprint may be risky  And for that very reason we ve added a few other parameters to arrive at a foolproof strategy We will screen for stocks which are close to their 52 week highs  but still have strong growth prospects relative to their respective industries  In addition  we ve made sure these stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales With positive momentum in the stock price  blended with strong earnings growth expectations and great value metrics  we believe these stocks will continue their uptrend for quite some time to come A Safe and Sound StrategyCurrent Price 52 Week High     80 This simply measures the ratio between current price to the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading only within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week threshold soon    Change Price   4 Weeks   0 It ensures that the price of the stock has moved north over the past four weeks    Change Price   12 Weeks   0 This metric ensures that the stock has continued its upward price momentum over the past three months we well  Price Sales    XIndMed Lower the ratio  the higher is the benefit for investors as they have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company   P E using F 1  Estimate    XIndMed This metric measures the amount that an investor will invest in a company to obtain one dollar of that company s earnings  This metric narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers  One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0     XIndMed This metric will help in zeroing in on stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism  Zacks Rank   1 No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank  which has proved its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1

26507,248022,AEIS,Bet On These 5 Efficient Stocks To Boost Your Portfolio,opinion,"Efficiency or the company s ability to transform its inputs into outputs is an important measure to determine its financial condition  A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company s price performance  Hence  a portfolio comprising efficient stocks will be ideal for investors who are looking to derive healthy returns irrespective of market conditions   
Measures of Efficiency Level
We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns 
Inventory Turnover
Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory 
Receivables Turnover
This ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy 
Asset Utilization
This is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater the chance is that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively 
Operating Margin
Another popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses 
All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages 
Screening Parameters
In addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable 
Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers      
Zacks Rankless than or equal to  2 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through 
The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 24 
Here are five stocks from the 24 that made it through the screen 
Advanced Energy Industries  Inc    NASDAQ AEIS   is a global leader in the development and support of technologies for production of semiconductors  flat panel displays  data storage products  solar cells  architectural glass  and other advanced product applications  This Zacks Rank  1 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 12 3  
Quidel Corp    NASDAQ QDEL   discovers  develops  manufactures and markets point of care  rapid diagnostic tests for the detection of medical conditions and illnesses  This Zacks Rank  1 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 59 4  
Alarm Com Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ ALRM   offers interactive security solutions for home and business owners  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of more than 100  
Community Bank System Inc    NYSE CBU    the holding company of Community Bank  offers different financial services  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 0 9  
Copart  Inc    NASDAQ CPRT   provides a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles through auctions  principally to licensed dismantlers  rebuilders and used vehicle dealers  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 9  
While backtesting over a two year timeframe  Aug 15  2014 to Aug 19  2016   considering a four week holding period  a portfolio following this strategy provided a total return of 19  compared with the S P 500 s return of 8 6   Thus this strategy may prove to be profitable for investors seeking healthy returns

In the global week ahead  the all important U S  Fed September rate decision arrives on Wednesday  The Bank of Japan will be giving us its updated decisions on its unprecedented negative rate on Wednesday too  A host of other central banks follow up with their rate decisions in the coming week  tagging along with the two big hitters 
On Monday  in advance of that crucial FOMC monetary policy meeting  key interest rates held steady  while stocks in Asia  Europe  and the U S  marked up green buying arrows  A bounce in crude oil prices appeared to send a modest amount of positive sentiment into risk markets 
However  don t read too much into any global risk market trading  until the FOMC September rate decision is in the bag 
Consensus is for no Fed rate hike this time around  With an election in November  the next likely time to see a Fed rate hike is December  On the CME FedWatch tool on Monday  Sept  19th  the probability of a 25 bps Fed rate hike was just 12   Two FOMC members have come out publicly in the last week expressing caution  The last time a FOMC meeting led to a Fed rate hike with 2 dissenters was in 1993 
Given this low a probability of an actual rate hike  the real question is  why do risk markets get held up at all  It s a good question to answer publicly 
The issue is likely not the looming policy rate decision  but the  dot plot  forecast for future rates  and statements made by Chair Yellen in her press conference  FOMC meetings are always done with live ammo  Not getting shot by a stray unforeseen comment    that is what keeps risk markets on their toes

26617,248132,AEIS,IPO Look   Enphase,opinion,Based in Petaluma  California  Enphase Energy  proposed ENPH  scheduled an  80 million IPO with a market capitalization of  375 million at a price range mid point of  11 for Friday  March 30  2012  Managers  Morgan Stanley  BofA  Deutsche Note  as this went to press ENPH cut the mid point of its price range 40  to  6 50  Price range is now  6  7 ENPH is one of nine new IPOs scheduled for the week of March 26  For a summary  SUMMARYENPH developed a semiconductor  inverter  based approach to converting direct current produced from solar energy devices to alternating current  used to distribute electricity to homes   most businesses ENPH is currently an industry leader but is not making money  and doesn t expect to make money in 2012 ENPH was founded in 2006 and to far has pretty much had its market to itself  However  competition is coming SMA Solar Technology AG  Power One  PWER  and SunPower  SPWR    leading inverter vendors serving the residential and small commercial inverter markets   are expected to introduce microinverter products in 2012  In addition  several new entrants to the microinverter market  including some of ENPH s OEM customers and partners  have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products Even though the market for solar power is projected to increase going forward  it ran into a bump in 2011  Because a most solar power funding is based on government sources  and because governments are running low on resources  future growth of the solar market is not as bright as it was several years ago It appears that ENPH had a market window of opportunity and may not have gotten through it time to profitability CONCLUSIONENPH is generating admirable top line quarterly revenue increases  gross profit is increasing but even so EHPN has not yet had a breakeven quarter Therefore  given the industry trends noted above  we would pass on the ENPH IPO BUSINESSENPH has pioneered a fundamentally new inverter technology for the solar industry that increases energy production  simplifies design and installation  improves system uptime and reliability  reduces fire safety risk and provides a platform for intelligent energy management To date  the solar industry has relied on the traditional central inverter approach to power conversion that has largely remained unchanged for the past two decades ENPH has built from the ground up a semiconductor based microinverter system that converts energy at the individual solar module level and  combined with proprietary networking and software technologies  provides advanced energy monitoring and control ENPH s unique approach is vastly different than the central inverter approach that can only convert energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit  and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array To date the solar industry has relied on the traditional central inverter approach that has largely remained unchanged for the past two decades MARKET GROWTHIn 2010  99  of the gigawatts   GW   volume of solar inverters deployed were traditional central inverters  The worldwide market for inverter technology in 2011 was almost 27 GW  or  6 8 billion  and the market is expected to grow to 46 GW  or  10 1 billion  by 2015  according to IMS Research MARKET ISSUESThe solar photo voltaic   PV   installation market grew strongly in 2011 and new installations reached an estimated 25 GW  up 39  from 18 GW in 2010 according to IHS iSuppli However  several European countries experienced a slowdown in new installations in 2011  as national governments revised solar tariffs and subsidies  This slowdown was offset by strong growth in other regions  including the United States Given current budget difficulties  several governments are expected to revise solar tariffs and reduce support for solar PV installations in 2012  In addition  oversupply for solar modules and increasing competition from low cost Chinese module manufacturers weigh on the sector  Some of these challenges are expected to continue in 2012  with global solar PV installations expected to decline 7  to 23 GW  according to IHS iSuppli Beyond 2012  growth is expected to remain robust with new solar installations expected to reach 48 GW by 2015  according to IHS iSuppli DC to AC INVERTER INDUSTRY direct current to alternating current Since the beginning of solar photo voltaic  PV  industry  traditional central inverters have continued to use high voltage analog technologies to convert DC to AC requiring complex design and string calculations to ensure safe and reliable system operation Historically  traditional central inverters have been the only inverter technology used for solar PV installations  In an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter  the solar PV modules are connected in series strings In a large installation  there are multiple series strings connected in parallel  The aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter  The central inverter performs two key functions   i  it establishes a maximum power point tracking  or MPPT  operating point for the system and  ii  converts power from high voltage DC to grid complaint AC PRODUCT BENEFITSENPH delivers microinverter technology for the solar industry that increases energy production  simplifies design and installation  improves system uptime and reliability  reduces fire safety risk and provides a platform for intelligent energy management  ENPH is the market leader in the microinverter category and has grown rapidly since its first commercial shipment in mid 2008  with over 1 550 000 microinverter units sold as of December 31  2011  representing over an estimated 40 000 system installations ENPH was the first company to commercially ship microinverter systems in volume  ENPH products have been installed in all 50 U S  states and eight Canadian provinces  and ENPH is rapidly taking market share from traditional central inverter manufacturers  HISTORYENPH was founded in March 2006 and began generating revenue in June 2008  From inception to December 31  2011  ENPH raised over  115 2 million in net proceeds from the private placements of convertible preferred stock and convertible debt Product development and sales and marketing milestones  From inception to the second quarter of fiscal 2008  ENPH s efforts focused on developing a complete microinverter solution for the solar PV industry   In the second quarter of 2008  ENPH began selling its first generation microinverter along with our Envoy communications gateway device and our Enlighten web based monitoring service   In the first half of 2009  ENPH focused on the development of second generation microinverter and migrated contract manufacturing to Flextronics  which provided ENPH access to commercial scale manufacturing and logistics services   In the third quarter of 2009  ENPH began selling a second generation microinverter in volume   In 2010  ENPH invested in the sales and marketing organization to increase market penetration  continued design innovations for second generation microinverter  sold more than 400 000 units and commenced development of third generation microinverter   In the second quarter of 2011  ENPH began selling a third generation microinverter   In the fourth quarter of 2011  ENPH began selling products in France  Italy and the Benelux region  and  During 2011  sold more than 1 000 000 microinverters DISTRIBUTIONENPH sells microinverter systems primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers  Over 3 400 installers in North America have installed ENPH microinverters through December 31  2011  and this number is increasing by 100 new installers per month  ENPH also sells directly to large installers and through OEMs and strategic partners A substantial majority of revenue has been generated by sales within the United States  Sales to customers in Canada commenced in 2009 and accounted for approximately 3   13  and 12  of net revenues in 2009  2010 and 2011  respectively ENPH anticipates that the majority of 2012 revenues will continue to come from the United States  with the balance from Canada and Europe EXPECTATIONSENPH expects to incur a net loss in 2012 and may continue to incur net losses in future years as it continues to invest substantial resources to support the growth of the business However  over time  ENPH believes the significant investments it is making to scale the business will allow ENPH to achieve an increasingly efficient operating cost structure ENPH believes that this  combined with the differentiated value proposition of its microinverter solution including product cost reductions through further semiconductor integration  will allow ENPH to improve gross profit and reduce operating expenses as a percentage of revenue MANUFACTURINGENPH outsources its manufacturing to third party manufacturers and negotiates product pricing on a quarterly basis  In addition  a contract manufacturer also serves as the logistics provider by warehousing and delivering products in the United States and Canada ENPH believes its contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the growing demand for ENPH products for the foreseeable future  However  shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect ENPH s ability to meet customer demand for our products WEB BASED MANAGEMENT REPLACESTradition big box Direct Current to Alternating Current converterENPH s microinverter solution brings a system based  high technology approach to solar energy generation leveraging ENPH s design expertise across power electronics  semiconductors  networking  and embedded and web based software technologies ENPH s microinverter system consists of the following hardware and service components  Enphase microinverter  Envoy communications gateway  and Enlighten web based software service  Since inception approximately 99  of ENPH s net revenues have been derived from the sale of hardware products INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYAs of March 1  2012  ENPH had 15 issued U S  patents  two issued non U S  patents  52 pending U S  patent applications and 111 pending non U S  counterpart patent applications EMPLOYEES313 as of March 1  2012 COMPETITIONCurrently  competitors in the inverter market range from large  international companies such as Solar Technology AG  Fronius International GmbH and Power One  Inc  to emerging companies offering alternative microinverter or other solar electronics products ENPH principally competes with large  incumbent solar inverter companies because traditional central inverter solutions can be used as alternatives to ENPH s microinverter solution ENPH believes  however  that its microinverter solutions offer significant advantages and competitive differentiation relative to traditional central inverter technology  even when traditional central inverter technology is supplemented by DC to DC optimizers SMA Solar Technology AG  Power One and SunPower   leading inverter vendors serving the residential and small commercial inverter markets  are expected to introduce microinverter products in 2012  In addition  several new entrants to the microinverter market  including some of ENPH s OEM customers and partners  have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products USE OF

26618,248133,AEIS,Raymond James  Molchanov Sees Stars In The Expanding Cleantech Sector,opinion,"Cleantech  an outperformer in the energy space since 2012  experienced a major expansion phase in 2013 that is still unfolding  In this interview with The Energy Report  Raymond James Energy Analyst Pavel Molchanov points to companies with innovative technologies  strong balance sheets and financial flexibility as examples of low risk with high flying rewards  Find out about his strongest Buy recommendation  as well as a special situation in big oil 
The Energy Report  Let s talk about growth in the energy sector  How well is the cleantech investment sector positioned during the next six to eight quarters 
Pavel Molchanov  The cleantech index has been the best performer of the energy indexes over the past two years  Since the beginning of 2012  cleantech has outperformed oil services  E P companies and MLPs  and has dramatically outperformed coal  2012 was a tough year for the cleantech space  But 2013 was fantastic  and year to date cleantech is outperforming again  despite the choppy market  I doubt that cleantech will continue to perform at this pace during the next two years  but there are many opportunities  In 2013 the cleantech index was up 58   but there were plenty of stocks that doubled and even tripled  There were also stocks that were cut in half  This is a stock picker s market 
TER  Do you categorize cleantech stocks as intrinsically high risk 
PM  There are a number of cleantech companies at the low end of the risk spectrum  so we have to look at them case by case  As a matter of investor perception  the cleantech space appears to have a fair amount of volatility  and in some cases it does have a very high beta  But generally speaking  cleantech stocks  like most tech stocks  will outperform in a bull market and underperform when the Dow is under pressure 
TER  What cleantech companies do you like right now 
PM  EnerNOC Inc  ENOC O  is currently my strongest Buy recommendation in cleantech  It is at the lower end of the risk spectrum  and it has done quite well for two years  It is still not priced for perfection  currently trading at about six times EBITDA  The company has no debt  and it has been throwing off free cash flow year after year 
TER  What is EnerNOC s business 
PM  EnerNOC is an energy software company that fits nicely into the cleantech category because it enables energy efficiency solutions using proprietary technology  In other words  it is not weatherizing windows  or building diesel generators  It uses advanced software to improve stability on the grid  EnerNOC connects utilities to commercial and industrial power users and enables demand side energy efficiency solutions  particularly when the grid is in crisis  Imagine a hot summer day when the grid is overburdened  Normally  there could be rolling blackouts  EnerNOC prevents blackouts with its automated demand response software  It is essentially a service company with regularly recurring revenue  and it earns extra revenue during times of crisis on the grid 
It has created a nicely diversified revenue mix  In 2010  it only operated in the U S  Last year  20  of its revenue came from Australia and New Zealand  And in the last 90 days  it has expanded into Japan  Germany  Austria and Ireland  Demand response is an effective strategy for countries such as Germany that generate a high amount of renewable power  Renewables can be intermittent on the grid  demand response reduces this intermittency by filling in the gaps 
TER  Is EnerNOC s software proprietary 
PM  Absolutely proprietary  A secret sauce  so to speak 
TER  Does it have competitors 
PM  EnerNOC has competitors in all its markets  but it is the largest demand response provider in the world  In the U S   it enjoys a 30  market share  There are other demand response companies out there  but they are either not public  or they are not pure plays  Johnson Controls Inc   for example  runs a demand response business  but it is a small part of a very big company 
TER  Does EnerNOC pay dividends 
PM  No dividends  though it throws off so much free cash that it could  The firm does have a very acquisitive track record  and most recently it has been implementing a share buyback program 
TER  Do you have a target price for EnerNOC 
PM  EnerNOC s share price has doubled in the past year  Right now it is at  21 share and we have a  26 share target price on it 
TER  What is new in solar power 
PM  2013 was a good year for the solar industry  It was a year of recovery after the tough years in 2011 and 2012  Two big swing factors in 2013 were China and Japan  China became the largest solar market in the world because the government dramatically ramped up domestic installation of solar  Japan became the second biggest market because it also prioritized solar adoption 
There are various dynamics informing these new pro solar policies by both of these nations  China wants to provide a backdoor bailout to its troubled solar manufacturers  but there is also an environmental element at work amid the epic pollution  Japan  on the other hand  is literally running out of power  After the Fukushima disaster and the shutdown of the country s nuclear industry  it needs every watt it can generate  and solar is a big part of that  In 2013  global solar installations totaled approximately 35 gigawatts  That may not be dramatic  but it was up 12  compared to 2012 levels 
TER  Do you have any picks in the solar power sector 
PM  We like a billion dollar company called Advanced Energy Industries Inc  NASDAQ AEIS   It makes inverters  the cash registers of solar energy systems  Inverters connect the generating system to the grid  Inverter manufacturing is a competitive market  there are a lot of players  including some new entrants  But it is experiencing a more benign form of competition compared to companies that make cells and modules  The gross margin structure for inverter companies is around 25  to 30   which is double the typical margin for module makers 
Advanced Energy is not 100  solar  though  It has a legacy semiconductor capital equipment business that makes up half of its revenue  The solar inverter business is the other half of revenue  but the solar part of the sales mix is growing much faster than the semi  We are looking for earnings of over  2 in 2014  The stock is in the mid twenties and trading at a relatively moderate multiple  The firm is debt free and throwing off a lot of free cash flow  Like EnerNOC  Advanced Energy is using some of that cash to make creative acquisitions 
TER  I take it you re not too bullish on module manufacturers 
PM  Generally  no  Although we look at each company individually  the module assembly part of the value chain in the solar space does not excite me  Low cost players can have slightly better than average margins  but it is a pure commodity market with very little technological differentiation  By contrast  a company like Advanced Energy has a lot of proprietary intellectual property 
TER  What about residential and business delivery of solar power 
PM  SolarCity Corporation  SCTY O  is the largest U S  provider of residential solar systems  It is very well known for the success of its solar leasing model  Solar leasing is done by lots of companies  but SolarCity is the biggest  And SolarCity was one of the very best performers in cleantech in 2013  The stock has done amazingly well since its IPO in late 2012  Although it is certainly not cheap  there are many positive elements to the company  including a predictable recurring revenue model tied to its 20 year lease contracts 
SunPower Corporation  NASDAQ SPWR  has a footprint in module manufacturing and also in the residential solar leasing arena  I suspect that during the next 12 months there will be a slew of solar leasing firm IPOs  Given the multiples at which SolarCity trades  its competitors must be salivating to go public 
TER  What about biofuels  Any picks there 
PM  Biofuels have morphed into a broader arena called bioindustrials  Biofuel companies are now trying to sell high value materials into specialty markets  Selling the higher value products provides more profit than competing directly with petroleum fuels  For example  KiOR Inc  KIOR O  is a cellulosic fuel company that was trying to compete with commodity fuels  Unfortunately  KiOR ran into operational difficulties last year  Given the current state of its operations and its rather strained balance sheet  I am not steering investors to the KIOR stock currently 
Solazyme Inc  SZYM O  is a more promising story at the moment  Solazyme is an industrial biotech company that uses algae technology to make high value products  It is currently selling cosmetics in the skincare market  That is a very different market from the biofuel arena  These types of products have higher value pricing and lower volumes  In the next few weeks  Solazyme will be opening the world s largest algae based oil production plant in Brazil  Eventually the company may get into biofuels  but that is not its present priority 
TER  What about the more traditional oil and gas arena 
PM  Raymond James  view on oil prices is that there will be downward pressure on oil over the next 12 to 18 months  We are concerned about the possibility of an emerging global oil oversupply  particularly in the U S   given the surge of domestic production  We are below consensus in our oil price forecast  In that context  the stocks that we generally prefer in oil and gas tend to be more defensive companies that have better capital discipline  pay dividends and buy back shares  In other words  we like companies that live within their means and have strong balance sheets and financial flexibility  These tend to be larger companies as a general rule 
TER  Like whom 
PM  I am a big fan of Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX   Its stock has been beaten down year to date  Not so much because of oil prices  but because the company is spending  11 billion   11B  this year out of a total  35B dollar capital budget on two LNG megaprojects in Australia  Gorgon LNG is set to start up in 2015  and Wheatstone LNG in 2016  Because of these two megaprojects  Chevron is targeting nearly 5  annualized production growth in 2015  2016 and 2017  which is by far the fastest in its peer group  And as production grows and capital spending flattens  the firm s free cash flow metrics should improve significantly which is why I really like this stock 
TER  Any others 
PM  InterOil Corporation  NYSE IOC  is a special situation in oil and gas that has my attention  The company resides in the higher end of the risk spectrum and it is definitely far from a dividend story  It has a  3B market cap  It is a preproduction E P company that discovered one of the biggest gas fields in the South Pacific more than five years ago  It is now developing the gas field through a partnership with Total S A   TOT   which is a major oil and gas company based in France 
Total and InterOil announced this partnership in December of last year and recently finalized all the terms  InterOil has received a  401 million cash payment for selling a portion of its gas to Total  InterOil will also have a stake in an LNG plant slated to be built as a part of the project 
TER  Do you have a target price on InterOil 
PM  InterOil s stock is trading in the sixties  and we have a  100 share target price  High risk  high reward 
TER  Thanks for your time today  Pavel 
PM  Thank you
