2345,223860,BSRR,Is A Surprise Coming For Sierra Bancorp  BSRR  This Earnings Season ,opinion,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Sierra Bancorp   NASDAQ BSRR   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Sierra Bancorp is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings   with the most up to date information possible   is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BSRR in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 43 cents per share for BSRR  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BSRR  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  2 38  heading into earnings season Sierra Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise    Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that BSRR has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Sierra Bancorp   and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2018-01-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-a-surprise-coming-for-sierra-bancorp-bsrr-this-earnings-season-200281760,200281760
2346,223861,BSRR,Stocks In Focus  Sierra  Tango  Foxtrot  And Uniform,opinion,"Several months ago  I wrote what turned out to be one of the most important posts of the year  ES  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot  which laid out four possible directions  out of infinite possibilities  for the stock market  Happily  my most bearish prediction   Delta   turned out to be the case  although things went much  much lower than I dared imagine  
I d like to go out on a limb again with a similar post  presenting four possible paths  Instead of Alpha  Bravo  Charlie  Delta  I hereby offer to you beloved readers the four possible paths of Sierra  Tango  Foxtrot  and Uniform 
The first  Sierra  is the most bullish  It calls for a piercing of the line at 2685 on the S P 500 cash index  soaring toward the December 3  trade truce  peak  It then takes a dive  finding support at the psychologically important 2600 line before bouncing strongly  challenging lifetime highs  This would  of course  be the death knell for the bears 
Next up is Tango  a somewhat modified version of Sierra  In this case  we also zip through the resistance line  matching the  Trade Truce  highs  and we likewise fall to 2600  We then start to rally     and here s where the difference is     that rally stalls  and we start falling  cutting through support at 2600 

Continuing to move toward more bearish scenarios  we see here now Foxtrot  which calls for an immediate bout of weakness when this week begins  We plunge toward Fibonacci Retracement at about 2450  find an opportunity to rally back to 2600  and then plunge from there  cutting below last year s lows 

Finally     and least plausibly     we have Superior Uniform Group Inc  NASDAQ SGC   which calls for basically a  wave 3  style tumble  in which we go into a December 2018 style fall with virtually no relief for our bullish friends  Again  as much as I d love to see this  I view it as the most unlikely 

The biggest uncertainty  I think  is what s going to happen with China  It seems pretty clear that Jerome Powell has absolutely no backbone at all  and is as sycophantic to the President as his predecessors  So I fully expect him to throw in the towel on any kind of  normalization   We re pretty deep into the earnings season  and it doesn t seem like there s any particularly strong bullish or bearish theme to those  It is all up to China at this point to dictate whether the bulls get to laugh all the way to the bank  just like the past ten years  or whether the bears finally get the upper paw ",2019-01-27,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/see-the-fine-ukulele-200379747,200379747
2347,223862,BSRR,Should Value Investors Pick Sierra Bancorp  BSRR  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Sierra Bancorp   NASDAQ BSRR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Sierra Bancorp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 39  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 58  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Sierra Bancorp s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE also compares pretty favorably with the Zacks   Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 07  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Sierra Bancorp has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 40  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for SAL stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Sierra Bancorp has a P S ratio of about 3 1  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Sierra Bancorp currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes the stock a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio comes in at 9 34  which is better than the industry average of 10 12  Clearly  the stock is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though BSRR might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C  This gives BSRR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen two upward revisions with one downward movement in the past sixty days  For the full year  the estimate has seen three upward revisions in the same time period with no movement in the opposite direction This has had an impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased 3 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate rose 2 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Sierra Bancorp Price and Consensus   This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineSierra Bancorp is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Also  a Zacks Rank of 2 instills our confidence However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 15  of more than 250 industries   it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks West Banks industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance  a good Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Sierra Bancorp
