14762,236277,PAAS,Top Mining Stock Picks For 2020,opinion,"PI Financial has two top mining stock picks for the coming year as well as some to watch
SmallCapPower   January 20  2020  PI Financial recently released its top mining stock picks for 2020  Its two best ideas in the space are K92 Mining and SilverCrest Metals 
 K92 Mining Inc    TSXV KNT   PI Financial analysts Chris Thompson and Justin Stevens noted that whilst 2019 was a transformative year for K92 Mining  shoring up the balance sheet  elimination of a contingent payment  NYSE GOLD   developing  improving mine plant infrastructure plus expanding on exploration success at Kora North  they see KNT as well positioned to further unlock value on multiple fronts during 2020 
First up   a revised resource update and PEA  1H 20  will provide a glimpse of Kainantu s expansion potential  complimented by near term production growth and exploration drilling to add flavour  The analysts anticipate a significant H1 20 resource upgrade  Noting KNT s near term goal of defining a 5Moz AuEq resource at Kainantu  excluding Irumafimpa   they continue to see their modelled operating plan  7 2Mt mined hosting  2M oz AuEq or  40  of KNT s 5Moz AuEq goal  as conservative  They anticipate a PEA  H1 20  laying the groundwork for Kainantu s expansion beyond 400ktpa  a catalyst which they believe merits a premium valuation 
The analysts see  US 57M in Free Cash Flow  FCF   presuming US 1 500 oz Au  generated in 2020  implying a  11  FCF EV yield  They see KNT trading at a 0 80x NAV multiple vs  junior precious metal producer peers trading in a wide range but averaging a 0 75x NAV multiple and  thus  have increased their target price to C 4 50  C 4 00 previously   implying a 1 14x Adj  P NAV multiple 
K92 Mining is focused on exploration and development of mineral deposits located in Papua New Guinea  The Company s main asset is the Kainantu Gold Project  consisting of two gold deposits  The Kainantu property covers a total area of approximately 410 square kilometers and is located in the Eastern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea  180 km west northwest of Lae 
 SilverCrest Metals Inc    TSX SIL  PI Financial analyst Philip Ker noted that given the on going underground development  infill and exploration drilling across Las Chispas  SilverCrest is expected to continue its advancement with a Feasibility Study  FS  and a construction decision in H1 20  Given the anticipated favourable economics expected within the FS  PEA   After tax IRR of 78  and NPV of US407M   he believes SilverCrest has options to secure remaining capital needs 
Philip Ker added that given the compounding success of Las Chispas and SilverCrest s valuation  many continue to shy away from the potential yet to be unlocked at the project  However  SilverCrest continues to make high grade discoveries and is improving up front economics via resource growth and positive grade reconciliation  In 2020  he expect SilverCrest to have an abundance of news flow including a steady stream of drill results related to on going infill drilling at Babicanora along with results from the new discovery made at Area 118  The analyst has a  10 50 target price on the stock based on a 1 2x NAVPS multiple and a  1 500 oz gold price as well as a  18 00 oz silver price 
SilverCrest is a Canadian precious metals exploration company headquartered in Vancouver  BC  which is focused on new discoveries  value added acquisitions and targeting production in Mexico s historic precious metals districts  The Company s current focus is on the high grade  historic Las Chispas mining district in Sonora  Mexico  SilverCrest is the first company to successfully drill test the historic Las Chispas Property resulting in numerous discoveries 
Here are some other resource stocks PI Financial thinks are worth watching 
 Pan American Silver Corp    NASDAQ PAAS    They see the exploration success  La Colorada  reflecting PAAS  ability to add value organically  This plus latent value  Escobal   Navidad  and a diversified production base  qualifying PAAS as an Ag Au base metal producer to watch during 2020 
OceanaGold Corporation  TSX OGC    Whilst 2019 was a tough on OGC   Didipio s suspension   investor surprise over Waihi s operational hiatus   PI recognizes exploration development upside across the board  qualifying OGC as an attractively valued intermediate gold producer to watch in 2020 
 Nighthawk Gold Corp    TSX NHK    Aggressive drilling of its Colomac project over the past two years is expected to improve the geologic model and resource for the Colomac and Damoti Lake ore bodies while positive results support increased in situ ounces and a grade boost 
 Bonterra Resources Inc    TSXV BTR    Has a war chest of capital to advance its trio of high grade projects in Quebec via drilling and potential underground bulk sampling while utilizing its scalable and permitted 800tpd milling facility ",2020-01-21,"Sean Mason, SmallCapPower.com",https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-mining-stock-picks-for-2020-200500161,200500161

Speaking of  up   notably have an above glance at Silver s rightmost bar  that low to high  2 3  run on Friday was a loaded leverage payday for the likes of miners such as Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS  which from its intra day low of 22 12 went on a  5 3  run up to 23 30  a tip of the cap for that to a valued reader and their  sell into strength  trading wisdom   Double your pleasure with doublesprint stocks   Or if you prefer hitting triples  Silver itself for the week  low to high  gained  3 2   said stock  11 4    Further still from the esoteric futures pit  the week s low to high gain on Silver s  initial margin requirement  was  46 7       What s in yer algorithm   Not  
Through it all from the  Gold Plays No Currency Favourites Dept   have you been tracking the Dollar  From its Index settle three weeks ago  03 January   the brash buck is  1 1   Gold s net change for the like period   1 0   Both are up 







Or from just a week ago  the Dollar is  0 3  and Gold  as noted  is  0 9   Again  both are up  But  oh no  the stock market as measured by the S P 500 just recorded its second weakest down week since that ending 22 November  Dollar up  Gold up  S P 500 down  Poor bedside manner perhaps  but is there a  virus  in the air  Sadly so  the Corona  don t you know  Yet once under control watch for market reversals to unfold 
Nowhere near reversing  any near term weakness notwithstanding  is Gold s parabolic Long trend per the weekly bars  As we next see here  the upside path is now five weeks in duration and there s nearly 100 points of downside room with which to work before flipping the stance to Short  Yet as well as Silver seems to be doing  her ratio with Gold nonetheless remains near all time highs at 86 7x 







On to the Economic Barometer  Swiss Style   With the past week being largely focused on the hoity toity heights of Davos bringing us the usual bloviating from the well intended aristocratic experts toward economically saving the planet  we noted that the Econ Baro graphic in this year over year view has taken on  rather accurately  the very geographic appearance of our beloved Switzerland itself  And from Basel s banking gnomes to Davos  economic elite  what is ultimately in the balance for us common sense individuals  eh  May Gold shield us from whatever snow jobs blow our way  Here s the graphic 







Specific to the S P 500 with Q4 Earnings Season picking up its pace of incoming reports  68 of the mighty Index s constituent results thus far find 71  of them  beating estimates      but only 63  actually improving their bottom lines  And the average year over year EPS change   8 5   That ain t gonna do much to alleviate our stratospherically high  live  price earnings ratio of 40 4x  And as for yesterday s  0 9  market drop    the S P s worst since 08 October   1 6      the moneyflow associated with the selling was sufficiently thin that once the  virus  wanes from the headlines  stack we  ought  see stocks back on an upside track    unless this time their top truly is in place     a Gold saving grace 
Gliding up through their respective 10 day Market Profiles have been the precious metals  prices  Here they are for Gold  below left  and Silver  below right  with their most intensively traded levels as labeled 







So there we have it  and there s a lot of it   Tis the near term technical suggestion for lower Gold  per our declining  Baby Blues   countered by a Coronavirus instead kicking down stocks  already horribly over valued in their own right    Tis Q4 Earnings Season  one nowhere supportive of present price levels    Tis January  and all the new year s positioning that comes with it    Tis another nudge forward of the Doomsday Clock  to it all going backward    Tis Impeachment  the latest soap opera sleep aid   And      wait for it       Tis the Fed  That s right  perhaps lost in the midst of all these  Tis  comes this next Tuesday Wednesday gathering of the Federal Open Market Committee  whereby in sticking to that which they ve already said  they ll merely sit  round toward doing nothing  Kinda Davos esque  non  Just don t say no to Gold nor Silver as any near term pullback  by wisdom  ought yield higher comeback ",2020-01-26,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-gold-update-wisdom-wins-with-gold-and-silver-200501614,200501614

157874,379390,PAAS,Gold Update  Tis A Gold Trifecta,opinion,"What a wonderful week for Gold  In settling Friday at 1516   twas Gold s best week by both percentage   2 2   and points   33  since than ending Aug  9  And it brought with it a terrific trifecta  Here we go 
First Place  
Santa comes through  Our Nov  30 query  Shall Santa Gift Gold at 1500   was answered in the affirmative and moreover with exquisite timing  ole St  Nick delivering the goods with just three trading hours to spare before the Christmas break  the price of 1500 being regained at precisely 07 11 Pacific Time  15 11 GMT  leading into the  night of nights   after having fallen from that level back on 05 November and only to then to have been saved by the sublime  support shelf  at 1454 1434  Further  since the last tapping that shelf on Thanksgiving Eve  Nov  27   Gold is now  4 3   Silver is  5 6   and amongst the top quality precious metals equities  Newmont Goldcorp Corp  NYSE NEM  is  11 9  and  Pan American Silver Corp   NASDAQ PAAS  is  23 8   Got leverage  The king is in his counting house 
Second Place  
 Tis a Gold Update Scoreboard Milestone  See it up there a flashin  in green  Our valuation of Gold given currency debasement per the StateSide money supply measure of M2  even as offset for the increase in the supply of Gold itself  has crossed above the  3 000 oz level  So much upside distance by which to regress toward getting back in sync with the  faux dough   And as is our wont to say  that s before the overshoot 
Third Place  
Gold has sufficiently muscled up such that we re ready to reveal our forecast high for next year  1675  Discounting the two remaining trading days for this year    and they could be doozies regardless of direction    1675 from here yields a gain during 2020 of 10   On the heels of this year s overall run to as much as  22   that may seem conservative to some  but  tis that very 1650 1700 zone which was rife with fits n  starts n  support n  resistance in each of 2011  2012 and 2013 
To wit as we turn to our chart of Gold by the 100s  this time animated so as to see  The Gap  getting filled in a bit   the 1600s represent the top of that span   Course  bust up into the 1700s and the Great Drive to 2000 will be on  But initially  let s look to 1675 as a realistic  indeed admirable  goal for 2020 







But wait  there s more  Guess what technical Gold staple just flipped from Short to Long 
 Gold s weekly parabolics  mmb    
Our man Squire right there nailing the answer to the rhetorical question  But  tis a beautiful thing as well  this next chart of Gold s weekly bars  In brilliant ebb and flow rhythm from one year ago to date we ve seen price s retaking of Base Camp 1377 en route to meeting our conservative forecast high of 1434  in turn becoming the base of the rectangular  support shelf   followed by the turbo charged boost to the aggressive forecast high at 1526  and  although briefly  then some   Here s the graphic  the first new encircled blue dot of the Long trend pointing the way higher   Miss Gibbs  Could you please reach out to the Louvre as to their taking this one on loan  







Impressive  or better stated excessive    and extremely so by every technical tool ever devised    is the stock market as measured by the S P 500  Not to esoterically drag you through the weeds  but for each of the past five trading days we ve recorded  extreme  overbought S P readings by Bollinger Bands  Relative Strength  and Stochastics  The last day we had five such successive extreme readings on all three studies was 11 April  after which the S P then fell from 2918 to 2729   6 5   come 03 June  Just sayin   party boy  as we next bring in the Economic Barometer  blue line  and S P 500  red line  year over year 







 Twas a quiet week for incoming data as evidenced by the Baro s rightmost flatlining  no news in turn being good news for the S P  That noted  the  agreed to Phase 1  United States China trade deal has yet to actually be inked  whilst elsewhere  according to a FinTimes poll of 34 economists  EuroZone economic growth for next year is forecast to average less than  1    the Stateside averaged annualized Gross Domestic Product growth rate through this year s three quarters is  2 4   
Now as for you skeptics out there whose inarguable belief is that Gold and the stock market trade in opposite directions  let s take a quick peek at the yellow metal s performance vs  that of the S P from one month ago to date  21 trading days   Well looky there     Gold is  3 6  and the S P  2 7  as they renew their pas de deux 







 Course year to date  those gains are at present  18 2  and  29 2  respectively  And unless you re Mr  Bond  this last month has been  nuthin  but up  as we go  round the horn for all eight components that make up the BEGOS Markets  Here are their daily bars and  Baby Blues   the dots that indicate the consistency of each market s 21 day linear regression trend  And at the Bond s demise  the balance of the bunch have been on the rise

157925,379441,PAAS,Selecting Silver Miners For October 2019,opinion,"Gold and silver are our main focus  no doubt about it  But they are only a part of the precious metals market  Actually  there is another side of the market that could be overlooked by investors starting to look into the precious metals market  So  we would like to take some time to explain how this part is important and why you may be interested in it at all 
Spoiler alert  we are talking about   These are the stocks of companies whose main activity is digging gold and silver up from the ground and selling it  It does not take a whole lot of imagination to realize that the profits of these companies are highly dependent on the price of precious metals  After all  if gold and silver become more expensive  then the profits of the mining companies are likely to go up  And so is the share price of such companies  Consequently  if gold and silver go up in value  then mining stocks are likely to go up as well  It s as simple as that  And the opposite is also true  if precious metals depreciate  then mining stocks are likely to go lower  Mining stocks  or miners  as they are called  are directly related to the price of gold and silver  and this is why they are an important avenue of the market 
OK  so we got that covered  But why exactly would you like to know about that at all  Probably  because you would not want your potential profits to be limited by the magnitude of the move in gold or silver  Your read that right  It is possible to gain more on a move in gold or silver than the move itself  This seems like enough to be interested in this sector  so we will leave out some of the less important reasons 
Now a short explanation why this is the case  For accounting reasons  when gold or silver move  the move can be magnified by the move in the share price of a given mining company  this could be called    Whether it is actually magnified or not is highly dependent on what specific mining stock you are talking about  Some stocks do not even magnify the move but rather limit it  So  it is very important to focus on the ones that boost profits rather than the ones that limit them 
And how would you go about checking which stocks give you leverage relative to precious metals  You could try to calculate some metrics  but which ones really  Fortunately  we have already done this for you and we are keeping these metrics up to date  usually on a daily basis  The tools which give you the necessary information focus on pretty self explanatory parts of the precious metals market   and  
Getting the Hang of Silver Stocks
We will go through the motions of using our stock tools using the example of one of the most exciting markets now in the precious metals space   the silver market  So  we focus on the silver stocks tool 
There are at least four direct hints you get from the tool  The first one is that it puts a number on how well a given silver miner tracks the price of silver  This number is called  Exposure   it varies from 0  to 100   and it shows how well the moves in silver miners are aligned with the moves in silver  If a given miner moves in line with the white metal most of the time  Exposure will be high  A very high Exposure would suggest that a miner goes up and down almost exactly when silver goes up and down  Naturally  being in the silver market  you would usually want to focus on stocks with high Exposure 
But Exposure is not the whole story  We are interested in how much leverage a miner shows  Here s where the  Leverage  measure comes in   the second piece of information you get from the tool  It shows you how much bang for a buck a given miner offers  For example  if a silver miner has Leverage at 2  this means that if we see a move up in silver of 1   the miner could potentially move up 2   If silver moves up 10   the stock could move up 20  and so on  We use  potentially  and  could  here  because this is based on historical relationships and there are no sure bets in any market  Of course  there is a flip side  If a stock has high Leverage and silver goes down  the stocks could magnify the move down  This sword cuts both ways 
Third  you could use Leverage to rank the stocks and this is precisely what we do  The ranking of silver stocks is the third piece of information our  presents 
Finally   Valuation  gives you and idea whether a stock is under  or overvalued relative to historical values  Negative numbers indicate undervalued states while positive readings suggest overvalued states 

Enough on theoretical explanations  let s dig into what the ranking shows now and how that ties in to what s going on in the silver market  The first thing we get is the list of stocks  In this analysis  we limit it to the top 3  We use the  time horizon and medium level of risk tolerance  parameters for the tool   The calculations are based on data available on October 15  2019  You can go and check out the rest on the companies on the  page 





The stocks highlighted are   1   Endeavour Silver Corp    NYSE EXK      2   First Majestic Silver  Corp  NYSE AG  and  3   Pan American Silver Corp   NASDAQ PAAS  
Right off the bat  the Endeavour Silver Corporation the highest Leverage at 2 70  This means that this stocks is the one which offers the biggest bang for the buck  at least historically  with the potential of going up 2 70  if silver goes up 1   Conversely  it could go down  2 70  if silver goes down 1   It is also the most undervalued stock with Valuation at  12 77   Exposure stands at 64 96   lower than the other two companies  which means that the stock tracks silver quite well  but not as good as the other two analyzed stocks 
The First Majestic Silver Corporation is  better  in terms of Exposure  80 16   but offers less leverage  The Pan American Silver Corporation is similar to First Majestic in terms of Leverage but does a slightly worse job of tracking silver  What these indications boil down to is   If you re more concerned about getting the most of the move  you could go with Endeavour  If you re more interested in tracking silver closely  First Majestic might be the better option   Let s assume that it is the magnitude of the move that you would like to maximize  We focus on Endeavour 
The Cream of the Crop
If you take a minute to ponder the characteristics of the Endeavour Silver Corporation  a specific picture emerges  Namely  it looks like a good stock to own  potentially  if silver were to go up some more  It tracks silver relatively well  it has the most leverage and it offers the most potential for a move up 





The above chart shows the price of silver  horizontal axis  along with the price of the  Endeavour Silver Corp    NYSE EXK   vertical axis  for a given day  The red line shows that there  in fact  is a historical trend between the price of the yellow metal and the stock  In other words  Endeavour and silver did move together in the past  As the points are relatively close to the line  this confirms the relatively high Exposure  The high slope of the line confirms the high Leverage   moves in silver resulted in stronger moves in Endeavour in the past  The red dot allows you to compare the current relationship between silver and Endeavour to its historical trend  In other words  it shows the current price of silver  horizontal axis  against the current price of Endeavour  vertical axis   and the long term relationship between the two  red trend line   The dot falls firmly below the trend line which suggests and undervalued state 
Grounded in Reality
It s great to have such a depth of information on top silver stocks  but what we need to do is relate this to the current market environment  Let s take a look at the real price of silver  daily chart courtesy of   




The picture we see is one of silver after at least two important moves down and after two lower highs  This paints a rather bearish picture  We highlight all the reasons for the bearish picture in the precious metals market in our  alerts  What can we do with the indications of silver stocks given the fact that silver could potentially go lower instead of higher 
One idea could be to go short the Endeavour Silver Corporation instead of a classic long position  Exposure and Leverage would still be relevant  Simply put  such a position would magnify the profits in case silver goes lower  Going short can be tricky though and  perhaps  you are more interested in the long term implications  Then  you could wait for a potential rebound in silver or even for an important bottom  This would be precisely the time when all the favorable characteristics of the Endeavour Silver Corporation could pay off 
Mind that the implications of the analysis of silver stocks can change over time and it is necessary to keep up to date with the tool  It s easy  though   with a few clicks you can get the full picture at any time 
As you see  there is more than one way to use our silver stocks analysis  We have more ideas in store  but this is a discussion for another time 
This concludes our first analysis of top silver stocks  We hope this helps you navigate the market and gain the necessary tools to become successful in this space ",2019-10-17,Mike McAra,https://www.investing.com/analysis/selecting-silver-miners-for-october-2019-200474337,200474337

157955,379471,PAAS,Fool s Silver  Why Most  Silver Miners  Don t Live Up To Their Name,opinion,"By Stefan Gleason  

If you buy shares in a silver mining company  you will have to assume additional market risks compared to ownership of silver bullion  You may wish to do so in order to potentially gain leveraged exposure to silver prices 

What you may not realize  however  is that most of the publicly traded  silver  stocks out there are primarily in the business of mining other metals   sometimes gold  often copper  zinc  lead and other base metals 

Consider Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS   a  3 6 billion company that makes up the largest weighting  13 5   in the Global X Silver Miners ETF  NYSE SIL  

While Pan American is indeed a producer of silver  its business comes mainly from other metals  According to BMO estimates  only 33  of Pan American Silver s revenue in 2019 will come from silver production 

Rare is the silver miner that actually derives most of its revenue from silver mining  There are both geological and philosophical reasons behind the paucity of pure silver producers 

Since silver deposits tend to accumulate around other metals  valuable byproducts will be extracted during the mining process  Most silver is produced as a byproduct of mining for base metals  so primary silver mines are few and far between 

Mining company CEOs generally prefer to diversify their revenue streams beyond a single metal to manage risk and become more appealing to Wall Street analysts  bankers and institutional investors 

Gold and silver bugs who expect mining industry executives to share their bullishness about prices or their commitment to sound money principles will be sorely disappointed  Very few of them are allies to the broader precious metals community 

These companies also tend to be run by geologists  engineers and accountants who  by their nature  often don t see the big picture 

A recent and obnoxious example of this problem is Hecla Mining  NYSE HL   the Idaho based company that repeatedly refused to support legislative efforts in its home state that nearly ended income taxation on gold and silver 

Add Hecla management s refusal to reinforce the public policy importance of its own products  to the very state in which it operates  to the reasons this miner s stock price has gone nowhere but down in recent years  including during silver s recent rally 

One exception is First Majestic CEO Keith Neumeyer  He is enthusiastic about silver and tuned in to the values and concerns of physical bullion holders   First Majestic Silver   NYSE AG  is the purest major producer  with 62  of its revenue attributable to its namesake metal 

Of course  you will never find a purer silver play than actual  999 pure silver bullion products 

The further your silver related investments get from the underlying metal  the more they will be driven by other factors you may not necessarily understand or believe in 

When silver starts becoming a hot commodity again  Wall Street will surely supply a bevy of new  silver  equities and exchange traded derivative products   most of which will serve to divert casual investors away from investing in silver itself 

Right now one of the easiest   and least efficient   ways for the public to invest in the silver industry is through Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL  

This  Silver Miners  ETF is top heavy with majors that mine mostly other metals  It is also populated with royalty streaming exploration companies that do little to no mining  SIL carries an annual expense ratio of 0 65   which is quite high compared to other passively managed funds 

If your aim is to invest in silver producers  you re better off focusing on particular companies that deliver the goods  If you lack the time or know how to pick quality mining stocks  you won t go wrong by simply owning what they produce via physical bullion

results across all sectors are up 24  from the year ago period while revenues increased 9   Of the companies that have reported  78  of the companies delivered an earnings beat  while 76  surpassed revenues estimates  Considering all the companies that are yet to report  the S P 500 is anticipated to register 23  growth in the quarter  outperforming 13  improvement witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2017  On the revenue front  these companies will put up 8 7  growth on the scoreboard  ahead of the 8 1  rise noted in the fourth quarter 2017  In fact  this quarter is gearing up to be the

while revenues are projected to increase 22 3   The mining industry has regained ground with the improvement in commodity prices  renewing investors  interest  Metals such as iron  aluminum and copper are essential to regular technology and infrastructure  President Trump s promise to go on an infrastructure binge naturally provided a boost to the price of industrial metals last year  Growth in U S  GDP and continued improvement in end use sectors like automotive  aerospace and construction acted as tailwinds for metals  Consequently  mining companies  earnings improved significantly  leverage ratios have come down and improvement was witnessed in their capital allocation plans  The Chinese economy is anticipated to stimulate growth with further construction and infrastructure building projects  Prices have also gained on the back of China s drive to clean up its environment  Though Trump s recent imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is a welcome relief to domestic players  the fear of a global trade war is creating a cloud of uncertainty  This worked in favor of the safe haven metal   gold  The Fed s rate hikes also aided gold prices which declined prior to its implementation in March but experienced gains thereafter  Silver prices also gained in the quarter supported by a weaker U S  dollar and inflation  Let s have a sneak peek into three mining companies

2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can see  Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  You can

157995,379511,PAAS,Pan American Drops On Acquisition  More Risk Before Cyclical Bounce,opinion,"Summary 

Pan American Silver Corporation  NASDAQ PAAS  traded 11  lower on Wednesday morning 
The mining company announced that it would acquire Tahoe Resources  NYSE TAHO   which shot 45  higher on the news 
While there may be additional near term risk  we believe PAAS is setting up for a bounce 


Pan American agreed to purchase Tahoe for 1 07 billion in a cash and share deal  which will make the combined entity into one of the largest silver miners in the world  The combined entity will benefit from a new cost structure and will have twice the silver reserves 
 This establish the world s premier silver mining company with an industry leading portfolio of assets  superior growth opportunities  and attractive operating margins   explained Pan American CEO Michael Steinmann 
In analyzing the market cycles for PAAS  we can see it is in a declining phase with a near term bottom due in the coming weeks  As such  the was a good spot for a capitulation  Looking forward  our projection is for the stock to test  12  which will likely be a good spot to form a bottom

Indeed year to date  comparably lifeless is our Gold  From 2001 onward  the average trading range for the price of Gold through the first four calendar months of each year is 16 4   low price to high price   Last year was the narrowest for this period  just 5 0   Second narrowest  This year   twas just 6 5   Gold has been shelved  today sitting precisely atop The Box  1280 1240  whilst for the balance of the herd  tis nothing but stocks 
There are exceptions  however  A fine friend ensconced at the foot of the French Alps in the department of Is re wrote to us yesterday  stating     As you see I try to avoid the US market  I think it is overvalued today     Our reply       Overvalued   your understatement is hilarious      
To wit  permanently parked in our garage of market facts is the historical one that the S P 500 always regresses  either up or down  to a reasonable price earnings ratio  typically in the teens   our live  reading at this writing being 31 2x   That means earnings need double to support the current Index level of 2945  Are they  Hardly  With 362 of the S P s components having reported their Q1 earnings  62  are better than the same period a year ago  BUT  is the average increase the necessary  100  to get the p e in line  No  Specific to Q1   tis less than  1   Have a nice day 
Still  so far in 2019 whilst Gold sits in the dance hall corner commiserating with other contra Dollar components  the life of the party remains Oil  35 0   followed by the S P  17 5   Here s the full slate of the BEGOS Markets year to date  though 03 May   which sadly for Sister Silver ain t at all great 

As to Gold itself  turning to the weekly bars we find the red dots of parabolic Short trend now 10 weeks in duration  But the downside tilt continues to be comparatively shallow given the purple bounded  supportive protection of The Box 

Further  it being month s end plus three May days  let s pull up  or perhaps better stated pull down  our year over year percentage tracks for Gold and several of the highly visible precious metals equities  From least worst to the worst we find Gold itself  2  vis   vis this date a year ago  Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   3   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund GDX  NYSE GDX   10   the Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   22   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   24   and Pan American Silver Corp  NASDAQ PAAS   28   Poor ole PAAS  But from our  Fun With Figures Dept      and to be sure the Gold Silver ratio remains a historically high 85 6x    since PAAS  shares went public in 1995  the average Gold PAAS ratio is 62x  PAAS today is 12 bucks share  were Gold to reach our conservative forecast high for this year of 1434 and  this is a stretch  those ratios regress to average  we d find PAAS having nearly doubled to 23  Oh the vacuum of the perfect world  eh  Here are the tracks 

Query  for the precious metals to right themselves  must we have a stock market demise  Not really  The inevitable catch up to currency debasement shall be the ultimate Golden prize  notably padded by the overshoot such as we saw in 2011  during which intra year the S P did suffer a 16  setback before then zooming off nearly correction less into 2015  In fact  this past autumn saw a full 20  S P correction  somewhat short  pun intended  of our call for a 27  drop to 2154  which remains on the table  
But is it a myth that Gold and the S P are inversely correlated  It depends as to how one views it  Better than 13 years ago on 07 March 2006 Gold settled at 554 5 and the S P at 1275 88  Today Gold at 1280 2 is 130 9  higher     as identically is the S P at 2945 64     so with all due respect  Bob Frost  even having taken the road less traveled by hasn t made any difference   S P dividends aside   natch  

Where we are seeing a difference is finally some leveling off by the Economic Barometer  aided as noted in the prior week by Q1 Gross Domestic Product annualized growth of 3 2   which we expect to be revised lower given the broader downward tilt of the Baro  and April s firm creation of 263 000 Non Farm Payrolls  the fourth best reading in the 24 month Trump stint   the monthly average being 194 000    Things are good   and with the Fed s favoured inflation reading being flat for Core Personal Consumption Expenditures in March  Goldilocks  too  is prancing about at the party  But hidden growth forbearers are there as well  April found notable drops in both the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index and Institute for Supply Management surveys  whilst March Construction Spending fell 0 9   Here s the whole picture 

As for near term trend in the precious metals  a week ago  twas looking toward becoming our upside friend  The baby blue dots of linear regression trend consistency across the last three months of daily bars for Gold on the left and Silver on the right were turning higher  but this past week they resumed falling  Yet fortunately Friday brought buying force to the fore  especially for Sister Silver  her low to high range  14 600 to 14 995  or  0 395 points  was her best intra day rise since 01 March 

Friday s surge served as well to put prices respectively back up to mid Profile as we next see for Gold  below left  and Silver  below right  within the past 10 days 

But in the broadest picture for Gold from its All Time High far too long ago  early May shows price into the fourth month of a stumble  much to the jeering of the zero I Q  dude down there 

Next week is back loaded with inflation data  the PPI due Thursday and the CPI come Friday  Shall it be sufficiently benign to support the President s call for rate hike rescissions  The  estimates  say  no   But as we don t really know  likely best that you load up with Gold ",2019-05-05,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-sits-on-its-box-whilst-the-herd-chase-stocks-200417029,200417029

158000,379516,PAAS,Gold Update  Trend Flipped From Short To Long ,opinion,"To wit this bit from last week s missive 

     Gold s  trend could well flip to Long within just a week s time simply through normal trading oscillation  the distance from present price  1284  to parabolic  1306  is 22 points  Gold s  expected weekly trading range  is at present 23 points    

And  with a little drum roll please  that s what happened  Gold s weekly parabolic trend has just flipped from Short to Long  price settling out Friday at 1310  albeit aided  and if you like  abetted  by five added  Dance the Contango  points as trading volume moved from the June contract into that for August  Too much information perhaps  but  tis what  tis  Gold s net gain for this past week of  2 0  was its best since that ending 07 December  Straightaway  here s the picture and then we ll assess some reasonable upside expectation awaitin  in the wings 

Such begins Gold s 17th weekly parabolic Long trend since price printed its All Time High at 1923 on 06 September 2011  The burning question is thus  how much upside have these Long trends actually produced  Answer  the average maximum upside  which rarely is accurate as an imminent case s reality  for those prior 16 Long trends is  7 5   Were that to precisely pan out on this new run  we d see price ascend to 1408  which would be great as  twould near our  conservative  forecast high for this year of 1434   Course  the real challenge in getting that far is in first retaking Base Camp 1377  which from here at 1310 necessitates a rise of  5 1   Doable  Of course  but  tis hardly baked in the cake  in those prior 16 Long trends  only 10 achieved increases of at least that much  Moreover  from 1310 up into the 1360s there is a plethora of congestion and peaks such that ascent attempts across the past two years have not found price able push up through the 1360s  let alone reach just the 1350s on a run earlier this year 
All that technical mumbo jumbo aside  we did point out time and again throughout the most recent Short trend that price s descent was shallow at best  the decline therein at its worst being just  5 1   prior to which the previous Long trend s ascent was as much as  12 3   Add in that price s year over year trend is up  and again the Gold Bulls have a chance to stampede toward Base Camp 1377   the intermittent congestion notwithstanding   But if they were to take out the 1360s on this run  then watch for the mo mo crowd to start gettin  excited 
It now being month s end  let s look too at Gold vis   vis these key precious metals equities also as tracked from a year ago to date  from best to worst we ve Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   9   Gold itself  1   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  GDX  NYSE GDX    3   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   15   the Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   24   and Pan American Silver Corp  NASDAQ PAAS   39   And specific to Sister Silver  Gold s ratio to her now stands at a millennium to date record of 90 0x   Holy Toledo   Here are their percentage tracks 

 Course  Gold s having marched up  2 0  this past week is net net all that  tis actually gained year to date as we next display our BEGOS Market Standings  And the real story therein is Oil  four weeks ago  twas  35 0  for 2019  since which half of such run has been hoovered away  In fact for you website watchers out there  if back on 26 April when you saw on the Markets Trends page Oil s  Baby Blues   our measure of trend consistency  drop below the safety of their  80  level such that you went Short just one li l old contract  your gain to this point is  62 80   53 36  x  1 000 cac    9 440     lunch  therefore  being on you 

As well four weeks ago  the S P 500 was up an unsustainable  17 5  year to date  Essentially half that gain too is gone  By the media  blame it solely on the Prez  n Tariffs   not on the exasperatingly high  live  price earnings ratio of 29 8x   History has proven time and again that the stock market can remain unbearably overvalued for only so long  even in the face of the Economic Barometer having found some stability  For example  the Conference Board s May reading on Consumer Confidence hit a year to date high as did April s Personal Income  And the first revision to Q1 Gross Domestic Product was but a wee cut from an annual pace of  3 2  to  3 1   for which we were instead expecting something in the 2s   although we ve still the final revision near June s end   Indeed  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  sees the Q2 pace being down in the 1s  And as we see in the Econ Baro  the red line S P is finally caving in as it ought toward the blue line  Baro   Further  is this finally the full run to our S P target of 2154  On verra 

What we at present see is Gold s two day leap of 33 points   5  Contango  points   38 points in the lower left panel of the daily bars from three months ago to date  note thereto the prior peaks at 1315 and 1325 which ought find Gold s  range bounders  selling into this most recent spate of strength  As for the 10 day Market Profile in the lower right panel  the two dominant supporters at 1288 and 1281 underscore Gold s persistently having being sitting atop The Box  1280 1240  prior to this most recent gelandesprung 

Sadly for Sister Silver  her practically zero contango which took effect a month ago was obviously a no show as we turn to her like panels  Sis  gain for the week   0 1  vs  Gold s  2 0   Nada  She takes the Snoozer Award 

Awarded as well is Gold s overall performance for the month of May  albeit just  1 9    twas Gold s first up month following three successive downers  One takes what one can get  And as one looks eastward from Base Camp 1377 across the alp like peaks   tis clear they are the upside challenge above which Gold must make its ascent  else right back down again shall price be sent 

So there  tis  our key price trend for Gold having flipped from Short to Long  But for how  long   Given the aforeshown alpine congestion  the technical upside trek shan t be easy     unless of course  This Is It   And in the midst of it all comes one of the busiest weeks of the year per incoming data for the Econ Baro  17 reports are due next week  including May s payrolls  not to mention the Fed s Tan Tome appearing mid week  Be you minding your Gold or mining for more  c est superbe d avoir beaucoup d or ",2019-06-03,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-gold-update-200427599,200427599

158030,379546,PAAS,Time To Get Serious About Silver,opinion,"In this post I m going to take a serious look at silver  I believe the chartology is beginning to speak to us  signaling a huge opportunity that is setting up right now for those who can be a little patient  But first let s take a quick look at the current market 

That s a screen shot I took off of the lead headline on Drudge yesterday  so the public now knows the cat s out of the bag  That s right  you heard it here first as weeks ago this theme was outlined and made clear that it was coming our way in a hurry  The PM markets responded accordingly 
In my weekend report  I pointed out that we should all keep our eye on the VIX  If the VIX remained elevated  expect more trouble for the stock market  but if it dropped below 20 then we could expect the market to have a decent rally or even recover the losses of the past 10 days 
Yesterday we got the move below 20 and the market is starting to look a bit better as the chart below shows 

Note the mini break above the consolidation on the Dow chart  below 

I have made my opinion clear that in general the stock market could regroup and recover  but I am not interested in playing it  I see too much opportunity in the upcoming bull market in the PMs and the resource sector 
Novo Wakes Up
Another little surprise yesterday was Novo Resources Corp  OTC NSRPF  busting a move  Again  over the weekend I noted that it appeared that the worst may be over and it was prepping to reverse its trend and start heading higher  Hopefully it will have the legs to break above the channel in the chart below 

Yesterday  Norilsk  OTC NILSY  wasted no time reasserting itself  This is our little core nickel play  It s considered a safe way to play the battery metal EV theme 

Big Base Big Move

Getting Serious About Silver
I have to tell you that this realization has just hit me like a 2x4 in the head  Frankly it is totally counter to my understanding of the fundamentals of silver and how it fits into the big picture of the sequence of which asset classes perform first in a new bull market 
It has always been my understanding that silver is the latecomer to the party  That s the way it has been in the past  After all   silver is chiefly an industrial metal since its traditional monetary role has faded 
So when an economy enters a recession  silver should weaken  right  After the devastating bear market from 1929 1932 silver actually bottomed 6 months after the Dow  Whereas the Dow completed its 89  decline in July 1932  silver continued declining until December 1932 
When the gold stocks bottomed in January 2016  the silver stocks severely lagged the gold stocks for the first 6 weeks of the rally 
So it s normal that silver comes along later and puts in its big gains once the market gets going  That s the consensus since that s how it has been in the past  But here is the value of chartology  it tells us real time if something different is happening 
It appears to me that the silver stocks are getting ready to begin their advance in the next phase of the bull market  They actually appear very bullish as they have the appearance of being in the later phase of their consolidation of the big move of their phase I advance 
The Most Important Trait of a Successful Investor Patience
This past week I noticed several comments on the forum expressing frustration that the PM stocks were not acting like they were  supposed  to  If inflation goes up the PM stocks should immediately respond as well 
When the stock market goes down gold stocks are supposed to go up right  Let me just say that we all need to have some patience  These things take time  we can t be in the instant gratification business  In the future I plan on writing a piece explaining the dynamics of what makes the gold stocks run in a bull market  But for now let s just trust the charts and see what they are saying 
Gold and Silver  what we would expect
We have discussed before that gold and silver began their bull market in December 2015  They both had a great phase I rally into late July 2016  Gold then corrected and consolidated this move over the next 6 months and put in its correction bottom in December 2016  That was an 18 6  decline 
It then began Phase II of its bull market where it remains today  Silver also peaked in July 2016  but it took an entire year  until July 2017 to correct the first leg up  That correction or consolidation gave back 32 6  of its first leg up 
It appears silver is now in the early stages of its bull market phase II  Therefore we can see these metals have performed as we would have expected  Gold rallied 31  whereas the more volatile silver rallied 55   When the corrections came  gold lost 18 6  in 6 months while silver lost 32 6  in 12 months  This is classic behavior 

Silver is playing catch up  but getting ready to romp 

One more thing  we are in a real bull market here  although early stages  It s the real deal  Just look at the thin blue volume line on both charts representing the 30 W EMA of volume  It is in a constant expansion 
Volume rises in a real bull market  It is noteworthy that volume has slowly declined in the S P over the past 9 years  hmm

But here is where we need to sit up and pay attention  The silver stocks now appear  as a group  to be ready to finish the correction they have been in for the past 18 months  Where I have been content to think the bottom in these stocks will likely come during the seasonal doldrums of late summer whenthe PMs usually go to sleep  it appears the turn up may be sooner than that 
The Long Term Monthly Charts  big picture jumps right off the page
After the decline of most stocks over the past 2 weeks  the daily chart patterns of the silver stocks look particularly gruesome  Looking at these charts does not motivate one to go right out and buy these things  Frankly they are downright ugly 
But here is the thing when one looks at the monthly charts  some of these patterns simply jump right off the page and say buy me now 
MAG Silver
MAG Silver Corp   NYSE MAG  was named my Blue Ribbon silver pick in the year end edition  In the chart below we take a long term 10 year monthly look at MAG  OMG is this a thing of beauty 
Understand the principle of coiled energy and when it is released it powers a move  MAG coiled energy for 7 years inside of that big triangle  The BT to its breakout of its horizontal triangle has been ongoing for two years now  Furthermore the recent drop below the upper triangle line is likely a classic washout move just before it launches on its power drive  IMO the chartology here is telling us this is a perfect entry position 

Looking at the weekly chart we have to ask  could this simply be a half way pattern  When MAG began it was founder Dr  Peter Megaw s purpose to find a silver deposit that would be profitable at  4 silver since that was back in the early 2000 s before silver made its advance  MAG is super grade 

Fortuna  Monthly
In Fortuna Silver Mines  NYSE FSM  again we have a long term chart that jumps right off the page  Fortuna has bored me to death over the past year  Now I understand why  It is simply taking its time to build its BT base and getting into stronger hands for the big move ahead 

Fortuna Weekly 

Fortuna not only mines silver but also massive high grade zinc  Zinc will come into its own this year  Note yesterday it broke above its 30 W EMA  nice 
Pan American  Ross Beaties  Powerhouse
The monthly on Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS  shows a nice bull flag consolidation  It has been ongoing for just under two years  When it breaks out they have lots of upside leverage 

The Weekly shows the resistance to giving up any ground 

Again I am not going to be displaying the daily charts as the noise in them detracts from the big picture 
Below I will show numerous weekly charts of silver companies that are in different stages of finishing up their long correction  You can see that there remains little time before the big moves begin

One of the key things to remind oneself of is that over the past two weeks with the markets crashing all around  these stocks have remained in their consolidation patterns  No technical damage on the weekly charts 
This is very encouraging and speaks to the case that these stocks have absorbed all the punishment intact and they are in stronger hands now  They are ready to advance  Can you say the same for the average stock in the S P 500 ",2018-02-15,Plunger (Burt Coons),https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-night-report-its-time-to-get-serious-about-silver-200290660,200290660
158052,379568,PAAS,5 Top Stocks With Solid Earnings Acceleration,opinion,Right from the top brass to research analysts  earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price  But  earnings acceleration works even better in boosting the stock price Future OutperformersEarnings acceleration helps you select stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet and consequently are on the verge of solid price appreciation  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates  However  in case of earnings growth you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price Increase in the percentage of earnings growth convinces us about the fundamental soundness of the company  A sideways percentage of earnings growth  on the other hand  indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  If the earnings growth percentage moderates  share prices are more likely to tank So  what is earnings acceleration  It is the incremental growth in a company s earnings per share  EPS   In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be called earnings acceleration This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance Screening Parameters Let s pick stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter

158053,379569,PAAS,Profit Margins Crushed At Largest Primary Silver Mining Company,opinion,"The profit margin trend at the world s largest primary silver mining company has experienced a rapid decline over the past several years  Fresnillo PLC  MX FRES  in Mexico  is the largest primary silver mining company in the world  Last year  Fresnillo PLC produced 47 million of silver and 762 000 oz of gold 
For all their hard work  Fresnillo s profit margin versus its cost of sales fell to an all time low of 7  in 2015  This can most certainly be blamed on market intervention  which I will discuss in more detail in upcoming articles 
The chart below shows how the company s cost of sales has increased to  1 01 billion while their attributable profit fell to only  70 million 

Now compare the huge difference between the 2015 figures to 2005  In 2005  Fresnillo PLC s cost of sales were only  196 million versus their attributable profit of  136 million  Thus  the company s attributable profit margin to their cost of sales was 70   ten times higher than it was in 2015 
Furthermore  Fresnillo PLC produced a lot more silver and gold in 2015 versus 2005 
Fresnillo PLC Silver and Gold Production  Moz   million oz  
2005 Silver production   35 2 Moz
2005 Gold production   277 000 oz
2015 Silver production   47 Moz
2015 Gold production   762 000 oz
Even  though Fresnillo PLC increased their silver production significantly over the past decade  it is their gold production that experienced the most rapid growth  However  the company enjoyed a much higher profit margin on its cost of sales in 2005 when it was producing a lot less gold and silver 
If we look at the chart above  we can clearly see that the attributable profits for years 2013 2015 were about the same as what Fresnillo PLC made from 2005 2008  but  the cost of sales were three to four times less during the early period than they were from 2013 2015 
As we can see  something clearly changed on Fresnillo PLC s income statement after 2012  Again  this was due to market invention by the Federal Reserve and Central Banks via the bullion banks paper trading markets 
That being said  I need to clarify a few things  While the chart above shows Fresnillo PLC s cost of sales  this does not include all their total costs  The cost of sales figures only represent what takes place at the actual mine  If we add additional costs  such as administration  exploration  selling expenses and even income tax  the total  more realistic  cost is much higher 
For example  Fresnillo PLC s additional costs were in 2015 
Administration cost    63 million
Exploration cost    140 million
Selling expenses    14 million
Income tax expense    143 million
Thus  Fresnillo PLC s attributable profit of  70 million was even less at only 5  when we compare it to their total revenue of  1 44 billion 
Fresnillo PLC Capital Expenditures Have Jumped Nearly Eight Times While Profits Evaporated

Fresnillo PLC s capital expenditures were  475 million in 2015 versus  61 million in 2005  The increased capital costs were due to expansion of new projects as well as increased higher sustaining capital costs  It would have been nice for Fresnillo PLC to make better profits on the large amount of capital and money they spend to provide gold and silver to the market 
I stated in the beginning of the article that  Market Invention  was the cause of Fresnillo s deteriorating profit margins  While many things can be blamed on  market intervention  or  manipulation     states that it was done on purpose to keep the public from hoarding physical gold 
Again  I will be writing articles discussing this in detail  However  the primary gold and silver miners are few of the only companies producing REAL WEALTH in the world  It is a shame that  market intervention  is crippling the only industry that provides the world with real wealth 
Lastly  even though I have shown how Fresnillo PLC s profit margin has really fallen in the past several years  I believe this is one of the strongest primary silver and gold mining companies in the world  Most other gold and silver mining companies lost money in the past two three years  but Fresnillo PLC still made some profits 
Furthermore  the best performing mining companies in the future when the GREATEST FINANCIAL PONZI SCHEME in history starts to unravel  will be those who produce mostly gold and silver  What I mean by that is a company s revenue that predominately comes from both gold and silver mining 
For example  Fresnillo PLC s silver and gold metal sales in 2015 accounted for 91  of their total revenues  Compare that to Pan American Silver Corp  NASDAQ PAAS  s 73  of total revenues came from silver and gold metal sales for the same year 
Regardless  the market has no clue just how undervalued physical precious metals are as well as the primary gold and silver miners  When the FIAT MONETARY FAN finally hits the COW EXCREMENT  the market price of these extremely rare assets will surge higher ",2017-01-11,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-intervention-crushed-profit-margins-at-largest-primary-silver-200172095,200172095

158080,379596,PAAS,Forex Critical  Up Is Down And Contrasts Confound,opinion,"Last week was full of important news for forex trading  As a dollar bull  euro bear  and yen bear  the week presented particular challenges that hedging could only soothe a little bit  I had a good run with these positions in recent weeks  As forex goes  a setback was due   just too bad the setbacks piled into the same week 
I start with the Federal Reserve  I assumed no new news would come out of the latest decision on monetary policy and that markets would manage to remain relatively calm in the wake of the news  I was right for a spell  The market interpreted  much more dovishly than I thought it should  In fact  the Fed seemed more resolute than usual  In particular  the Fed made absolutely no mention of Brexit or economic troubles in China 
The Fed even dipped its toe a bit into the realm of confidence when it claimed that  near term risks to the economic outlook have diminished    a clear  albeit indirect  blanket dismissal of the risks of Brexit  China  and others  Yet  with the U S  dollar experiencing recent strength  it was setup for selling and profit taking  The dollar s subsequent decline really accelerated with another  disappointment  from the Bank of Japan  BoJ  on Thursday night and then a notably weak U S  Q2 GDP report of 1 2   market  expectations  were for 2 5   on Friday morning  The bullish breakout for the U S  dollar index is over before it could generate much follow through momentum 

The U S  dollar index craters through 200DMA support and even briefly breaks 50DMA support 
The dollar is roughly following the trends in expectations for the next rate hike from the Fed  These odds have become volatile again  Market bettors are once again in full retreat on expectations for the next rate hike  For a brief moment just a week and a half ago  expectations had moved back into 2016  Now  they are pushed far into 2017 again 
In the span of 9 days  the market has gone from a December rate hike as the most likely scenario to a  might as well be never  scenario yet again 
Last week s  dollar dovish  action had a notable impact on the SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD   Once again  GLD escaped a confirmation of a top with the Fed coming to the rescue  Going into the Fed   having just erased all its incremental post Brexit gains  Now  it looks like that level is providing support for the next leg up 
The uptrend remains in place for SPDR Gold Shares  GLD  

The Fed and then weak GDP even helped iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NYSE TLT   Looks like I made a fortuitous bet  a hedge  on TLT call spreads near the most recent low 
Speculators have finally gotten a little more cautious on gold even as bullishness on silver continues higher  It is quite the mixed message  but the mix is quite consistent with the contrasts that are roiling forex trading   Note that I finally sold my position in Pan American Silver Corp  NASDAQ PAAS  but still hold a core iShares Silver Trust  NYSE SLV  position  
Gold speculators have pulled back on net longs for the third consecutive week  but remain near highs not seen since at least 2008 

Silver speculators have NOT received the memo from gold speculators and continue to ramp net longs to new 8  year highs 
The forex market seems to always be on the hunt for an excuse to buy the euro  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Euro  NYSE FXE    and the Fed apparently gave them one  The U S  s disappointingly weak GDP contrasted sharply with a eurozone GDP that beat  expectations  of 1 5  with a 1 6  print  I am sure this contrast added to the upward pressure on EUR USD  Moreover  speculators had just finished pushing bearish euro bets to their highest level since late January  Speculators are clearly anticipating weakness  not strength  in the eurozone outlook as last week marked the fourth consecutive week of gains on net shorts 
EUR USD pushes through important technical resistance at its 50 and 200DMAs 
Speculators continue an impressive build up of bets against the euro  The change of heart began in earnest with May s peak 
The Australian dollar  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar  NYSE FXA   continues to add to the contrasting forex messages  The currency has shown resilience even as the market expects another rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  at its August meeting  The odds for a rate cut at the August meeting are now at 64   They were as high as 70  in the previous week  In the last week  speculators maintained net bullish positions which got more bold in the prior week  I was unfortunate enough to set a stop sell upon AUD USD breaking support at the 50DMA  That lasted for all of a few minutes  if that    I guess too many other traders either had the same idea or too many AUD USD longs had stops set that market markers and algos successfully busted before taking AUD USD higher again  I am sticking with a short bias going into the RBA meeting as long as the currency remains so strong  Contrary is the name of the game right now 

Market expectations for an August rate cut from the RBA have run relatively since soon after the July RBA meeting 

Speculators got more bullish on the Australian dollar even as expectations for an August rate but remain strong 
AUD USD had a quick  and bearish  breakdown below 50DMA support before swiftly turning higher again 
The Canadian dollar  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar  NYSE FXC   is another currency of surprising contrasts  Oil prices have noticeably weakened over recent weeks  At the same time  speculators have increased net longs back to levels at their highest of the year and levels last seen in early January  Perhaps speculators are anticipating an imminent end to this modest slide in oil  However a small miss in May GDP suggests oil s decline could presage worse results for June  the month oil prices last peaked 
Oil prices reached a peak in June and have persistently declined since then 

The United States Oil  NYSE USO  has broken down in the wake of declining oil prices 

Undeterred by declining oil prices  speculators are rebuilding net longs on the Canadian dollar 
USD CAD briefly broke through its recent trading range  title  USD CAD briefly broke through its recent trading range  height  242  width  474  
USD CAD briefly broke through its recent trading range only to turn around for a retest of the slightly uptrending 50DMA 
Currency traders have the Japanese trapped in a box at this point  There was a lot of hype and anticipation about    going into the Bank of Japan s  BoJ   The helicopters failed to get off the ground as the BoJ instead chose  just  to increase the piles of yen being spent to buy ETFs   The Bank will purchase ETFs so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 6 trillion yen  almost double the previous pace of about 3 3 trillion yen    Also contrast the BoJ s assessment of global economic risks to the Fed s 

 Against the backdrop of the United Kingdom s vote to leave the European Union and the slowdown in emerging economies  uncertainties surrounding overseas economies have increased and volatile developments have continued in the global financial markets  In order to prevent these uncertainties from leading to a deterioration in business confidence and consumer sentiment as well as to ensure smooth funding in foreign currencies by Japanese firms and financial institutions  thereby supporting their proactive economic activities  at the Monetary Policy Meeting  MPM  held today  the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following  

So while the BoJ continues along a path of historic monetary easing and a massive run up in its balance sheet  the market finds itself so disappointed that the yen surged in value once again  For this cycle  the worse the outlook for Japan  the more loved the yen  What is down is really up 

Ironically  the BoJ s epic futility began with its bold move to go negative to start the year  Now  the market has made a sport out of buying yen in response to anything the BoJ does 

Speculators backed off net long positions going into the BoJ meeting  Overall  they remain firmly bullish on the yen 

The Bank of Japan leads central banks in the accumulation of assets  The latest data are from 2013  Since then  the Fed has leveled off while the BoJ has continued to accumulate in the face of on going economic weakness 
Note that on Friday  I reloaded monthly FXY put options expiring in August  I had such phenomenal success betting on the late June early July top on CurrencyShares Japanese Yen ETF  NYSE FXY   I could not resist fading this latest FXY rally  If the rally continues  I will try again around 100 for USD JPY  USD JPY is currently at 102 
The forex market  including gold and silver  contains a hot cauldron of contrasts with sometimes confounding cause and effect  Crowded trades are showing a surprising capacity to get ever more crowded  Traders continue to show a high capacity for confounding and flouting central banks  Economic data are volatile and cause quick changes in short term opinions  In this environment  traders need to be flexible  be willing to think contrary  and think along multiple timeframes  Risk management is also paramount  I am always trying to improve on all counts

158081,379597,PAAS,2 Silver Mining Stocks For A Shinier Portfolio  PAAS   HL ,opinion,Precious metals have hogged the limelight this year  with gold and silver being the major movers  In fact the precious white metal has clearly outshone the bullion  clocking a 35  gain so far compared to gold s 23  rise Worries over the global economy  Brexit induced equity market volatility  the U S  Federal Reserve s move to maintain steady interest rates so far and the introduction of negative interest rates by several central banks boosted growth of these safe haven assets  Despite the recent prospects of a likely rate hike by the Fed in Dec 2016  silver has remained close to its highs Demand Prospects StrongSilver has varied industrial applications which drive its demand significantly  Industrial demand for silver is set to increase from 54  last year  Solar power is replacing conventional power sources and might even account for more than 13  of total industrial demand for silver in 2016  The demand from ethylene oxide producers is expected to jump more than 25  year over year Demand in jewelry fabrication is expected to increase by 5  and coin demand will likely be robust this year  Increased interest in safe haven assets will also drive physical silver investment demand  India will emerge as a major consumer driven by increased investor interest and growth in jewelry  decorative items and silverware fabrication Supply Likely to Trickle DownGlobal mine supply production is projected to fall 5  in 2016   the first drop in global silver mine production since 2002  The soft price environment in the prior years had deterred producers to invest in expanding capacity at existing operations  Moreover  silver scrap supply  which has been on the decline for several years  should further weaken in 2016  Going forward  global silver mine production is expected to slump through 2019 as primary silver production from more mature operations starts to meander Thus  we are looking at a potential silver deficit  which in turn provides a solid ground for silver price gains this year  Price appreciation will also be supported by a flight to safety amid volatile equity markets

from the complete list of  is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  86 and lower  is positive  the middle one third  between  87 and  172  is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one third  Rank  173 and higher  is negative  Currently  the silver mining industry is in the top tier with a Zacks Industry Rank of  11  indicating a positive outlook The

158083,379599,PAAS,5 Mining Stocks To Buy On Strong Momentum,opinion,"Last year  the slowdown in China and the subsequent crash in commodity prices had left miners in a lurch  Miners saw millions being wiped out and  in the wake of falling demand  the only way to stay afloat was to cost control  Saddled with debt  most miners had to sell off underperforming assets  This year  the mining industry seems to be on a better footing  having staged a comeback What Has Turned the Tide This Year This year  gold and silver have been major movers  Worries over the global economy  Brexit induced volatile equity markets  the Federal Reserve s stance to maintain steady interest rates and the introduction of negative interest rates by several central banks boosted growth of these safe haven assets Gold prices are generally aided by retail demand for the metal in the latter part of the year  as it is a seasonally strong period in countries like India and China  Robust industrial demand and dwindling supplies for silver also sets the stage for silver prices to rise further Copper prices have seen steady gains in 2016  halting the steady decline in prices over the past five years  Demand has been relatively robust with imports from China  responsible for nearly half of the global trade  hitting records during the first half of 2016  Demand for copper will remain strong  backed by its widespread use in transportation  manufacturing and construction  limited supplies from existing mines  and the absence of new significant development projects For aluminum  automotive  packaging and airline industries are anticipated to support demand  India appears promising given its currently low levels of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth  With demand being strong  the industry needs to pull the reins on supply  which will lead to deficits for a prolonged period and create the ground for higher aluminum prices  going forward The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel today and  consequently  of iron ore  In the U S   an improving job market and a strong housing sector will lead to 3 2  growth in steel demand this year What Does the Crystal Ball Predict As per the Zacks Industry classification  the mining industry is grouped under the Basic Material sector   one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  Though sector growth will remain in the negative territory in the third quarter  a dip of 2 3  projected for the quarter which is not that steep compared to the previous drop

158110,379626,PAAS,iShares Silver Trust Breaks Out On Maximum Bullishness,opinion,"Last week s report from the CFTC s Commitments of Traders shows that speculators ramped up net longs on silver to levels unseen since at least 2008  I call this  maximum bullishness   The trend is in  peaks in silver bullishness keep growing higher and higher   

Since June 2014  the peaks in run ups of net longs have generally trended higher and higher  Those buying sprees did not deliver lasting bottoms until the last trough last December and January  As iShares Silver Trust  NYSE SLV  began its latest rally in February  speculators quickly went to net 60K long contracts  Last week  they finally hit a new high of 71 4K net long contracts  That milestone was accompanied by a gap up and breakout of SLV 

The iShares Silver Trust  SLV  has gained 23  year to date but is still only at an 11 month high 
Overall  sentiment looks strong and healthy for SLV  where buying the dips makes a lot of sense  I continue to hold a core SLV position  and in miner Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS   and occasionally trade in SLV call options  I sold the last call options into last week s big move upward  I am now waiting for Wednesday s Federal Reserve meeting before deciding what to do next  However  I am guessing if SLV fills its last gap up  I will treat the move as my next buying opportunity for a swing trade

158111,379627,PAAS,5 Reasonably Priced Breakout Stocks ,opinion,"Picking breakout stocks is probably one of the basic techniques that active investors use  The logic to this kind of stock selection is to determine which stocks are trading within a narrow channel  Such stocks are to be purchased as soon as they move above this band and are sold when they fall below  In case a stock moves above this band  it usually gains momentum 
Market watchers caution against incorrectly timing such a move  This is because of the significant risk of identifying stock movements as breakouts  which in reality are not so  At the same time  when this strategy is utilized judiciously  it yields substantive gains  which is the reason why it remains popular 
Determining Breakout Levels
The key to this strategy is calculating the support and resistance levels of a stock  The floor of the stock s trading channel is its support level and it should be sold as soon as it threatens to fall lower  On the other hand  the resistance is its breakout level and it is poised to gain substantially if breaks the resistance level 
When a stock is close to its support level  demand is literally hitting the floor  On the other hand demand rises when it is breaching its resistance level  signaling that this is the right time to make a lucrative addition to your portfolio  The idea is to pick stocks which have just broken above their resistance barriers or are very closing to doing so 
Screening Parameters
  Percentage price change over four weeks between 10  and 20   Stocks which are showing considerable price increases  but whose gains are not excessive  
  Current Price  52 Week High greater than or equal to 0 9  Stocks which are trading 90  close to their 52 week highs  
  Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  
  Beta for 60 months less than or equal to 2  Stocks which move by a greater degree than the broader market but within a reasonable limit  
  Current price less than or equal to  15  Stocks which are reasonably priced  
These criteria narrow down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 11 
Here are the top 5 stocks that meet these criteria

158112,379628,PAAS,Gold Juniors  Q1 16 Fundamentals,opinion,"The smaller gold mining and exploration stocks have enjoyed an amazing year  soaring with gold s new bull market  Many have more than doubled since mid January  and some have more than tripled at best in that short span  Are such spectacular gains fundamentally justified  or merely the result of ephemeral sentiment that could vanish anytime  The gold juniors  recently reported Q1 16 results offer great insights 
The junior gold miners and explorers play a critical role in the world gold market  They bear the major costs and risks associated with discovering and sometimes developing new economically viable gold deposits  They painstakingly find the new gold reserves to offset the constant depletion of the world s existing gold mines  acting as the headwaters feeding the global mined gold supply pipeline vital to this industry 
The larger gold miners rely extensively on the juniors  crucial exploration and early development work to maintain and replenish their own operations  While the majors certainly do their own exploration  it is far from sufficient to offset existing gold mines exhausting  So gold juniors are constantly targeted by the larger miners  which acquire these companies outright  buy their projects  or partner with them for development 
These smaller gold miners and especially explorers are far riskier than the major gold miners  Gold juniors usually only have one operating mine or one major high potential exploration project  With all their eggs often in one basket  they lack the major miners  diversification across mines  projects  and their geopolitical jurisdictions  And naturally bearing much more risk  juniors must have higher potential returns 
It s interesting to consider how juniors  risk reward dynamic has played out so far in 2016 in broad terms  through the lenses of the primary vehicles investors use to own precious metals stocks  Today 3 leading ETFs dominate this industry  The GDX VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX  includes the world s biggest and best gold miners  the majors  At best between mid January and late April  it soared 107 1  higher 
The leading silver stock ETF is the Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL  ETF  which naturally focuses on the elite silver miners  It skyrocketed a staggering 144 3  higher at best between mid January and mid May  trouncing GDX s gains  Silver outperforming gold and silver stocks outperforming gold stocks is exactly what you d expect  Silver is a much smaller market than gold  effectively leveraging capital inflows into it 
And the last dominant gold stock ETF is of course the GDXJ VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDXJ   Junior gold miners and explorers are much riskier than diversified gold or silver majors  so they should have higher returns to compensate  GDXJ has blasted an impressive 129 4  higher at best between mid January and mid May  so it has somewhat outperformed GDX but is lagging well behind SIL s lead 
There are a couple likely reasons  Gold s new bull market fueling these massive precious metals stock gains has barely begun after this metal slumped to a major 6 1 year secular low in mid December the day after the Fed s first rate hike in 9 5 years  Since gold juniors are riskier  they generally aren t preferred early in bull markets when investors remain skeptical  Their popularity soars later as established bulls mature 
And as of the middle of this week  GDX  SIL  and GDXJ had net assets of  7 2b   0 3b  and  2 7b  As SIL is so small compared to the much better known and established GDX and GDXJ  it takes less capital to catapult it higher  By the time we near the ends of these overdue mean reversion bull markets in both gold and silver in a couple years or so  odds are the junior golds  performance will again dwarf that of the majors 
As a speculator and investor  I need to understand which precious metals stocks are likely to prove the top performers as gold and silver power higher  So after quarter ends  I dig deep into the latest results of the world s best gold and silver miners and explorers  These quarterly filings aren t due until 45 days following quarter ends  so I ve spent recent weeks up to my eyeballs painstakingly analyzing dozens of 10 Qs 
The gold standard for precious metals stocks is to be included in GDX  SIL  or GDXJ by their managers  These ETF companies have sizable dedicated research teams that wade through the many hundreds of precious metals stocks out there to skim off the heaps of dross and uncover this industry s best  So the component lists of these dominant ETFs are an excellent place to start when researching fundamentals 
Today s essay is the third and final of a post quarterly trilogy  Two weeks ago I dug into the GDX gold miners  Q1 16 fundamentals in depth  Last week I applied a similar analysis to the SIL silver miners  Q1 16 fundamentals  And now it s the GDXJ junior gold miners  and explorers  turn  How did these companies actually fare in the first quarter  which was very important emerging out of Q4 s secular lows 
As of the middle of this week  GDXJ had a whopping 46 component companies  That s problematic  heavily over diversified  A smaller focused portfolio consisting of about 20 stocks with the most superior fundamentals will greatly outperform a larger one padded with lesser stocks  I believe GDXJ s investors would greatly benefit from a culling of this ETF s excessive holdings  And it would actually be easy to do 
This week I looked at the top 34 GDXJ components  Q1 16 quarterly reports filed by mid May  That number fits in our standard sized tables below  These 34 largest GDXJ component stocks accounted for 93 0  of this ETF s total weighting  But as I analyzed them  I was struck by how many of these stocks are also included in GDX and or SIL  These cross holdings seem counterproductive for all 3 of these leading ETFs 
Investors buy GDX because they want to own larger gold stocks  and GDXJ specifically for the smaller and riskier junior golds  They shouldn t have the same holdings  as it is easy to make a distinction between larger and smaller gold miners  Both these ETFs are managed by the same company  so it would be pretty simple for their managers to agree on some definition to separate juniors from majors 
I d make this production based  If a company produced less than 200k ounces of gold over the latest 4 quarters for example  it could be considered a junior eligible for GDXJ inclusion if gold accounted for the majority of its trailing twelve month revenues  If a company produced more than 200k ounces over the rolling past year  it could instead be considered for potential GDX inclusion if gold was its primary business 
The holdings of GDX and GDXJ really should be mutually exclusive  otherwise these ETFs are actively misleading investors with their names  I was very dismayed this week to find that 13 of GDXJ s top 34 holdings were also included in GDX  Even worse  these 13 duplicate holdings accounted for a truly shocking 50 0  of GDXJ s total weightings this week  GDXJ is now a half GDX clone  not a junior vehicle 
VanEck runs both these ETFs and really needs to fix this so investors can have more responsive options that hold true to these ETFs  names and advertising  While VanEck doesn t run SIL  I d further argue that silver miners have no place in ETFs billed as gold stock ETFs  12 of GDXJ s top 34 holdings are also included in SIL  and accounted for 35 7  of GDXJ s weightings this week  But wait  it gets even crazier 
GDXJ s top holding this week was the amazing First Majestic Silver  NYSE AG   the world s purest major silver miner as discussed last week in my look at SIL components  Q1 16 fundamentals  And Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS   GDXJ s fourth largest holding this week  is the second purest major silver miner that tops SIL s recent weightings  Are investors buying an ETF specifically for junior golds wanting to own major silver miners instead 
And it s not like GDXJ s managers don t actively manage its holdings  The differences between the weightings and even some of the companies between my last GDXJ analysis of Q4 15 fundamental data in early March and this week was enormous  With many dozens of excellent juniors to pick from out of the many hundreds out there  there s no reason GDXJ should be laden with major gold and silver miners 
Nevertheless these GDXJ components are the definitive list of elite  junior golds   so I dived into all of their Q1 16 reports just released by mid May  Each of these top 34 components  stock symbols  exchange listings GDXJ is using  GDXJ s weightings as of this week  market caps  and P E ratios are listed below  That s followed by their cash costs and all in sustaining costs per ounce in Q1 16  and full year AISC guidance 
Next comes components  cash balances at the end of Q1 16  cash s percentage of their current market capitalizations  and first quarter s cash flows generated from operations  Finally Q1 16 s production is listed in ounces  Numbers under 300k are gold  and all are in total equivalent ounces if reported by the companies for their primary metal  A gold miner also producing silver often converts it into gold equivalent terms 
Thus if you compare these tables with my last couple essays on GDX and SIL components  there may be different production numbers  For GDX and SIL  I used pure gold and silver production whenever it was reported  But for GDXJ which is supposed to have a gold junior focus  it made more sense to shift to gold equivalent terms  If a company produced 0k ounces in Q1 16  it is still an explorer with no mining operations 


As the gold stock  experts  CNBC brings on like to point out  the price to earnings ratios in this sector are crazy  The gold miners are either largely losing money or trading at extreme P E ratios  But this critical valuation metric is very misleading today  As discussed in depth a couple weeks ago in my GDX essay  trailing twelve month GAAP earnings reflect large non cash write downs from last year s secular gold lows 
Though such write downs are required by accounting conservatism  they serve to obscure what is really happening on the operating front  Once those write downs roll off the latest 4 quarters  results  these trailing twelve month P E ratios of the gold miners are going to collapse  I included this column today primarily as a reference for when this GDXJ component fundamental research is furthered after future quarters 
Back in Q4 15 as gold slumped to that miserable 6 1 year secular low of  1051 by mid December  its average price that quarter was just  1105  That was the worst seen since Q4 09  Such low gold prices fueled extreme bearishness  so junior golds  stock prices were driven down to levels suggesting this whole industry was on the verge of bankruptcy  Somewhat paradoxically  Q1 16 wasn t much of an improvement 
Though gold enjoyed a spectacular 16 1  rally in Q1  which was its best quarter since way back in Q3 1986  its average price still only climbed 7 3  to just  1185  Such levels still generate much unease  since as recently as last summer  1200 was erroneously believed to be the breakeven cost for the gold mining industry  Yet again  the junior golds  excellent Q1 16 operating results proved that was wildly off base 
Cash costs are gold miners  acid test for survival  the breakeven level required to pay the ongoing operating expenses necessary to produce gold  They include all cash necessary to mine each ounce of gold  This includes all direct production costs  mine level administration  smelting  refining  transport  regulatory  royalty  and tax expenses  As long as gold trades above cash costs  miners face no existential threat 
In Q1 16 the elite GDXJ gold juniors  cash costs averaged just  654 per ounce  While that s up 4 1  from Q4 15 s average  it s still radically below not only prevailing gold prices but gold s major secular low of mid December  Gold could fall to an apocalyptic level of  700  which seems all but impossible given today s bullish supply and demand situation  and the junior gold miners could still weather it for a long time 
And don t read too much into that Q1 16 rise in gold juniors  cash costs  My last essay on the GDXJ components  Q4 15 fundamentals only had data current to early March  The filing deadline for annual reports ending fiscal years is 90 days  twice the usual quarterly 45 day one  due to the need for fully audited financial statements and challenging to prepare comprehensive 10 K reports required by the SEC 
I did that last analysis before all the year end data was in because there was still serious concern about the fundamental state of the junior gold miners then  So the Q4 15 numbers for the junior golds aren t as comprehensive as these new Q1 16 ones gathered after all but two companies reported  South Africa s Harmony Gold  NYSE HMY  only reports in 6 month intervals  and Silvercorp Metals   OTC SVMLF  fiscal year ended on March 31st 
A more interesting comparison is the Q1 16 cash costs per ounce of the GDXJ components mining gold compared to the GDX components  which averaged  583  It s pretty impressive the juniors with their often single mine focus and non existent economies of scale can operate at average cash costs only 12 2  higher than the elite majors   The junior golds are doing an outstanding job managing their costs 
But cash costs are misleading  as it takes far more capital expenditures to run gold mining companies as going concerns  All the gold mined is constantly depleting deposits  so new ones have to be found and developed to maintain current production levels  And old exhausted mines need to be reclaimed  So in June 2013  the World Gold Council introduced far superior all in sustaining costs to measure mining costs 
All in sustaining costs include everything necessary to maintain and replenish gold mining operations at current production levels  This includes all direct cash costs of mining gold  along with all corporate level administration that always should ve been included in cash costs  But AISC extend way beyond that to encompass the entire mining cycle  making them a far more realistic representation of true costs 
So AISC also include exploration for new gold to mine  the huge mine development and construction expenses necessary to bring new mines online  remediation  and reclamation  As long as gold prices remain above all in sustaining costs  the junior gold miners can continue to produce at current levels indefinitely  And GDXJ s top 34 component companies reported impressively low AISC in Q1 16 
They averaged just  893 per ounce  a massive  292 below the first quarter s  1185 average gold price  That compares favorably with GDX s top 34 components averaging  833 AISC in Q1 16  While it isn t yet reflected in their P E ratios  the elite junior gold miners are already very profitable  And they expect their AISC to fall considerably this year  with average 2016 projections running quite a bit lower at  866 
The primary thing that makes gold stock investment so appealing is the great leverage to gold of these gold mining profits  Gold mining costs are largely fixed during each mine s planning stages  That s when mining engineers decide which ore bodies to extract  how to dig to them  and how to process that ore to recover the gold  So as prevailing gold prices rise  mining costs generally don t climb along with them 
So far in Q2 16  gold has averaged  1253 per ounce  This is another 5 7  better than Q1 s average  And at  1253 gold and Q1 s  893 average AISC among the elite gold juniors  operating profits soar 23 3  to  360 per ounce  That s 4 1x leverage to gold even on a minor move  Throughout the entire stock markets  stock prices ultimately migrate to some reasonable multiple of their underlying corporate profits 
The tough gold price environment in recent years wasn t normal  but an extreme anomaly driven by the Fed s gross distortions of the financial markets  The last normal year for gold was 2012  which was not even particularly strong as this metal ground sideways to lower after peaking in 2011  Yet gold prices still averaged  1669 per ounce in 2012  a level they will almost certainly mean revert back to in the coming years 
Such totally normal levels are highly likely again as the Fed s artificial stock market levitation inevitably fails and rolls over into the overdue new cyclical bear  Weaker stock markets will rekindle demand for alternative investments led by gold  which moves counter to stocks  Investors will flock back to gold for prudent portfolio diversification  something we re already seeing this year  Regaining 2012 levels is no stretch 
At 2012 s average  1669 gold price and Q1 16 s average  893 AISC  gold juniors  profits would rocket an incredible 165 9  higher on a mere 36 4  rally in gold from this week s levels  This vast potential for extreme profits growth fueling radically higher stock prices is why junior gold stocks are so alluring  The coming gains in this sector as gold mean reverts higher are going to be gigantic  multiplying investors  wealth 
And Q1 16 s actual  292 per ounce average operating profits among the junior gold miners prove that their stocks  extreme early 2016 rally was indeed fundamentally justified  Back in late 2015  this entire sector was left for dead and trading at apocalyptic fundamentally absurd levels  The junior gold miners already enjoying big 24 6  operating margins on average in Q1 argues their mean reversion is righteous 
The already wide gap between prevailing gold prices and all in sustaining costs generally fueled strong cash generation from operations  as seen in the second to last column in these tables  The only gold juniors that didn t see good operating cash flows were the ones ramping up new mines to commercial production and of course the explorers  Exploration stage companies naturally have nothing to sell yet 
These strong Q1 16 operating cash flows from the junior golds boosted impressive treasuries across the top GDXJ components  Most were running large cash balances relative to their market capitalizations  at much higher percentages compared to the top GDX components  This not only protects these smaller gold miners from any normal healthy gold correction  but enables them to ramp capital spending to boost production 
So despite the serious skepticism remaining out there about the outlook for the junior gold miners  they really enjoyed an excellent first quarter operationally  Their fundamentals are strong  and the best of the smaller gold miners and explorers are well positioned to greatly leverage gold s mean reversion bull market gains in the coming years  Each quarter gold rallies on balance  their results will get better and better 
With both gold and silver in confirmed new bull markets for the first time since 2011  experienced investors who understand the risks inherent in junior gold mining and exploration should be looking into this high potential sector  While owning GDXJ grants some exposure  it s certainly not a pure junior gold ETF thanks to the heavy weighting of larger gold miners and silver majors that its managers inexplicably include 
The greatest gains among the junior golds will come from the small miners and explorers with the best fundamentals  While GDXJ includes plenty of these  their collective weighting is relatively low  There are some GDXJ components that are amazing  and others I wouldn t touch with a ten foot pole  There s no doubt an expertly handpicked portfolio of the best gold juniors will trounce the future performance of GDXJ 
The bottom line is the junior gold miners  fundamentals proved very strong in just reported Q1 16  They were able to mine gold at all in sustaining costs several hundred dollars per ounce under the still low prevailing gold prices  These low costs are already fueling excellent and surging operating margins  which will eventually be reflected in falling P E ratios  The gold juniors are ready to greatly leverage gold s bull 
Unfortunately most investors fail to take advantage of their enormous upside potential relative to gold early on  Junior golds are largely shunned early in new bulls when disbelief remains high  But that s the best time to buy them low before they eventually grow popular again and their stock prices soar  As always  the smart contrarians who buy in ahead of the herd will enjoy the greatest gains in gold s new bull ",2016-05-29,Adam Hamilton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-juniors’-q1’16-fundamentals-200132784,200132784

158129,379645,PAAS,Some Hope For The Gold Bulls,opinion,"Charts created using Omega TradeStation 2000i  Chart data supplied by Dial Data
In the previous week s Chart of the Week  I mused as to whether there was the potential for another drop for Gold in the works  The thought that gold could once again put in another scary plunge was based on the premise that there was the eerie similarity between the pattern that is currently forming and the pattern that formed from September 2011 until April 2013  On April 12  2013  some 400 500 tonnes of goldwere offered at the open in thin market conditions on the COMEX the futures exchange that trades gold  The result was a  200 meltdown for gold  The gold sale had a value of roughly  23 billion 
In Q1 2013  the notional amount of gold derivatives outstanding for US banks jumped about  20 billion to  148 billion from Q4 2012 as reported by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  OCC   During Q2 the notional amount of gold derivatives outstanding fell by almost  27 billion  The short sale was made in the early part of Q2 so it is possible that these positions were all covered by the time Q2 ended on June 30  2014 
Since then the notional amount of gold derivatives outstanding has fallen another  26 billion to Q4 2013  Some 90  of all derivatives are held by only four banks in the US   JP Morgan Chase  Bank of America  Goldman Sachs and Citibank  Other large bank holding companies in the US include Morgan Stanley and HSBC 
One of the constant themes I hear is that the gold market is manipulated and that technicals are largely useless in a manipulated market  Given the recent investigation into the London Gold Fix there is no longer any doubt about manipulation in the gold market  Previous investigations have led to some large financial institutions paying large fines for manipulation related to LIBOR  currency price fixing and energy price fixing  The five banks involved in the London Gold Fix are facing lawsuits and Barclays PLC paid some  26 million  US 44 million  in fines by the British regulator  Traders have been let go on the banks dealing desks and Deutsche Bank has pulled out of the London Gold Fix and is selling its seat on the LME  Other banks involved in the London Gold Fix besides Barclays are Canada s Bank of Nova Scotia  HSBC Holdings PLC and Societe Generale SA 
Chancellor George Osborne of Britain has vowed to make manipulation of markets a criminal offence  Osborne was referring primarily to the currency markets and the LIBOR markets but it was also made clear that it would extend to commodity markets and even to the fixed income market  Regulators are also investigating markets in the US  although to date there has been no investigation of the gold market  The US COMEX  a division of the NYMEX   is where gold is traded  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC  regulates the COMEX  Participants must be registered whether as to a large or small speculator or a commercial  Commercials make up the largest group  Each week the CFTC reports the long and short positions for each group  That is known as the Commitment of Traders report  COT  
Technical analysis remains relevant even in a manipulated market  A pure technical analyst would probably only look at the chart with no idea as to what he may actually be looking at  Patterns form   triangles  wedges etc   support resistance levels becomeevident  indicators can be applied  There were technical signs of a potential breakdown back in gold back in early 2013  However  at the time gold sfundamentals remained positive and that threw numerous analysts off track  Technicals and fundamentals can diverge 
Elliot wave analysis is a form of technical analysis that centres on investor psychology  price action and wave patterns  Elliot wave analysis is rule based and as a result  it can be complex  There are few who are considered experts at Elliot wave analysis  I find it useful to see if there are any emerging big picture patterns  I do not consider myself an expert  There are numerous criticisms of Elliot wave analysis  It can be subjective  vague  and  inconsistent in that wave analysis can have numerous revisions 
The chart of gold shows what appears to be three waves down from the September 2011 high  Wave 1 or a possible A wave bottomed in late December 2011  wave 2 or a possible B wave topped out in October 2012  and  wave three or a possible C wave bottomed in June 2013  The three or C wave appears to have unfolded in five waves  I have labeled them a possible large ABC pattern because waves A and B appear to have unfolded in three waves  which is typical of corrective waves  If the A and B wave unfold in three waves then the C wave typically unfolds in five waves 
Labelling it a large ABC corrective pattern could suggest that the current symmetrical triangle forming is wave 1 of a new bull market  If this is a wave 1 of a new bull market then gold should break up over  1 360 and could have objectives up to  1 600  The current symmetrical triangle pattern would most likely need to be relabelled  Key resistance levels would be seen at  1 400   1 430   1 480 and  1 525 
On the other hand  the forming wave could still be wave 4 in a still unfolding five wave pattern to the downside  Robert Prechter s Elliot wave analysis  believes that the current wave is a wave 4 and not a wave that could be the start of a bull move  A symmetrical triangle typically unfolds in an ABCDE type pattern and so far  the ABCD might be complete  If that is the case wave Ewave could rise to about  1 360 before failing  The breakdown point would be around  1 250 and project down to potential objectives near  1 000  This scenario is similar to what I showed in the previous COTW

The chart of silver shows a possible unfolding five waves to the downside  In many respects the silver chart is hopeful for the bulls if the five wave pattern to the downside is correct  This chart could break out over  20 and potentially have objectives up to at least  26 for the first wave to the upside  Even if silver were to break out over  20 it would not necessarily signal an immediate sharp rise  However  a move to  26 would be significant before a correction could set in 

Charts created using Omega TradeStation 2000i  Chart data supplied by Dial Data
The chart of Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS  could be even more encouraging for the bulls  PAA may have completed five waves to the downside with the last bottom seen at  10 18 in October 2013  There have been three fan lines drawn off the wave 2 high in April 2011  PAA is currently testing the third fan line  PAA may be breaking above the third fan line on June 12  2014  If that proves correct this could be bullish for PAA and for the precious metals markets 
It is interesting that on June 12  2014 that riots are breaking out in Sao Paolo over the spending of  1 billion on the World Cup against the backdrop of millions of Brazilians living in poverty  Islamist insurgents in Iraq have seized some key cities and are working their way towards Baghdad prompting a response from the US that there might need to be a military response  and  finally there was a story that pro Russian separatists have picked up some Russian tanks that are now in Ukraine The Ukrainian government is accusing Russia of invading 
The result of these events has seen oil prices leap over  2  gold prices rise around  13 and the Dow Jones Industrials  DJI  fall over 100 points  Of the three charts shown  only the gold chart is somewhat ambiguous as to what the next move might be  Both the chart of silver and PAA appear to be bullish  After almost three years to the downside  the gold bulls need some hope

158131,379647,PAAS,Chris Thompson  Gold And Silver Miners That Can Make Money Now,opinion,"As much as we d all like significantly higher silver and gold prices  Chris Thompson of Raymond James doesn t expect them  The good news  he argues  is that the relative stability now characterizing the market permits investors to make informed decisions about which companies can build value and demonstrate cash flows at today s prices  In this interview with The Gold Report  Thompson lists a handful of gold and silver miners prepared to do just that 
The Gold Report  In your previous Gold Report interview of Dec  31  2013  you predicted 2014 prices of  1 400 per ounce   1 400 oz  for gold and  25 oz for silver  Do you think that gold and silver can still meet those prices this year 
Chris Thompson  Those figures referred to the high side of the anticipated trading range for both metals  Today  our prediction for the high side in 2014 is  1 350 oz for gold and  22 oz for silver  In other words  we see silver potentially trading up to  22 oz this year but do not imply in any way that we expect silver to average  22 oz this year 
TGR  Several recent Gold Report interviewees have expressed surprise and even astonishment that the deteriorating global political situation combined with continuing weak U S  economic performance has not resulted in significantly higher precious metals prices  What s your view 
CT  We think gold and silver have performed relatively well this year and showed strength toward the end of the second quarter  My feeling is that stronger gold and silver prices that we have seen earlier than anticipated this year is a reflection of global political tensions and maybe just a reminder that we are not out of the woods as far as U S  economic performance is concerned  Earlier is better  and so we look for gold and silver prices to retain most of their gains in the third quarter 
TGR  After gold fell significantly under  1 200 oz  there was a loud chorus to the effect that gold had been overvalued and overbought for a long time  Has this negative atmosphere been dissipated 
CT  It was not just gold bullion that was hurt by this negative atmosphere  It was the gold mining companies in fact  the entire gold industry and its participants 
TGR  Could you elaborate on that CT  What we re seeing at the moment is a restoration of market credibility  especially from the mining company side of things  The mining industry enjoyed for a long time a never ending climate of strengthening metal prices  that was reversed last year  As a result  companies have had to deal with this reverse by slashing costs  revising their operating plans and  frankly  delivering what investors have always wanted from them  real growth and the generation of real cash flows at current metal prices  not growth at any cost 
TGR  The Dow Jones and the S P 500 have continued to hit record highs even as many worry about a bubble  Does it surprise you that precious metals equities have done so poorly in the last three years compared to the broader indices 
CT  Not at all  Because of their dependence on ever higher metals prices  the investment appetite for precious metals equities has been muted  Investors and institutional clients have in fact made money by not investing in precious metals  As you suggest  however  our view is that perhaps clients should start looking for quality  precious metal focused stories that are arguably undervalued today  Indications are that clients have been giving the precious metals sector a second look 
TGR  Do you think that the broader indices are in bubble territory 
CT  My view is that it s all about real return  It doesn t matter what the commodity is or what the company is  So long as companies can offer real returns from doing what they do  and there s a value opportunity in what they can deliver  Companies aren t overvalued  regardless of sector  if they deliver real returns  Also  investors have to be realistic about what returns to be satisfied with 
TGR  With regard to offering real returns  how difficult is it for mining companies to make money at  1 300 oz gold and  20 oz silver CT  There are companies that can make money at those prices and others that will struggle  It comes down to two criteria  The first is a management team that can demonstrate the ability to reduce costs and keep them low  The second is deposits that make sense in today s metal price environment  good grades that come without significant technical challenges 
TGR  What s your favorite junior gold company project 
CT  Asanko Gold Inc   AMEX AKG   We initiated coverage a couple of months ago primarily because of the company s management team  The company has brought together two projects in Ghana  the Obotan and Esaase projects  into one large potential operation  Capital expenditures for Phase 1 of the Asanko gold mine are only  295 million   295M   Phase 1 is fully funded and fully permitted for construction and production 
TGR  Asanko shares are trading around  2 70  Your 52 week target price is  4  On what do you base this valuation CT  We derive our value assessment in this instance from a net asset value estimate at a 5  discount rate  For Asanko  we see initial production occurring in Q2 16  For that year  we forecast 160 000 ounces  160 Koz  gold production at an all in cash cost of about  900 oz  We see that increasing the following year  obviously a full year of production  to over 200 Koz at similar all in cash costs  Then  ultimately  when the project fully ramps up  we see both projects  Phases 1 and 2  offering the potential to deliver over 400 Koz gold production by 2020  Recognizing our metal price forecast of  1 350 oz and a 5  discount rate  this operational and development scenario warrants a value of  4 share  in our opinion 
TGR  You previously predicted several 2014 sector outperformers in silver  Have these companies met your expectations 
CT  Fortuna Silver Mines Inc   NYSE FSM  and Tahoe Resources Inc   NYSE TAHO  have absolutely met my expectations  First Majestic Silver Corp   NYSE AG  has lagged the sector somewhat because of operational redesigns currently occurring at two of its key operations in Mexico  We do  however  see a good value opportunity here and expect First Majestic to catch up somewhat to its peers 
Fortuna is a rare example of a company that operates two mines in two countries efficiently and cost effectively  One of those mines has had tremendous exploration success through the discovery of a new high grade zone 
TGR  Would that be at Caylloma in Peru or San Jose in Mexico 
CT  San Jose  Its new high grade zone  Trinidad North  is within easy reach of existing development  What this means for Fortuna is a tremendous opportunity for organic production growth and cash flow growth  The grade of this new discovery is better than the head grade of its current operation  For example  select assays published July 14 include 399 grams per ton  399 g t  silver and 2 15 g t gold  528 g t silver equivalent  over 13 meters  So Trinidad North will have a very favorable effect on San Jose s overall cost structure and growth profile 
Fortuna is the sort of company we really look for and really like  We see potential here for an additional lift in valuation  That will be determined by its ability to increase San Jose s production capacity beyond the current 2 000 ton per day  2 000 tpd  mill rate 
TGR  What can you tell us about Tahoe s Escobal project in Guatemala CT  The project was commissioned earlier this year  and  by all accounts  its ramp up seems to be going smoothly  Tahoe is a company that offers an exceptionally well qualified and well respected management team  The Escobal asset is an anomaly in many respects in the silver sector  It is a very high grade and a very economically robust project  one that stands to deliver significant cash flow in the near term  So in many respects Tahoe commands a premium valuation in the silver market at the moment for these reasons 
There are a couple of key items that we re looking for from Tahoe by the end of 2014  The first would be  obviously  the completion of its production ramp up to 3 500 tpd  The second would be the declaration of a dividend  which the company had announced previously it intends to deliver  The third would be a balance sheet reorganization  We anticipate that the company will take on a level of debt  which in many respects would be a relatively small component of the company s current capitalization  As far as our outlook for Tahoe goes  while we consider it fairly valued at current metal prices  we recognize the excellent job that management has done in building the industry s largest and most profitable silver projects 
TGR  How do you rate Guatemala as a jurisdiction  especially after the increased cost of mining in Mexico due to its new tariff 
CT  Guatemala s mining industry is relatively immature in comparison with Mexico s  Mexico is  by far  the better jurisdiction  It has a longer history of mining and produces many more silver ounces than Guatemala  Guatemala is a more challenging place to operate from a geopolitical and a community perspective  It is much poorer than Mexico  with a nominal per capita GDP of only 31  of its northern neighbor  And when you have one of the largest and most profitable silver mines in the world being developed in such a poor country  it can be a contentious issue 
TGR  How has Mexico s 7 5  flat tax on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  affected mining companies  CT  It has been largely factored into market prices for the Mexico focused precious metal producers  Mexico remains a very important jurisdiction for world silver production  It offers a trained labor force and  as far as infrastructure is concerned  remains the preferred destination for developing silver exploration opportunities  These realities far outweigh the negative effect the flat tax has had on Mexico s ranking as a mining jurisdiction 
TGR  No one likes paying more to the government  but mining companies are looking for stability  Do they continue to see Mexico as a stable mining regime  CT  Nationally  Mexico remains a stable mining regime  but understand that Mexico is a large  federal jurisdiction with many states that differ in how accepting they are of mining 
TGR  Could you comment on other silver companies with operations in Mexico 
TGR  Pan American Silver Corp   NASDAQ PAAS  has performed very well in the marketplace over the last year  This is one company that has adapted well to a lower silver price environment  It is well managed  and I expect it to continue to pay an attractive dividend  It has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector  At current metal prices  I consider it fairly valued in the market today 
SilverCrest Mines Inc   AMEX SVLC  is a very interesting story  It is in the process of redeveloping its key asset  the Santa Elena mine  from a heap leach deposit to an underground milling operation  I understand that commissioning is proceeding on plan and on budget   Editor s Note  SilverCrest announced on Aug  11 that it completed the mill commissioning   My feeling is that Santa Elena at depth offers significant production growth potential  The key will be whether the company can maintain a low cost profile while remaining cognizant of the higher costs associated with underground production 
TGR  How does the grade compare underground CT  The grade is higher than the heap leach  The benefit  though  will be the mill  whose operation will engender higher recoveries 
TGR  Were there any other companies you want to mention CT  Our preferred micro cap story in the silver space is Santacruz Silver Mining Ltd   TO SCZ   It is ramping up production from its Rosario mine in Mexico a little slower than anticipated but pretty much on track with our outlook for the operation  A key component of Santacruz s valuation will be its development stage project  San Felipe  We await a preliminary economic assessment of this  which will better define how much of an opportunity it is  Santacruz is definitely a company to watch 
TGR  Having been hurt so much in the recent past  many investors await evidence that the tide has turned before they return to mining stocks  Do you think the worst is behind us 
CT  I don t think the mining sector is in a bull market at the moment  What is working in this sector s favor now is reduced volatility  not only with metals prices but also equity prices  If these trends continue  we can expect to see companies like the Fortunas and Tahoes of the world make tremendous strides in adding value at current prices  Such companies will find traction in the marketplace  and their shareholders will be rewarded 
Our outlook doesn t in any way suggest that the whole market will move in unison  but provided that metal prices stay stable  we do expect that well managed companies meeting expectations and delivering real cash flows will shine brightly

However  when the topic is confined to silver  while the speakers tend to be  evangelical   the audiences appear to be  operative word being  appear   simply stark raving madmen of the first order  They usually dress in military fatigues  the males are all in ponytails  the women weigh more than the men  and the T shirts and baseball caps on both males and females carry logos from either the WWF or the Monster Truck conventions  However  they are usually quite erudite when discussing  survival techniques   they are usually extremely well educated and they are all able to rhyme off the silver production numbers for the past 20 years BY COUNTRY  and most importantly  they carry high distain for anyone who fails to know these facts 
These are simply goldbugs amped up on argentine steroids  and I happen to have an extremely high regard for them  as they represent the fringe of the movement  The silver bugs would charge the Federal Reserve Building in a New York minute  they would canonize WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange if allowed  they would vote for Ron Paul 40 years after his passing  and they wear Edward Snowdon T shirts around the local shopping mart  They can usually recite the Declaration of Independence in its entirety and consider themselves true patriots  They view silver as the only  real money  on the planet and normally hold over half of their net worth outside of the banking system in the form of silver  while residing in remote parts of Idaho or Wyoming  usually in the mountains  When I have given speeches or lectures over the years  I can usually pick them out in a crowd  they rarely smile and NEVER laugh at anything I have said  which may or may not be seen as abnormal   Now  you will of course forgive the stereotyping  but that is simply and purely my blanket view of silver bugs 
Irrespective of whether the silver aficionados laugh or not  and they don t   they are certainly SMILING lately  as am I  as there is something immensely gratifying about a prediction that turns out to be both correct and timely  usually it is difficult to pick the right direction  let alone the right timing   Thankfully  my decision to buy silver immediately rather than wait for the inevitable correction in the HUI  NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index  has worked well as it has moved from  15 20 on March 31 to today s high of  17 11  a gain of 12 5  in just under three weeks  It surely did not hurt that Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  was forced to settle a massive price rigging conspiracy and implicate Scotiabank and HSBC in the process  but silver looked like it was going to  pop  long before the massive silver fraud was revealed   See chart above  
As we discussed back in late March  shorting the GTSR  Gold to Silver Ratio  at 80 looked like it could turn out to be the 2016 Trade of the Year  but little did I expect that the move would occur without a breakout  or breakdown  move in gold  As it stands  gold is still locked in that  1 210  1 287 range that has shackled it since the 1st of April  but silver by contrast has been a standout performer since that day  The new recovery high seen today in silver is a big positive over the near term and bodes well for the ultimate test of  18 50  with a strong likelihood that silver is leading gold to what will be an upside resolution to this sideways correction 

The GTSR was originally recommended north of 80
To coin a phrase   There s no fever like GOLD fever   but even better is  There s no mania like silver mania   and now that silver appears to have finally shed the bullion bank shackles  it could easily see the low  20s within a few months  I was thinking of buying a fistful of long dated calls on Pan American Silver Corp  NASDAQ PAAS   but I decided to buy only a few while instead putting more of the cash into a private junior silver company called Santa Rosa Silver Mining Corp   at   05 per share   In that time frame  Pan American Silver had advanced from  10 82 to  14 00 with the July  10 calls advancing from  1 65 to  4 00  so as much as I fashion myself as a metals expert  I should have opened up the wallet and bought the Pan American calls as well  Leaving better than a double on the table hurts despite the fact that the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners  NYSE GDXJ  position has better than doubled since Jan  19 

The GDXJ has been on one wicked tear since mid January and  while we all know how ridiculously undervalued the miners became in the latter half of 2015 and early 2016  RSI  Relative Strength Index  readings above 70 have always been associated with tops in any and all markets that I have followed  Accordingly  I should be taking profits in the GDXJ  but I have decided to refrain and ride the trend instead  It may be madness and it may be greed  but I simply MUST hang on for dear life and pray that the golden bull doesn t throw me into the ditch and my net worth with it 
With silver up another 1 17  this morning  I feel like Robert Duval in  Apocalypse Now  because  I just LOVE the smell of incinerated silver shorts in the morning       As I wrote about back in December with gold starting to rally  it feels different these days and silver feels as though it will be in the  20s sooner than one might imagine

158151,379667,PAAS,Will Silver Prices Breakout In 2013  ,opinion,In an impromptu poll at The Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada Convention  PDAC  in 2012  attendees were decidedly positive as they cited increased demand for silver from sources such as electronics  solar panels and medical uses  in addition to use as an investment vehicle  One year later  Jeffrey Christian  managing partner of CPM Group and the author of the investing book  Commodities Rising   predicts a 2 8  increase in silver demand on the fabrication front after a 1 2  rise in 2012 when solar panel use of silver actually fell about 25    Economic conditions actually may be a bit stronger in the U S   China and a few other major markets this year than they were last year and solar panel use may stabilize   he said   The lower silver prices we anticipate would help boost demand   The key sector to watch  he says  is jewelry and silverware  as that is the most price sensitive demand sector and uses more silver than any other segment of the market   On the investment side  continued political squabbling can have an impact on overall stock prices  but Christian posits that the market is getting tired of politicians playing games and becoming inured to the cacophony   David Morgan  editor of Silver Investor com  explained that investment demand is counterintuitive  The higher the price  the higher the demand   I am optimistic the price will increase  but it will not be a huge increase  There will be some spikes due to derivative plays  quick buck artists driving the price up randomly as they did in April 2011  Central banks have one tool  to debase currency  We all know that    On the supply side of the equation  silver production is less sensitive to the price of silver than many other metals because it is largely a byproduct  Bob Archer  CEO of Great Panther Silver Ltd   GPR TSX  GPL NYSE MKT   which generates almost 70  of its revenue from silver and some 20  from gold production  pointed out that as much as 77  of silver produced globally each year comes as a result of mining for other metals  Depending on whether it is coming with gold  copper or zinc  the silver credit can be an afterthought in the decision to go ahead with production   Often the silver credit is not important  It is more a function of what the primary metal will be   he says   Ross Beaty  chairman of Pan American Silver Corp   PAA TSX  PAAS NASDAQ   counters that the same inflationary pressures impacting silver also effect other metals  thereby limiting new silver production from both sources  He uses the example of the 35 Moz Pascua Lama Gold and Silver Mine Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  decided to build six years ago on the border of Chile and Argentina at an estimated cost of  4 billion   4B  over three years   It could be one of the biggest silver mines in the world  but the mine is nowhere near completion and could be  10B by the time it is done    One of the world s biggest Silver Investors  Eric Sprott  pointed to the availability ratio between Silver and Gold for why the metal price could jump from  30 ounce   30 oz  to as high as  200 oz as he predicted in a recent radio interview   He quotes statistics that show once the industrial use of silver and gold is subtracted from the production and recycling new supply calculations  three times more silver is available for purchase each year than gold  However sales of gold and silver at the US Mint  through exchange traded funds  ETFs  and Sprott s own Physical Trust  show that investors are buying many multiples more silver than gold and have been for years   When predicting the silver price  CPM Group s Christian was conservative   A year ago we said the silver market had peaked in April 2011 and was headed lower  Our view was that silver would average  29 90 oz in 2012  down 11 7  from  35 29 oz in 2011  The price averaged  31 17 oz in 2012  We thought it would not trade above  36 oz during 2012  It settled above  36 oz on only one day  Feb  28  For 2013  we projected an average price of  26 75 oz  We think the price may not rise above  33 oz this year  or  35 oz at the most    SilverStrategies com s Rakhimov believes silver is in the second half of the bull market and expects increased volatility and acceleration of the trend   I expect higher prices substantially higher prices toward the end of 2013 and into 2014  not unlike the trend we saw in 2010 2011   He predicts the bond market will be the catalyst propelling silver upward  as bonds are increasingly struggling to provide safety and investors look for other safe havens   I expect new highs in both silver and gold in the next couple of years and that may prove to be a conservative outlook   Rakhimov explains   How much per ounce does silver have to be in order to make most of the new projects out there economic  We asked those closest to the ground  Beaty  whose Pan American Silver produced 25 1 Moz last year  says that while most companies can make money at  30 oz  rising costs are hitting bottom lines across the industry   Whether open pit or underground mine  from exploration to production the price is multiples higher than it was a decade or even five years ago   Add to rising energy and labor costs  specific country challenges  social  political and environmental realities and unique geological conditions and the capital pressure is immense  Ever the optimist  however  Beaty points out that the challenges facing companies to build and operate mines should lead to constrained supply and increased prices   The where silver companies will be located question probably won t change either  Two Latin American countries Mexico and Peru account for one third of the world silver production and the experts don t see a shift happening anytime soon  Wherever in the world they invest  CPM Group s Christian warns investors to  buy and hold silver intelligently  which may include hedging existing positions and buying when prices fall instead of when they are rising   Even equity investors can hedge by putting puts on commodities to take some of the risk out of the portfolio  That is what he did for clients during the fiscal cliff when he saw the false euphoria and intuited that prices would fall once people realized that it was a manufactured problem and others loomed    We believe investors should hold silver as part of their portfolios   Christian says   The period of sharp capital appreciation in silver prices may be behind the market  at least for the next few years  Even so  owning some silver makes sense as a portfolio diversification move  as a capital preservation tool  and as a safe haven  ,2013-03-18,Commodity Trade

158154,379670,PAAS,How To Stress Test Gold Equities,opinion,Gold prices are down in the short term  but the commodity metal is here to stay  says geologist Joe Mazumdar  In this interview with The Gold Report  the Canaccord Genuity analyst assesses the current situation and compares the performance potential of the majors with the mid caps  He backs up his analysis and predictions with a few solid companies that are positioned to weather the storm   The Gold Report  Where can long term gold investors look for safety during times of market turbulence   Joe Mazumdar  Is there safety in the gold market  The short answer is no  Both the equity and gold market have been volatile  lately more the latter  Gold stocks have a good correlation  a beta  to gold  and if the price of gold is volatile  the stocks will be volatile  This leverage to the gold price cuts both ways for gold equities  Year to date  gold is down 10 15  as it has underperformed most commodities including copper  oil and natural gas  while the S P TSX Global Gold index is down almost 30 35    Other reasons why the gold equities have disappointed investors includes the failure to achieve benchmarks or guidance on costs  both operating and capital  and timelines  among others  The overriding financing risk  especially for the juniors  has continued to weigh on their performance   Major gold producers provide liquidity  but are not necessarily a safe bet  Over the last few years  the large gold companies have not shown growth at a reasonable price  The amount of reserve repletion they require is their Achilles heel such that they have focused on dividends  This is nothing new  as the project requirements tend to create significant footprints and attract the attention of other stakeholders who want to slow down or cancel mining development  This issue is affecting Newmont Mining Corp  s  NEM  Conga project  Pascua Lama with Barrick Gold Corp   ABX  and El Morro with Goldcorp Inc   GG  and New Gold Inc   NGD   If a major s growth is linked to this type of project  it is not necessarily a safe place to invest   Investors should seek out companies that have strong working capital positions relative to their near  to medium term business plan needs  while taking into account their leverage to gold price  The chosen firms should be able to generate decent margins at current spot levels  We would be wary of companies that are in the midst of a material capital cycle  especially if a significant proportion of the funding was expected to be sourced from organic cash flow  Gold has bounced back well over  1 400 ounce   1 400 oz   but the stocks can be stress tested to  1 200 oz  We should anticipate more hedging requirements linked to debt financing facilities   For intermediate producers  look for decent margins at spot levels and stress test down to  1 200 oz  But be wary of any upcoming capital cycle that the firm is looking to execute in the near to medium term  If a company is trying to manage a 10  compound annual growth rate of production  how much new capital does it need and over what period  What is the cash flow  Will it need to return to the debt markets  Look for well funded developers that do not need to return to the equity markets over the near term   Seek management teams that have proven capacity to take the project into production  The amount of multiple mergers and acquisition  M A  bids for targeted companies is few  While some decent premiums can be had  they tend to be off of 52 week lows  For M A potential  I look for a team that can accrue value to the project by derisking it a team that has previously permitted  developed and produced comparable projects in similar jurisdictions   For explorers  look for companies with working capital positions that can fund at least a two year business plan  can move the project forward and are not just burning general and administrative expenses  Executives and senior managers must be vested in the success of the project   TGR  Let s talk about the comparative advantages and disadvantages of sinking capital into underground versus open pit and heap leach operations   JM  Underground projects create a smaller footprint  which is advantageous for permitting  The upfront capital expenditure can be lower as these projects have lower throughputs  so the plant costs are lower  But capital costs for sustaining development underground are higher than for open pit  Underground mining conditions can be problematic  especially with narrow vein mining  Underground miners are harder to find and take longer to train than open pit miners   Because open pit mining creates a larger footprint  the exposure to permitting risk may be elevated  All things being equal  open pit operations tend to treat a higher volume of lower grade material  which depending on the process flow sheet would be more exposed to power costs such that proximity to infrastructure is vital  For a heap leach project  power is less problematic  but heap leach projects range from run of mine to three stage crush  So depending on a mine s exposure to an advanced circuit  power can still be an issue   TGR  How do base metals fit into the equation when assessing potential returns on a gold mining property   JM  Base metals such as copper provide a diversification of revenue and potential for by product credits  as does silver  allowing a gold producer to lower its reported cash costs  Some large low grade deposits that some majors have targeted tend to be porphyry related and deposit type  which provides copper mineralization  The size of these deposits is what attracts the majors  however  the grade  less than 1 g t gold  exposes these projects to capital escalation due to scale and potential for scope changes over a protracted development timeline  Also  the footprint of these deposits  as mentioned previously  can be problematic for permitting and gaining a social license to operate  Geologically  there are also high grade deposits such as volcanic hosted massive sulphide deposits that carry significant base metal credits as well  such as Nevsun Resources Ltd  s  NSU TSX  NSU NYSE MKT  Bisha deposit in Eritrea   The significant base metal component of some of these deposit types requires the sale of a concentrate to a smelter refinery rather than a final saleable product such as gold  This creates an issue for some gold companies  though  because they re generating a fungible product such as gold dore  which does not require as much marketing expertise as selling a concentrate   TGR  What do you mean by marketing   JM  Gold is sold close to a final product with minor additional refining required  but a base metal concentrate containing gold needs to be sold to an intermediary such as a smelter  The seller is not only exposed to base metal and gold prices  but also to treatment and refining charges  TCRCs  of the intermediary  The TCRCs are cyclical  and they impact the revenue stream  The positive aspect of producing base metals is the benefit of a diversified revenue stream  which is good for maintaining a stable cash flow  In the past  investors paid premiums for gold dominant   70   revenue streams  Given the erosion of the highly sought gold premium of late  it is now less problematic for a gold company to generate non gold revenue   TGR  Let s talk about the importance of cash flow   JM  Previously there was an emphasis on operating cash flow and not on free cash flow  The delta between the two line items resides in the inclusion of investing activity such as development and sustaining capital expenditures  Free cash flow is a better indication of a project s profitability  But note if a company has issued a significant portion of debt to fund the project  it may have significant principal payments that can eat up the free cash and challenge its working capital position   TGR  How does Mexico stack up in the global gold matrix    JM  The Institutional Revolutionary Party  PRI  government had been in power in Mexico for a long time  The Partido Acci n Nacional  PAN  held political power over the past decade  and now PRI is back  The government is very pro resource development  In an important change  royalty legislation is slowly moving through Mexico s Congress  The royalty looks as if it will not be a net smelter return  which would impact the revenue line directly  but a 5  net profits interest  NPI   which takes operating costs into account  Given that Mexico does not currently have a mining royalty structure  an NPI is not necessarily a bad thing  Mexico remains one of the largest gold and silver producers in the world  I think security remains an issue in some states such that we would anticipate higher general and administrative costs for some projects to include funding to mitigate security risks   We cover a company operating in Mexico called Esperanza Resources Corp   EPZ TSX V   We have a  1 70 target on it  Esperanza has been trading around  0 86 share  It has a market cap of  70 million   70M  and a management team with experience in Mexico  Members of Esperanza s management team previously were senior executives and managers with Minefinders Corp   MFL TSX  MFN NYSE   which was sold to Pan American Silver Corp   PAA TSX  PAAS NASDAQ  in early 2012  The management team has a history of permitting  developing and producing open pit  heap leach projects in Mexico  Given the current market conditions  we don t believe an investor can afford to have people learning on the job right now  Esperanza s key themes are management with a near term  funded and permitted project in its La Bolsa project in northern Mexico and its flagship project  Esperanza  in the permitting process  The next important catalyst is the closing of Esperanza s transaction with Pan American Silver Corp   TGR  How do you feel about adding names in Argentina to your coverage list   JM  Goldrock Mines Corp  s  GRM TSX V  senior management team has a history of developing companies and vending them  Paul Matysek  Goldrock s president and CEO  has developed three companies with three different underlying commodities lithium  potash and uranium in three different jurisdictions  We ve seen M A in Argentina Yamana Gold Inc   AUY  purchased Cerro Moro from Extorre Gold Mines Ltd   XG  in mid 2012  The portion of the Joaquin project joint venture owned by Mirasol Resources Ltd   MRZ TSX V  was purchased by Coeur d Alene Mines Corp   CDE  in late 2012   People who are familiar with operating in Argentina are comfortable with purchasing assets at a discount  M A in Argentina offers a lot of upside potential in the face of an inflating cost environment and issues with import restrictions combined with attempts to curb the outflow of capital by the government  The key themes are management with its permitted Lindero project in northwest Argentina  with the next significant catalyst being guidance on financing its development   TGR  What about the possibility of those assets being nationalized    JM  In early 2012  Argentina did expropriate YPF from Spain s Repsol S A   citing a lack of investment in the development of some assets  In late 2012  Chevron Corp   CVX  became the first major oil company to negotiate a deal with YPF since nationalization  Also in early 2013  Argentina ended its Oil Plus program to encourage investment in the industry  The last two events suggest that the Argentine government has gained a greater understanding into the mindset of foreign investors that possess the critical skill sets to help it develop its resource sector   Argentina does not have a significant mining history like Chile when the latter nationalized its copper industry  The lack of mining history translates to a lack of technical people that would allow the local government to develop and operate these projects  Argentina still needs foreign capital and technical skills to build its mining industry  Also  Argentina needs to generate export revenue to maintain and grow its current account balance  Producing and exporting mined metals would help some of its near term issues   Although I doubt that a company without a current interest in Argentina will acquire an asset given the geopolitical risk  a firm already generating cash flow within the country would see some Argentina assets as opportunistic given the discounted valuations  An M A bid is not implausible for a company like Goldrock  Argentina is a Top 20 gold producer  Goldrock CEO Matysek recently sold a lithium project in Argentina  so that bodes well  and COO David Keough has a history operating in Argentina with Minera Alumbrera  and he s in country   TGR  What about North American small and mid range names   JM  We recently initiated on a development company called Midway Gold Corp   MDW   Liquidity wise  it trades logarithmically a lot more on the U S  market that it does on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada  Midway has a Nevada based portfolio of open pit  heap leach projects  Its near term Pan project is a 70 000 80 000 ounce  70 80 Koz  potential producer and requires about  100 110M of capital expenditures  It closed a preferred share facility of  70M with a New York hedge fund in late 2012  so it  similar to Esperanza  has been able to raise money in these difficult times  The key themes are the experienced management team with a near term  partially funded project pipeline currently in the permitting process  The next important catalyst is a record of decision enabling the company to break ground at Pan and guidance on sourcing funding for the remainder the project capital   TGR  Is Nevada particularly hot right now   JM  It s been hot for the last two to three years  As investors get more concerned about geopolitical risk  they tend to revert to familiar jurisdictions  The big operators in Nevada tend to be more focused on their own operations and their brownfield projects  Saying that  Newmont did buy Fronteer Gold Inc   FRG   which had an open pit  heap leach project close to Elko called Long Canyon  Nevada has a significant amount of exploration and development activity  The permitting process in the state is protracted but it is transparent  Investors seeking lower risk geopolitical jurisdictions would rather have a protracted permitting timeline with a transparent permitting process rather than a quick path to production with a future risk of creeping expropriation   TGR  Let s circle back to the theme we started with  which is the beta of gold prices and mining stocks and the S P 500  Should people who have been invested in gold double down on their gold investment or look to stocks to balance portfolios  not just gold stocks but S P 500 standards    JM  Overall  one should always have a balanced portfolio regardless if you are a goldbug or not  If an investor has a certain percentage in alternative investments  and a portion of those alternative investments is in gold  then the investor should consider investments with a high beta to gold  Opportunities exist for large cap and intermediate producers as well as for junior companies at the explorer and development stages   An investor s knowledge of the gold sector should determine the depth to which he or she plunges  Those who do not know a lot about the sector should stick to large cap  liquid stocks for which there is a lot of analysis  Look for firms that do not have a big capital cycle coming up  with a respectable working capital position that can be stress tested to  1 200 oz gold price and still generate modest returns   If you believe in a positive gold price environment over the near to medium term and have a deeper knowledge of the sector  higher beta development projects may be a consideration  Seek the management teams that have been able to attract financing over the past year and a half that have the technical capacity to derisk the project and accrue value all the way into production  A management team that has experience in the jurisdiction where the project is located is always a positive  The paucity of multiple bid M A is forcing the junior developers to provide the investing community a credible path to generating revenue   Gold is a difficult sector and has been beaten down  But if you re a contrarian  the time when the herd is rushing to the exit is a signal to return to the market  The problem has been picking the bottom  which is always difficult  gold has recovered from its inter day lows of US 1 350 oz on the back of a resurgence of physical demand from India and China   TGR  Thanks  Joe  for your insights   Joe Mazumdar

158156,379672,PAAS,Frank Holmes  Brian Hicks  The Three Ways To Play The Junior Resource ,opinion,The recent volatility in the gold market has investors taking a second look at their strategies  In this interview with The Gold Report  Frank Holmes and Brian Hicks of U S  Global Investors discuss their criteria for investment decisions  the factors they think will affect the gold sector and how ETFs are distorting the gold equities market  The Gold Report  Frank  you are one of the most positive people I know  What happened to gold in mid April  and could it happen again   Frank Holmes  I often remind investors that gold has two drivers  the fear trade and the love trade   The fear trade captures most of the attention  Many people who have put money into the SPDR Gold Trust  GLD NYSE A  and other gold ETFs have bought for the fear trade  The fear trade kicked in due to governments monetizing debt at an excessive rate  creating negative real interest rates  For example  last year Japan  Europe and the U S  rolled over about  8 trillion from three year paper to five year paper below the inflationary rate  Historically  this is very important for gold   The other half of the equation is the love trade  which is gold bought for cultural reasons  such as gift giving for holidays  weddings and birthdays  Given that China and India account for 40  of the world s population  the rising per capita gross domestic product  GDP  in emerging economies is important for the love trade  Even a modest slowdown on per capita GDP in those countries has a significant impact on the demand side of the equation   In the last year  India s government tried to slow down the amount of gold being imported  In January 2013  India imposed a 6  tax  which slowed love trade demand in the short term  And the per capita GDP of China and India slowed down modestly   Still  the love trade remained strong over the entire year  According to official statistics from the World Gold Council  as of the end of the first quarter of 2013  the year over year change in consumer gold demand for jewelry  bars and coins rose 27  in India  In China  gold demand grew 20    TGR  If the love trade demand changed over the last year  why did we have that sudden  one day fall in the price   FH  I do not know  I try not to get caught up in all the conspiracy thinking out there  but rather appreciate cycles  where historically gold has climbed after Chinese New Year and had little rallies all the way until summer  Typically  in June  gold investors see a bottom  In late July and early August  35 years of data show that the love trade demand picks up and runs until February   TGR  What could happen between now and July when love demand historically picks up   FH  We will have to see when the Indian and Chinese economies start to pick up  That will be important for the love trade   But the love trade is not going away  Even in North America  when gold dropped  we saw gold going from paper hands in the exchange traded funds  ETFs  to strong hands  Gold analysts in Toronto told me about lines of people 30 yards long waiting to buy gold  Everything smaller than 5 ounces was sold out   TGR  In a May 11 article  you list three reasons to buy gold equities today  Can you tell me what you look for in a gold company today   FH  We like a board of directors that is consumed with the return on capital model  One of the best ways to get a return on capital is to grow revenue  to have a profit margin for capital costs and to pay dividends  The final ingredient is to buy back your shares  With the S P 500 making all time highs  one can see the high correlation of companies buying back their stock and increasing their dividends  That is what has propelled the stock market to where it is   Alamos Gold Inc   AGI TSX  is one recent gold company to have done that   Many other gold mining companies  which people tend to think of as large market cap companies  have been value destroyers  Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE  has a market cap below  20 billion   20B   It has spent  17B trying to increase its production  which has decreased from 8 million ounces  8 Moz  to almost 5 Moz year  It would have been better off using  7B to sustain its cash flow from operations and spending  10B to buy back stock and increase dividends  Had it done that  it would have a much higher valuation  Now  all of a sudden  companies like Newmont say they will increase their dividends and share some of that return from the higher price of gold   The other companies in a bad situation are those that issue stock options faster than they increase their reserves or their production  That dilutes shareholder interest  They make acquisitions that dilute on a reserve per share or production per share basis   Investors want to look at companies that have the discipline to increase their dividends and have leadership like Alamos Gold s that will increase dividends and buy back stock for the free cash flow   TGR  Is paying a dividend an important part   FH  Absolutely  Over the past 50 years  almost half of the total returns of the S P 500 alone have been reinvested dividends   Too many companies were hungry for cash to expand just for the sake of expanding  They destroyed capital rather than focus on margin  I think the gold industry is waking up to this situation   Some of the silver stocks are showing increased capacity for dividends  more free cash flow and low cash flow multiples  One of my favorites is Franco Nevada Corp   FNV   It pays a monthly dividend  higher than what you can make on a five year government note  It has high profit margins  and management is very disciplined about its return on capital model   TGR  What about the explorers  Are there certain types of explorers or jurisdictions that you like   FH  Three things will hurt the junior resource cycle for another couple of years  Number one  the laws of Mother Nature dictate that the odds are against junior mining companies in making a discovery  Number two  a lot of the geologists who are out there exploring have no relationship with money managers  sellside brokers or capital markets  Number three  you have layer after layer of governmental regulations that are not always well thought out   The jockeys are very important in the explorer space  You have to have someone who puts money up  who has a successful track record  We really have to know the jockeys and their expertise  following and track record   TGR  Brian  who are some of the jockeys you like to follow who fit those criteria   Brian Hicks  Lukas Lundin  chairman of Lundin Mining Corp   LUN TSX   writes his own checks and puts up his own risk capital  We have had some success with him  Ross Beaty  chairman of Pan American Silver Corp   PAAS   is another  he also has skin in the game   TGR  Your World Precious Metals Fund includes just over 79  gold and silver and 11  cash  It is down about 37  for the year  How are you adjusting your portfolio in this volatile environment   FH  I think it s important to outperform the ETFs that are out there competing for capital  Cash is one component of how we are adjusting to the volatility  Last year we looked at all the juniors we own  we scrutinized every quarterly financial statement to see how much cash each company had and the burn rate  If a company had no discovery or was early  we sold them  That helped us in the junior space   BH  We continue to have a broad stable of 25 or so junior resource names  but we high graded the portfolio by eliminating the names that would be unlikely to get financing  We elected to take those stranded names out of the portfolio   The space has seen so much carnage that it is difficult even now to say what was a junior and what was a small or mid cap   FH  To add to what Brian is saying  we took a hard look at all producers that were producing less than 1 gram per ton  1 g t    TGR  How many were in that category   FH  Not too many  since grade is king in any gold price environment   TGR  Your Gold and Precious Metals Fund is about 41  mid cap  which you define as  1 10B  and 48  small cap  which you define as under  1B  The World Precious Metals Fund is 79  small cap  Do those small caps expose the fund to more upside   FH  Yes  they expose it to more volatility  The World Precious Minerals Fund will look at greenfield and brownfield companies  therefore  that fund has more volatility   TGR  If it gives you exposure to the upside  how do you protect from the downside   FH  We do what we have described  We shrunk the number of names with greater risk  many of them have fallen some as much as 90  from a year ago  When looking at producers  we look for a higher grade   Acquisitions are another phenomenon for gold mining companies in the capital markets  As soon as someone acquires another company  we tend to sell it  The stock is usually dead money for 18 months while the acquiring company digests the acquisition   TGR  But you still get the upside from the bump up in the share price when it is bought  correct   FH  Yes  and that has helped the portfolios  as we have had several companies that were purchased   TGR  B2Gold Corp   BTG  dropped to  2 share  Is that because of its acquisitions in the last quarter or is that part of the industry trend   FH  B2Gold has been a great mid cap  higher grade company that performs well  Its drop is the mutation that is caused by ETFs  Money has flowed into the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF  GDXJ  and whenever a stock is one of the Top 10 positions  it gets tossed out because its market cap then exceeds  3B  It has nothing to do with the quality of the company  it is all about access   B2Gold rebalanced when the company it acquired was also on the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF and its market cap got too big  It ended up orphaned because it lacked a U S  listing and could not qualify for the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  GDX    The same thing happened with SEMAFO Inc   SMF TSX  and Romarco Minerals Inc   R TSX   Romarco exploded on the upside in 2010  The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners had  400 million come in within three days   TGR  Do you still like B2Gold s fundamentals   FH  We sold a lot of B2Gold going into the merger and then reloaded  The risk was that by March it would have to be pushed out of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners and would have to rush to get a U S  listing   As a fund manager  we have to factor in the change in holdings of these big ETFs because money flows  not gold companies  discoveries or fundamentals  are dictating the price volatility of many small cap stocks   TGR  Are you nervous about the redemptions some large funds are experiencing  What is your strategy to calm down nervous investors   FH  We advocate keeping a 5  or 10  weighting in gold and rebalancing  When gold moves  it moves explosively  and you end up buying at the top  Conversely  gold today is extremely oversold on all mathematical models  The value being offered by many of these companies is so much more attractive and compelling to investors   If interest rates were to climb 2  above the inflation rate  it would totally distort the gold crisis  If short term interest rates in the U S  were to reach 4   the boom in the housing market would end  That would affect job creation  But we do not see that happening   TGR  What about the impact on bonds  In a recent interview with James Dines  he said bonds will blow out as soon as interest rates start to go up   FH  They will  no doubt  Governments are always trying to manage their currency using relative purchasing power parity  They are using low interest rates to stimulate economic activity  We believe that will continue   BH  I would echo that  We still have a large output gap and high unemployment   There is a lot of complacency in the equity markets  That has taken some money growth out of gold  but as Frank has said in the past  gold is insurance  At some point  money will flow back into gold because of the tenuous and difficult state of the global economy  Gold is a good portfolio diversifier   FH  Gold is volatile because it is the inverse of currency moves  The fundamentals that would change things are 1  a dramatic fall in the per capita GDP of most of the emerging market countries and 2  a rise in interest rates 2  above the Consumer Price Index  We just do not think that will happen for a while   The other long term implication is the delay in new mines coming onstream  Every time a government moves the goal posts for taxing these companies  capital will be squeezed  Neither banks nor the equity markets will put up the money  The result will be a drop in supply for many commodities   TGR  Particularly platinum and palladium  or gold and silver as well   FH  Gold and silver  too  as projects get delayed   TGR  Frank and Brian  thanks for your time and

158169,379685,PAAS,A Closer Look At Plains All American Pipeline s Distributable Cash Flow ,opinion,On November 6  2012  Plains All American Pipeline L P   PAA  reported results of operations for 3Q 2012  Revenues  operating income  net income and earnings before interest  depreciation   amortization and income tax expenses  EBITDA  for 3Q 2012 and for the trailing 12 months   TTM   are summarized in Table 1  PAA provided updated financial and operating guidance for 2012  increasing adjusted EBITDA guidance by  137 million to slightly over  2 billion   7  increase vs  the guidance provided on 8 6 12 and  22  over the full year guidance provided at the beginning of the year  This implies a projection of  520 million of adjusted EBITDA for 4Q12  PAA also provided preliminary adjusted EBITDA guidance of  1 925 million  mid point  for 2013 on the assumption that favorable market conditions will not continue beyond 1Q13  Hence it is lower than the TTM number  Strong performance was exhibited by all segments  particularly Supply   Logistics  as seen in Table 2   In 3Q12 PAA wrote down a substantial portion of its investment in the Pier 400 project  The write down  amounting to   125 million  is reflected in Table 2 as an increase to depreciation   amortization  hence the large increase in this line item in 3Q12 and TTM ending 9 30 12 vs  the prior year periods  The Pier 400 terminal project involved development of a deepwater petroleum import terminal at Pier 400 and Terminal Island in the Port of Los Angeles for the purpose of handling marine receipts of crude oil and refinery feedstock  During 3Q12 PAA decided not to proceed with this project  hence the write down of its investment in it  In 2011 the Supply   Logistics segment generated extraordinary profits   647 million vs   240 million in 2010   In a  I noted the drivers behind this growth  Management cautioned that the margins delivered in 2011 may not be repeated  Results for 1Q 2012 indicated a 3 8  decline in that segment s contribution compared to the prior year period  However  in 2Q12 Supply   Logistics s profit contribution jumped 81  over the prior year period  In 3Q12 we see a 21  decline  Unlike the Facilities and Transportation segments which are predominantly fee based businesses  Supply   Logistics is margin based and hence its results are more volatile  Given quarterly fluctuations in revenues  working capital needs and other items  it makes sense to review TTM numbers rather than quarterly numbers for the purpose of analyzing changes in reported and sustainable distributable cash flows  In an article titled  I present the definition of DCF used by Plains All American Pipeline L P   PAA  and provide a comparison to definitions used by other master limited partnerships  Using PAA s definition  DCF for the TTM ending 9 30 12 was  1 434 million   4 48 per unit   up from  1 039 million   3 56 per unit  in the corresponding prior year period  As always  I first attempt to assess how these figures compare with what I call sustainable DCF for these periods and whether distributions were funded by additional debt or issuing additional units  The generic reasons why DCF as reported by the MLP may differ from sustainable DCF are reviewed in an article titled   Applying the method described there to PAA results through 9 30 12 generates the comparison outlined in Table 3 below  The principal differences between reported DCF and sustainable DCF relate working capital  risk management activities and a variety of items grouped under  Other   Under PAA s definition  reported DCF always excludes working capital changes  whether positive or negative  My definition of sustainable DCF only excludes working capital generated  I deduct working capital consumed   Despite appearing to be inconsistent  this makes sense because in order to meet my definition of sustainability the MLP should generate enough capital to cover normal working capital needs  On the other hand  cash generated by the MLP through the liquidation or reduction of working capital is not a sustainable source and I therefore ignore it  Over reasonably lengthy measurement periods  working capital generated tends to be offset by needs to invest in working capital  In the TTM ending 9 30 12 working capital consumed cash amounting to  236 million  Management adds back this amount in deriving reported DCF while I do not  Risk management activities aggregate numerous positive and negative adjustments  For example  the  121 million downward adjustment in inventory valuation in 2Q12 was oddest by gains related to derivatives  I generally do not consider cash generated by risk management activities to be sustainable  although I recognize that one could reasonable argue that bona fide hedging of commodity price risks should be included  The PAA risk management activities seem to be directly related to such hedging  so I could be persuaded to also show what sustainable DCF would be if it included cash generated by risk management activities  But I do not do so since the amounts are relatively small in the periods being reviewed  PAA also provided preliminary DCF guidance of  1 352 million  mid point  for 2013 on the assumption that favorable market conditions will not continue beyond 1Q13  Hence it is lower than the TTM number  Coverage ratios appear strong  as indicated in Table 4 below  The high coverage ratios mean that PAA retains   400 to  500 million of excess cash flow as a source of capital and thereby reduces reliance on debt or issuance of additional units that dilute existing holders  The general partner gets 50  of any distributions in excess of  1 35 per unit per annum  Given the current distribution rate is  2 17 per unit per annum  this is a significant burden that pushes up PAA s cost of capital  The excess cash flow is therefore has a very low cost of capital compared to the cost of issuing additional units  I find it helpful to look at a simplified cash flow statement by netting certain items  e g   acquisitions against dispositions  and by separating cash generation from cash consumption  Here is what I see for PAA    Simplified Sources and Uses of Funds  Net cash from operations  less maintenance capital expenditures  less cash related to net income attributable to non controlling partners exceeded distributions by  410 million in the TTM ending 9 30 12 and by  683 million in the TTM ending 9 30 11  Clearly PAA is not using cash raised from issuance of debt and equity to fund distributions   2 7billion of the   3 1 billion spent  net of sale proceeds  on growth capital projects and acquisitions in the TTM ending 9 30 12 was funded by debt and the issuance of additional partnership units  the   400m balance was generated from internal cash flow  PAA s per unit distributions have grown at a compounded rate of  7 5  per annum since 2001  They grew 8 1  in the TTM ending 9 30 12 and are forecasted by management to grow 7 8  in 2013  In the TTM ending 6 30 12  distributions per unit increased by 7   PAA s balance sheet is strong  At September 30  2012  long term debt to capitalization ratio was 46   total debt to capitalization ratio was 49   and long term debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2 9x  Note that  834 million   12 5   of total debt is short term debt that primarily supports hedged inventory  This debt is essentially self liquidating from the cash proceeds when the inventory is sold  PAA s current yield is at the low end of the MLP universe  A comparison to some of the MLPs I follow is provided in Table 6 below   PAA  EPD and MMP are all outstanding MLPs  The relatively low yields notwithstanding  their operational results have been excellent and have driven up unit prices  thus generating significant capital gains for the partners  They are a solid choice for more conservative MLP investors  The only reason I would favor EPD and MMP over PAA is the capital structure   no general partner incentive distributions for EPD and MMP vs  50  in the case of PAA  On the other hand  PAA seems to show greater unit price resiliency in the face of steep declines that have adversely affected MLPs since November 6  From 11 5 2012 to 11 15 2012 EPD fell 7 98  and MMP fell 7 19   while PAA declined 4 07  ,2012-11-18,Ron

158170,379686,PAAS,Leonard Melman  Fiscal Cliff A Boon For Precious Metals ,opinion,Surveying reality from his perch on Vancouver Island  Leonard Melman is a veritable sage in the world of metal mining analysis  In an interview with The Gold Report  the economic philosopher is troubled about the direction of the global economy  However  there are a few bright spots for eagle eyed junior metal investors  he reports  and names some of his favorite picks The Gold Report  Leonard  what are the most pressing issues facing investors today  Leonard Melman  Let s start with the fiscal cliff  If America falls into this abyss  the combination of tax increases and spending reductions will slow down economic growth  Interestingly  political leaders in Europe are calling for increasing taxes and decreasing spending in order to solve their problems  I find it amusing that the solution to economic problems being proposed by leaders on the European side of the Atlantic is thought to be the problem on the American side of the Atlantic  TGR  How do you account for the disconnect  LM  It is due to a philosophical inconsistency and a lack of economic understanding on the part of the world s political leaders  most of whom are not well qualified as economic thinkers  nor as philosophers for that matter  TGR  How important is a philosophical stance to making a cogent economic analysis  LM  Adhering to a strong underlying philosophy can guide leaders through difficult times  Unfortunately  demands by the public for more and more government services are making politicians even more reluctant to come down on the side of austerity  particularly in America  The results are uncontrollable deficits and a massive national debt  The statutory debt limit of the U S  government is  16 394 trillion  The national debt of the U S  as of mid December was  16 337 trillion  Therefore  a mere  52 billion remained before the ever rising debt reaches the statutory limit  TGR  What will happen if no measures are taken to change the debt limit  LM  According to law  portions of the government must cease operations once the limit is reached  Nobody wants to see that happen  least of all politicians  So I believe they will likely agree to increase the debt limit by another couple trillion dollars  TGR  What will happen if the two party system fails to agree on tax and spending cuts  How will the market respond  LM  The market operates in two different directions  The precious metals market historically has regarded instability as a plus  The financial markets have historically regarded instability or uncertainty as a minus  If the parties fail to resolve either the fiscal cliff or the debt limit problem  I believe the financial markets will react negatively  but the precious metals markets will most probably react positively  TGR  Then why has the price of gold bullion during the last year been so out of sync with the deflated price of junior gold mining stocks  LM  In late 2007 and early 2008  the price of gold hovered near  800 ounce  oz   It s over  1 700 oz now more than double the earlier price and yet the three most popular mining share indexes  the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index  XAU   the NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index  HUI  and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  GDX   are all below their late 2007 and early 2008 levels  That is rather astonishing  The reason is that the nature of mining especially for the juniors has undergone dramatic changes in recent years  none of which are positive  Increasing energy  transportation  geological and licensing costs make it now more expensive to mine for metals  but the most pressing problem is that the time that it takes to put a newly discovered mine into operation has increased at a rapid rate  I ve been in this business for four decades  In the late 1970s  a mine could anticipate rapid progress from the time of discovery  A junior simply raised money  put the money into the ground  proved up the asset  got construction financing and went into production  Now a series of lengthy bureaucratic processes are making it difficult for mining companies to raise new funds in the financial markets because that causes share dilution  Share dilution tends to knock down share price  which makes it difficult to arrange the next round of financing  which then makes it even more difficult to advance exploration and development and a most difficult spiral ensues that makes it very difficult for miners to generate revenue from production  TGR  Are environmental regulations the only cause of slowing timelines for new mine development  LM  There are other obstacles  In Canada  we have an aboriginal problem  The courts have literally given many aboriginal tribes the ability to interfere in the progress of a mining venture  Companies are required to  consult  with them at various stages of progress  Consultation is expensive  it s time consuming  and it can be interrupted by legal procedures at almost any time  TGR  Do you see any changes in the near term  LM  The near term remains very difficult  In the long term  I m fairly optimistic  because the world needs metals to survive  plain and simple  You can t cook food  you can t drive anywhere  you can t process energy  you can t run computers  you can t have medical instruments and you can t do almost anything that we do in modern life without metals  When genuine metal shortages begin to develop  we will see pressure build for a revision in these policies  TGR  Are there any North American gold juniors that can weather these difficulties  LM  There are some  I ve developed an interest in Balmoral Resources Ltd   BAR TSX V  BAMLF OTCQX   A while back  I got to know Darin Wagner  and he struck me as a very competent individual  He successfully sold a company called West Timmins Mining Inc   WTM TSX   and now he s the president of Balmoral  He understands the value of obtaining properties with a high likelihood of success  The old adage is that if you want to develop a new mine  acquire property in the vicinity of an old mine  Balmoral is working in the Detour Gold Trend along the Qu bec Ontario border  which has four different multimillion ounce projects  Wagner has a great chance of success there  Another company that I like is DNI Metals Inc   DNI TSX V  DG7 FSE   It is working to develop black shale deposits in northern Alberta fairly close to the shale oil deposits and those black shales contain an enormous variety of metals  DNI has proven up very sizeable ore bodies at two locations on its properties  Buckton and Buckton South  and its current work involves resolving metallurgical problems  It s obviously a high risk investment  The shares are about  0 18 share right now  but there could be a very substantial return if the project works out  TGR  DNI s shares have fallen from a high of about  0 65 a year ago  Why is that  LM  The same thing we ve been talking about  the prolonged period of trying to prove up the resource during which time a firm has to keep raising funds to satisfy all operational and regulatory requirements  And the longer it has to keep looking for new funds  the more shares are outstanding  which tends to dilute the value per share  TGR  So now would be a good time to buy DNI  LM  From a risk reward ratio  I believe it is a good time to acquire the shares being fully cognizant of the risks and  of course  an investor should always do his own due diligence  but I think the potential gains outweigh the potential risks  TGR  What about investing in bullion as opposed to investing in gold stocks  LM  As noted earlier  during the last four years  investing directly in gold bullion would have provided a 112  gain  Investments in a variety of mining shares would have  on balance  stood still  But in the past  the opposite dynamic has applied  Looking forward  if the world monetary situation keeps declining  there could be a truly powerful gold bull market in front of us  That also applies to silver  platinum  palladium and some of the base metals  It is necessary for investors to clearly define their specific goals  If the general motive for investing in gold and silver is safety and preservation of purchasing power in case currencies break down  as they have done before  then one wants physical possession of the metals  But for trading gains  shares can be advantageous  Aside from shares  if a player desires to get in and out of the gold market quickly  exchange traded funds work well  It depends on the investor s objective  TGR  What about silver  LM  I like silver more than gold as a trading vehicle  because when precious metals are rising  silver tends to rise at twice the rate of gold  Of course  when the prices fall  silver falls farther  but if one anticipates a bull market in metals  then silver has real advantages  There are a couple of silver mines that I truly like in Mexico  Orko Silver Corp   OK TSX V  has a very substantial deposit in Durango State of up to 200 million ounces of Indicated and Inferred reserves  Orko developed the property for about eight years before Pan American Silver Corp   PAA TSX  PAAS NASDAQ  bought into the project  It created a joint venture with Pan American  which provided expertise and at least  18 million  M  of capital for exploration  But then Pan American decided that the project did not fit its needs  so it abandoned it  The net result is that Orko obtained  at no cost to itself   18M worth of exploration  which enabled it to publish a resource estimate  and allowed for a substantial increase in holdings  There was a bit of a shock to the share price when Pan American pulled out  but the stock now seems to be moving in an upward trend  The project is huge  Orko can either sell it to a major  or develop it into a very important and productive mine  NOTE  Immediately following this interview  on December 16 First Majestic Silver Corp  issued a Press Release that announced that it had just concluded a friendly takeover of Orko  which afforded Orko shareholders a 69  gain over the present market value of Orko shares  SilverCrest Mines Inc   SVL TSX V  SVLC NYSE MKT  has a property in production in Sonora State  Mexico  called Santa Elena  It is throwing off a substantial amount of cash flow to further develop the Santa Elena resource  plus another property  La Joya  in Durango State  SilverCrest is expanding resources and increasing production  and doing it thanks to the cash from Santa Elena without suffering from the stock dilution that has been so harmful to other companies  It has managed to create a substantial cash reserve of about  20M  TGR  Cash flow may be one of the most important things for investors to keep in mind  LM  Cash flow improves the likelihood of a firm advancing its project by increasing production or discovering new resources without encountering potentially ruinous share dilution  TGR  The share price of many specialty or  rare earth  metal mining corporations has disappointed investors during the past year  What will it take to reverse that trend  LM  The world of rare earth elements is incredibly complex and potholed with variables  There are an enormous number of elements and each has its own attributes and its own uses  It takes full time study to get a grip on how to identify demand  and how that demand can be met  given the network of variables  The rare earth miners definitely need to make a better effort to educate the public about the nature of their business  And there is the same problem  as with all metals  of having to spend money without being on a clear path toward production  Some of the critical metals juniors went up very sharply a few years ago  after the Chinese announced they were suddenly limiting exports  Although the U S  military establishment requires a stream of rare earth elements and other markets for rare earths are growing  many juniors have made little progress toward achieving production  The reputation of several of these companies has been hurt  The industry must more clearly identify to investors the positive attributes of rare earth elements and step up the pace toward production  TGR  Are there any names worth watching in the critical metals space  LM  Commerce Resources Corp   CCE TSX V  D7H FSE  CMRZF OTCQX  is unique in that it has two specific projects with preliminary economic assessments  It has the Blue River tantalum niobium project in British Columbia and a rare earth element project called Eldor in northern Qu bec  Each project appears to be capable of standing on its own merits  the company is attracting interest from potential end users and possible joint venture partners  The price of the shares has come down recently  but I believe it s reached the point where the potential rewards truly outweigh the risks  TGR  Are there any holding companies in the metal mining space that investors should investigate  LM  I enjoy Zimtu Capital Corp   ZC TSX V  in Canada  Its game plan is to fund early stage companies with developable projects  By funding and forming new companies  it is able to offer its own investors a chance to participate in early stage share offerings at an advantageous price before the initial public offering  IPO   When Zimtu funds a project it normally receives a substantial block of shares  If the general market environment goes up  then the asset values of Zimtu go up  and that should lead to increases in its share price  It is a good game plan and if the market environment for the whole junior mining sector improves  then Zimtu stands to profit substantially  TGR  Returning to the start of our conversation  how do your political and ideological preferences affect how you identify opportunities in the markets that you cover  LM  I am a deep believer in limited government  There should be simple and easy to understand regulations only where they re absolutely necessary  The current government interferences are a profound negative and worsening  If we can somehow turn the long standing trend toward excessive regulations around  then profit opportunities within the mining industry should improve dramatically  I m normally an optimist  but I have serious concerns about the world s financial stability going forward  Europe in many places is a basket case  Japan is facing enormous problems  particularly demographic problems  Nobody knows for sure what China is doing  America is facing colossal budgetary problems  There s a mess out there and it s hard to see a really clear path to valid solutions to the litany of ongoing serious problems  It s not that I m a pessimist  I love life  I love nature and hiking in the woods and mountains  but when it comes to discussing economic matters  I do try to be a realist and look reality straight in the face  Frankly  there have been pleasanter times  TGR  Thank you  Leonard  LM  My pleasure  indeed  Peter   publisher of The Melman Report  has been writing about precious and base metals for more than two decades as monthly

158178,379694,PAAS,A Close Look At Plains All American Pipeline,opinion,In a previous series of energy related articles  I discussed how the resurgence of natural gas would give us a solid alternative to oil for transportation energy needs  In addition  natural gas will also provide us with additional supplies of petrochemicals to offset the world s insatiable demand for them and their end products  which includes just about everything you might currently purchase at Walmart  The gas shale boom has come along just in time to offset declining cheap oil supplies and offer the U S   in particular  the enviable position of net energy exporter of the future  Those who have excess energy tend to have stronger and more resilient long term economies  In addition to boosting our prospects of economic stability based upon a solid foundation of domestic energy supplies  the boom in natural gas and oil production in the United States provides investors with many potential choices for stock appreciation and dividend plays  In this series  I will present some companies across the natural gas sector that may profit investors handsomely for several years  I ll begin by discussing a midstream energy company  Plains All American Pipeline  LP  PAA   and will weigh benefit versus risk  FoundationPlains is a vertically integrated oil and gas midstream company providing facilities  supplies and logistics  and transportation  The company sports over  5 billion in portfolio across a range of assets  The company has over 19 000 miles of pipeline in North America as its largest transportation asset  and is beefing up rail transportation to address short term shortages with  1 billion in rail depot projects in the last several months  The segment also includes trucks  trailers  and barges  Facilities provide storage  terminals  and throughput services for oil  natural gas  LPG  and refined products  The segment also offers LPG fractionation and processing of natural gas  Supply and Logistics purchases product and resells it at the other end of their transportation networks  Plains dropped down its natural  as storage into a separate LP  PAA Natural Gas Storage  PNG   which I will discuss in a future article  The recent purchase of BP s Canadian NGL assets provides Plains with an opportunity to process and transport those products in Canadian to U S  markets  as well as using the infrastructure for moving other refined products that capture higher premiums on the market  Plains management expects their retail approach to raise margins on these former assets which BP used primarily for internal purposes  Outside of the BP purchase  Plains has concentrated on expanding pipelines  storage  and rail at existing sites to take advantage of local market knowledge while reducing the risk of asset under utilization  Plains management has positioned assets in active and sizeable oil and gas plays that should allow smooth monetization and provide solid returns for investors  The approach to Plains  expansion is a solid one with real gains seen in each business segment  I believe that Plains business model closely aligns with growth in the oil and gas segments  specifically in pipelines and rail to markets and in fractionation of natural gas liquids  The company has a forward thinking market approach and has appeared to spend their money wisely given current market trends  Business RiskIn keeping with my risk based approach to investing  the following is my analysis of the risks that Plains All American Pipleline faces in the market  First  the recent expenditures in rail appear to alleviate the near term shortage of transportation needs to various markets  However  pipelines have a higher return over time and the industry is expected to invest very heavily in pipelines that will compete in some areas directly with Plains rail expansion  Determining what competition will arise is difficult as future demand volumes are in many cases difficult to predict accurately  Some of Plains  rail may compete with pipelines and receive lower margins while some of it may sell at a premium due to lack of alternatives in the area  This is a chance that investors must take in assessing any of the midstream energy companies  Generally Plains has added rail where large pipeline alternatives do not exist to mitigate this risk  but it should not be expected that this scenario will hold true for all Plains future projects  One mitigating factor for the rail projects is that pipelines face political and environmental challenges that rail has tended to avoid thus far  Another is that pipelines are very costly  and rail can more quickly be implemented to support current market demand waiting on pipeline build out  Because U S  natural gas infrastructure is woefully behind  my instinct is that Plains will be fine  The rail expansion serves critical market needs and is profitable now  Likely it will be years before pipelines catch up to market demands and they may never meet all localized requirements for oil and gas products by themselves  Another risk for companies structured as MLPs are that most profits are distributed to the investors  As such  most expansion projects  being CAPEX intensive  are financed by share dilution and debt  Therefore  debt grades for PAA are one step above speculative  But I feel this rating is a bit misleading for those who understand how the sector operates in the long run  Normally I would warn away from companies that have relatively low operating margins and high debt levels  but in the case of energy MLPs I make an exception  I do not see many scenarios in a normal market hungry for grid power  transportation alternatives to rising oil costs  and cheap petrochemicals where income drops significantly for Plains and similar MLPs  Natural gas serves as a hedge for the trend of expensive oil and its byproducts and both products will experience strong demand  Plains  assets should be slowly and methodically be monetized by the market  In addition  Plains targets a near 50 50 debt to equity ratio in order to keep finance options balanced  Too much share dilution will reduce distributions while too much debt may scare away lenders and investors wary of future liquidity issues  The financing balance targeted by Plains management has appeared to work as planned so far  Plains  profits are fairly immune from market prices for oil  gas  and refined products because the company mostly operates as a toll road charging fees to various companies for transportation of the fuels  Certain parts of the company income including liquids re sales  storage  and fractionation fluctuate by demand for a given product  Those portions of the Plains portfolio  however  make up a minority share of the income stream for the company  Profits and distributions should remain fairly consistent and independent of market prices in a normal market  TaxationOne thing that must be mentioned with Master Limited Partnerships is that taxation for investors is treated differently by the IRS  Because income is not taxed twice  but passed down to investors  some of the income received from investment will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates and some will be taxed at capital gains rates  The National Association of Publicly Traded Partnerships has provided an easy to understand example of how MLPs are taxed  Taxes are assessed yearly on net income per unit owned  which equals income minus depreciation taken by the partnership   A K1 will be issued to each investor for their yearly taxes which details what is taxable  In addition  upon sale of the asset  the investor is taxed yet again  Essentially  any depreciation deducted each year the MLP is owned will be  recaptured  at sale at ordinary income tax rates  Capital gains are applied on the portion of cash distributions owing to growth in unit value  MLPs offer tax deferral of some taxation  but the taxation of recaptured depreciation at ordinary rates upon sale of the units can more than offset the tax deferral benefits depending on the unit yield  currently at 4 6  yearly for Plains  and holding time  Since the yield is taxed at the capital gains rate  MLPs which offer consistently rising yields over long time periods offer valuable tax shelters that may offset future ordinary income taxes for some investors  MLPs are a complicated investment vehicle for this reason  and each investor should consult with a tax professional before making any investment purchases to fully understand the tax implications  Financials As mentioned previously  Plains has a high debt to account for expansion  leading to a current ratio of 0 99 Data courtesy of Yahoo FinanceAccounts receivables and inventories exceed accounts payable  but not all current liabilities  Therefore  we know that Plains All American will need to use some future net income to offset these liabilities  The good news is that all assets  minus goodwill  are substantially larger than liabilities  This suggests that Plains has created value through recent investment and will need to monetize developments into positive cash flow over time  Investors should expect operating margin to increase somewhat  beyond Q3 of 4 1    due to strategically placed expansion projects and the ability to add value with the BP Canadian NGL acquisition  based upon management guidance  The most important accounting metrics I look at are Book Value  Price   Book Value  and Enterprise Value EV   EBITDA  The first  currently at 18 65 per share  provides a basement value for the stock in the event several negatives earnings announcements lead the market to a fear of default  and the price drops  If earnings estimates are wrong and income falls precipitously for the company  inventors can generally expect to get something near book value for their stock at least  Plains trades at 2 83 times book   52 78 price    18 65 book value  which is not an unreasonable figure  but high for my tastes  The company trades at a 13 54 EV   EBITDA which is high for any company that I consider buying  It suggests the company is  worth  13 54 times earnings potential to shareholders and debtors  I usually do not go above a measure of 10 EV   EBITDA  Note that I am very conservative investor regarding valuations  and I don t give much thought to competitor valuations in the same market  Too many times I have seen entire sectors become overvalued  rendering this analysis short sighted and potentially dangerous  Investors may have jumped the gun on Plains All American  and I would wait for a pullback before entering  Analysts expect Plains to beat earnings on February 6th  and the stock has run pretty high on expectations of extensive future growth yet to occur  Rising income will eventually 1  pay down debt and cause the company to 2  repurchase shares as they have in the past  while 3  raising cash distributions for investors in the process  But Plains is in expansion mode and current valuations shouldn t be supported in the near term  Technical IndicatorsThe yearly chart for PAA tells us that a slow  orderly climb has been replaced with a hard uptick in anticipation of earning announcements  However  technical indicators such as Stochastic and MACD indicate a leveling off on average volume  Last month s run wasn t based upon long term fundamentals  Even if earnings adhere to predictions  I expect the stock to retest the 50 day moving average around  45 per share  That could be your short term entry point  a week or two after earnings are announced this week  which will allow reasonable yield moving forward  Long term  I see the stock price leveling off lower than  45 and I personally would not enter into a long position until EV   EBITDA roughly equals a 10 multiple  Investing in MLPs  due to taxation and nature of oil and gas infrastructure build out is a long term proposition  Investors should consider all factors before placing money on this bet ,2013-02-05,Robert

158179,379695,PAAS,The Risks And Rewards Of Resource Companies,opinion,The risk reward profile of resource companies resemble those of healthcare and biotech companies  according to Brian Post  an analyst at ROTH Capital Partners  an investment bank dedicated to the small cap public market  Part of Post s mission is to educate his institutional clients about the value to be found in the resource sector  The value to be found in Mexico as a mining jurisdiction is one of the first lessons he offers  In his first interview with The Gold Report  Post focuses on Mexican silver names and ventures to both North and South America to talk copper   The Gold Report  Brian  you started out as an analyst in the industrial sector  What brought you to ROTH and into the resource space   Brian Post  ROTH saw an opportunity in the resource space  but lacked exposure to it  Once I familiarized myself with the technical aspects  I felt my previous experience was transferable  I now cover precious metals and some base metal assets  and in the last two years we have brought on an additional analyst who looks at resources from a cleantech perspective  which includes rare earths  other industrial metals and renewable energy  including uranium  We plan to build on this platform   TGR  When you speak to clients in Southern California  are they receptive to investing in resource stocks   BP  Looking solely at Southern California  investors are sparse  However  my contacts and outreach are global  including accounts in Europe  and we are gaining traction in investment hubs like New York  Toronto and San Francisco   ROTH is a small cap  growth boutique bank  Our strategic direction in the resource space has been to educate our existing institutional investor base those who are comfortable with growth stories about the value of investing in mining stocks  They are familiar with the risk reward profile of healthcare and biotech companies  which are relatively similar to resource companies   TGR  Looking at your coverage list  I see a lot of precious metals in Mexico  including several silver names  What is your rationale for investing in Mexico as a jurisdiction   BP  Given the geopolitical risk around the world  I made a conscious effort to look at companies operating in Mexico  It is one of the countries most friendly to mining development in today s environment   From a U S  point of view  there is concern about some social aspects in Mexico  However  global investors are much more comfortable and there is plenty of opportunity  The Mexican economy is growing  the resources are there and the government appears to have a pragmatic approach to balancing environmental and social protection needs with the economic impact of opening up mining projects  We believe Mexico is the place to be right now   TGR  Mexico is a premier address for silver  isn t it   BP  That is a function of the geology  Mexico hosts both silver and gold  My coverage universe has evolved to include a lot of silver names at the present time   Given the amount of investment and the activity from larger silver players in the region  we are comfortable with the infrastructure and the skill level of the labor force in Mexico  All the ingredients are there for continued development and exploitation of what nature has given the country   TGR  Would you call yourself a goldbug  A silver bull   BP  First and foremost  we are price takers  I have a positive bias on both gold and silver and have a stable to favorable outlook on both metals  We are not in the business of predicting price  We are  however  comfortable looking at projects and analyzing cash flows that assume metal prices  costs and cash margins sufficient to support the projects   TGR  In essence  you believe in the viability of a price that might not appreciate greatly  but will be stable   BP  That is a fair assessment   TGR  I would like to talk about the companies you cover that you believe have a growth profile in the next 12 months  starting with the producers   BP  Sure  SilverCrest Mines Inc   SVLC  is a growing producer with an exploration element to the story  It opened and is operating a straightforward  open pit  heap leach mine  However  the company is now making the move to underground development  where the grades on both silver and gold improve  It also is constructing a full on mill to process and recover some of the metal left behind from the heap leach operations  and to better exploit the higher grades it is encountering at depth   The picture for SilverCrest is getting better  with drill results showing even higher grades than anticipated  We expect a feasibility study in the next two to three months to provide some visibility into the value it is building underground   TGR  SilverCrest just announced a new vice president of corporate development   BP  That is part of the company s maturation  There is always the prospect of consolidation among companies like SilverCrest that have one or two institutional class portfolio assets  We may start to see some merger and acquisition activity in the junior resource space as a whole  which is something investors have been clamoring for  SilverCrest may be in a position to participate  potentially as either a target or as an acquirer   TGR  One would think that a good  low cost producer like SilverCrest might interest a large silver player like Pan American Silver Corp   PAA TSX  PAAS NASDAQ   First Majestic Silver Corp   FR TSX  AG NYSE  FMV FSE  or even Fresnillo Plc  FRES LSE    BP  I agree that there are synergies from the production and geographic standpoints  But I think SilverCrest is focused on ensuring its operations as now configured are productive  proving out some of the incremental value that comes with going underground  and derisking its exploration asset   Speaking of SilverCrest s exploration activity  the size and composition of La Joya  its exploration asset to the south  is growing  The company is just beginning to define the polymetallic opportunity there  gold  silver  copper  molybdenum and tungsten  There is a lot of potential in the shift from pure exploration and definition to defining an economic case for development   TGR  SilverCrest is trading around  2 50 share  Do you have a target price on it   BP  Our target price is  5   TGR  What other producers have silver assets in Mexico   BP  Aurcana Corporation  AUN TSX V  has assets in both Mexico and the U S  It has been running its main operating mine  La Negra  a silver base metal mine in Mexico  for a couple of years  It recently opened the Shafter project  a primary silver mine  about two hours outside of El Paso  on the Texas Mexico border  That is a growth story  in that Shafter s production is expected to ramp up   Aurcana ran into a few roadblocks getting the mine to commercial production  It underestimated the challenges of bringing mining labor back into that region  which really has not seen any mining for decades  I speak with Aurcana s management frequently  and the team has mechanisms in place to address these challenges and get the mine closer to its full potential   The Shafter mine should be up and running by the end of 2013  dispelling any concern about its viability  Shafter s ramped up production profile  paired with the growing operation at La Negra  should give Aurcana an attractive production profile  Its cash flow and financial metrics will move along in turn   TGR  Who else is active in Mexico   BP  Esperanza Resources Corp   EPZ TSX V  has been taken over by a new management group from Minefinders Corp   which was itself acquired by Pan American Silver  Esperanza is still relatively unknown  but we expect that to change quickly  Management is key to revitalizing the project  The project originally called Cerro Jumil has been around for a while but it is now on a fast track   The production versus capital expense  capex  profile here is attractive  It is shaping up to be a simple  open pit  heap leach operation capable of producing nearly 100 000 ounces  100 Koz  gold equivalent annually  The company is sitting on a treasury of about  40 million   40M  in cash  We estimate up front capital costs to be less than  100M   When you see a junior mining company with something this strong in the predevelopment stage  blended with a strong cash position relative to cost  the dilution profile down the line is significantly less than other projects  With the combination of a potent mine  low capex  good management and a good location  it is pretty easy to get excited about Esperanza   TGR  Does Esperanza also have silver credits   BP  There is a relatively small silver component  The geology is somewhat heterogeneous  but there is enough silver to provide a bump in ounces from the equivalent standpoint  Also  the silver provides the potential for streaming out that secondary production to bridge the equity after development  The silver adds incremental flexibility to the development plan  another important factor in getting projects like this going   TGR  With financing so difficult right now  it is good to have options   BP  Right  If you run the cash versus cost to develop numbers even assuming a conservative 50  debt financing we think there is less than a  20M equity gap to get this up and running  Compared to Esperanza s market cap  that is impressive   TGR  Where is the company in the development process   BP  Esperanza has submitted its plan and is working on permitting from the local jurisdictions and federal environmental perspectives  The Secretar a de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales is reviewing the plan  Based on the statutory timelines and even baking in some conservatism about delays  we think it can get all the necessary permits by the end of Q3 13   TGR  Are there any other companies in Mexico you would like to talk about   BP  We like Vista Gold Corp   VGZ   It has Mexican assets  but its flagship Mt  Todd project is in Australia  Mt  Todd posed challenges to its previous owner during a tough gold price environment in the mid 1990s  Vista Gold has invested time and money to better understand the root causes of these difficulties and we believe the project will become a mine again  Vista s new approach involves using high pressure grinding roll  HPGR  technology  which was not around in the 1990s  to handle the very hard rock on site  It has also figured out the rock chemistry  specifically how to handle the presence of copper in the deposit  which negatively impacted the past owner s operations   Mt  Todd has more than 4 million ounces  4 Moz  of established reserves  We expect that could go above 5 Moz  with the release of a feasibility study in H1 13  If this were a greenfield development  I would be less excited about it  especially given its capital cost profile  However  because it has been previously mined  infrastructure is in place and there is some flexibility and scalability in how the company can develop the project  we don t shy away from a project   TGR  Let s move back to North America  Are there other names that you like in this part of the world   BP  In addition to precious metals  we like a handful of copper opportunities   TGR  We hear talk of a global economic recovery  which would be positive for the price of copper  Do you like copper based on the prospect of a global economic recovery  or do you just like the metrics and valuations of specific companies in the copper space   BP  It is a blend of both  I am not ready to say I expect a very robust global recovery  But  given the growth in China and other emerging markets  demand for products that use copper remains at a healthy level  Pair that with the fact that some large mining projects around the world have been scaled back or delayed  and I am comfortable assuming the copper price will remain stable enough to give some copper projects a feasible environment  We feel comfortable with copper above  2 75 3 pound to support development of some of these projects   TGR  Given that backdrop  which copper names do you like   BP  One that I cover in the U S  is an early  to midstage exploration company called Redhawk Resources Inc   RDK TSX   based in Arizona  It has been defining the Copper Creek project near Tucson as a viable  relatively large scale  emerging copper project in the shadow of other big operations nearby   TGR  Have you visited   BP  I have visited and spent time with management  Redhawk has transitioned the development plan  which started out targeting the higher grade breccias scattered throughout the site  to incorporate a porphyry system that sits underneath the breccias  The porphyry portion exhibits favorable geology that compares to some of the bigger projects in the U S  and South America  It is still early days  and the company will need deep pockets to realize the grand plan  But as far as scope  geology and location go  it is a good mix   TGR  The copper business in Arizona appears to be alive  well and moving forward  Augusta Resource Corp   AZC  just received a key permit there   BP  We do not cover Augusta and its Rosemont project  but we keep close track  It is a good  but not perfect  proxy for permitting   Rosemont is in Pima County  The Copper Creek project is in Pinal County  I know it may sound like minutiae  but which county you are in influences the permitting process  Given some of the other major operations are located in Pinal  it is even friendlier than Pima County   TGR  Are there other copper assets you like   BP  One that we cover as a firm and that has always been on my radar is Amerigo Resources Ltd   ARG TSX   It is based very close to Corporaci n Nacional del Cobre de Chile s  CODELCO s  operation  El Teniente  in Chile   People overlook Amerigo because of a misconception about what the company does  It processes copper using fresh  lower grade tailings from CODELCO s operations as feedstock  The company also has contractual access to reprocess some of the historic tailings from El Teniente dating back to the 1970s and 1980s  Today s technology and operations are so much more efficient that you can recover higher portions of copper  even from tailings   In 2012  Amerigo s production profile eclipsed 50 million pounds  50 Mlb  copper  It also got about 1 Mlb in molybdenum production from its operations  It may be better suited to look at it as an industrial processing company and production story   TGR  Does Amerigo process its own tailings as well   BP  No  it has two feedstocks  Roughly two thirds of the material coming into its plant are direct  fresh tailings from a channel out of the mouth of El Teniente  This fresh feedstock is processed with modern equipment and is low grade   The older feedstock comes from El Teniente s old tailing dumps  The older feedstock is much richer in copper  Aside from the unique material  Amerigo looks like a typical copper production  There are ball mills there  flotation  thickening ponds   TGR  What is the agreement between Amerigo and CODELCO   BP  Amerigo pays a per pound royalty to CODELCO   TGR  Where is Amerigo headquartered   BP  In Vancouver  however  the operations are all on site just outside of Santiago  Chile   TGR  Amerigo is a very lightly traded stock  with around a  120M market cap  showing some share price appreciation in recent weeks   BP  It has had a good year to date  Underlying the story itself is a dramatic shift in the company s cost structure  effective Jan  1   A bit of background  Under the terms of its original power contract  Amerigo s cost of power was dictated by the marginal costs of production of power in Chile  which are quite high  Years ago  Jan  1  2013  was chosen as a date for an automatic reset to another pricing equation  This equated to a 40 50  decrease in Amerigo s electricity costs  or roughly 25  of the company s overall per pound cost   Looking at the whole story  you have a growing and improving production profile paired with a decreasing cost profile  This makes the financial metrics very attractive  And to sweeten the story  Amerigo pays a semiannual dividend at a run rate of about  0 04 share per year   TGR  That is rare in a company with this kind of market cap   BP  Correct  In addition  Amerigo is negotiating with CODELCO to potentially increase production by gaining access to even richer tailings  Right now  Amerigo s infrastructure and contract rates limit it to roughly a 50 Mlb year run rate in copper  Increasing production would require some infrastructure investment  but CODELCO may be willing to help with project financing  There are a lot of interesting elements to this story  a lot of positive tailwinds   TGR  Where does it stand from a treasury perspective   BP  It has not yet reported its full year balance sheet  It ended Q3 12 with  35 6M in cash   TGR

158180,379696,PAAS,Closer Look At Plains All American Pipeline s Distributable Cash Flow,opinion,On February 27  2013  Plains All American Pipeline L P   PAA  provided its 2012 annual report on Form 10 K  Results compared favorably to the prior year and to management s guidance  Revenues  operating income  net income and earnings before interest  depreciation   amortization and income tax expenses  EBITDA  are summarized in Table 1  On 11 5 12  the mid point of the Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2012 was  2 017 million  a  7  increase vs  the guidance provided on 8 6 12 and  22  over the full year guidance provided at the beginning of the year  On that date the preliminary Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2013 was  1 925 million  mid point   On 2 6 13 PAA increased its 2013 guidance to  1 976 million  but still a number lower than what was achieved in 2012  This is because management is operating on the assumption that 2012 was a year in which market conditions were extremely favorable for the Supply and Logistics segment  and that 2013 will see a  a return to baseline  after 1Q13  Strong performance was exhibited by all segments  as seen in Table 2  In 3Q12 PAA decided not to proceed with the Pier 400 project and wrote down a substantial portion of its investment in it  The write down amounted to   125 million and is reflected in Table 2 as an increase to depreciation   amortization  Hence the large increase in this line item in 2012 vs  the prior year periods  The Pier 400 terminal project involved development of a deepwater petroleum import terminal at Pier 400 and Terminal Island in the Port of Los Angeles for the purpose of handling marine receipts of crude oil and refinery feedstock  Unlike the Facilities and Transportation segments which are predominantly fee based businesses  Supply   Logistics is margin based and hence its results are more volatile  This segment has benefited from higher volumes and higher margins  Increased drilling activities and increased production of oil and natural gas liquids   NGL   in the areas it services  Bakken  Eagle Ford  West Texas  Western Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle  drove higher volumes  Margins were driven higher because production volumes exceed existing pipeline takeaway capacity in these regions  so customers will pay more to whoever can get their products to markets  Supply demand imbalances also increased the volatility of historical differentials for various grades of crude oil and also impacted the historical pricing relationship between NGL and crude oil  Market conditions in 2011 and 2012 were thus highly favorable to the Supply   Logistics segment  Management is being appropriately cautious in assuming that these conditions may not be repeated in 2013  In an article titled Distributable Cash Flow   DCF   I present the definition of DCF used by Plains All American Pipeline L P   PAA  and provide a comparison to definitions used by other master limited partnerships  Using PAA s definition  DCF in 2012 was  1 550 million   4 73 per unit   up from  1 149 million   3 84 per unit  in 2011  As always  I first attempt to assess how these figures compare with what I call sustainable DCF for these periods and whether distributions were funded by additional debt or issuing additional units  The generic reasons why DCF as reported by the MLP may differ from sustainable DCF are reviewed in an article titled   Applying the method described there to PAA s results through 12 31 12 generates the comparison outlined in Table 3 below  The principal differences between reported DCF and sustainable DCF relate working capital  risk management activities and a variety of items grouped under  Other   Under PAA s definition  reported DCF always excludes working capital changes  whether positive or negative  My definition of sustainable DCF only excludes working capital generated  I deduct working capital consumed   Despite appearing to be inconsistent  this makes sense because in order to meet my definition of sustainability the MLP should generate enough capital to cover normal working capital needs  On the other hand  cash generated by the MLP through the liquidation or reduction of working capital is not a sustainable source and I therefore ignore it  Over reasonably lengthy measurement periods  working capital generated tends to be offset by needs to invest in working capital  A good example of this is provided by the working capital lines for 2011 and 2012 in Table 3  In 2012 working capital consumed cash principally due to an increase in crude oil inventories  while in 2011 crude oil inventories were liquidated and thus generated a very significant amount of cash  Overall  in 2012 working capital consumed cash amounting to  466 million  Management adds back this amount in deriving reported DCF while I do not  The  193 million adjustment for risk management activities in 2012 consists primarily of foreign currency adjustments and losses from derivative activities  Management adds back these losses in calculating reported DCF  I do not do so when calculating sustainable DCF The  212 million adjustment for  Other  items in 2012 consists of non cash compensation  losses on inventory valuation adjustments  and distributions in excess of earnings from unconsolidated investments  Again  management adds back these items in calculating reported DCF  I do not do so when calculating sustainable DCF PAA increased DCF guidance for 2012 to a mid point of  1 437 million  up from  1 352 million guidance provided last November   but still lower than 2012 reported DCF for the same reasons outlined in the discussion of Table 1  As seen in Table 3  the differences between reported and sustainable DCF can be pronounced  This  of course  impacts coverage ratios  as indicated in Table 4 below I find it helpful to look at a simplified cash flow statement by netting certain items  e g   acquisitions against dispositions  and by separating cash generation from cash consumption  Here is what I see for PAA  Simplified Sources and Uses of FundsNet cash from operations  less maintenance capital expenditures  less cash related to net income attributable to non controlling partners exceeded distributions by  101 million in 2012 and by  1 454 million in 2011  The large difference between the excess in these two years is due to changes in crude oil inventories  increase in 2012  decrease in 2011  as explained in the discussion of Table 3   Clearly PAA is not using cash raised from issuance of debt and equity to fund distributions  Over the past 5 years  2008 2012  net cash from operations generated a cumulative excess of   962 million  after deducting maintenance capital expenditures  net income from non controlling interests  and distributions   Such excesses constitute significant sources of capital for PAA and reduce reliance on debt or issuance of additional units that dilute existing holders  This is of particular importance to PAA limited partners because issuing new units is very expensive due to the general partner s incentive distribution rights   IDR    The IDRs entitle the general partner to 48  of amounts distributed in excess of  0 3375 per unit  Therefore at the current distribution rate of  0 5625 per quarter  each additional unit issued consumes   0 88 of DCF per quarter  This is a heavy burden that pushes up PAA s cost of capital  The excess cash flow has a very low cost of capital compared to the cost of issuing additional units  PAA s current yield is at the low end of the MLP universe  A comparison to some of the MLPs I follow is provided in Table 6 below PAA  EPD and MMP are all outstanding MLPs  The relatively low yields notwithstanding  their operational results have been excellent and have driven up unit prices  thus generating significant capital gains for the partners  They are a solid choice for more conservative MLP investors  My concerns with PAA revolve around capital structure and the sharper run up in its unit price  From a capital structure standpoint  EPD and MMP are not burdened by IDRs while PAA pays 48  at the margin  While the IDR burden is less of an issue with respect to organic growth  because of the low ratio of required investment to the expected cash flow it will generate   it is a major factor in large acquisitions which  under current market conditions  command high multiples and require lengthy time periods to generate the projected synergies  From a price per unit standpoint  year to date PAA s unit price is up  20  vs  15  for EPD and  16  for MMP ,2013-03-13,Ron Hiram,https://www.investing.com/analysis/closer-look-at-plains-all-american-pipeline’s-distributable-cash-flow-158827,158827
158186,379702,PAAS,Will We See A Silver Breakout In 2013 ,opinion,Silver has been trading sideways so far in 2013  but what will the rest of the year bring  Will 2013 be the year silver prices break out or crash and burn  What is a sustainable silver price for mining companies and where will the metal come from to supply the next generation of industrial and investment demand  Most important  how can investors make money off this volatile sector  These were the burning questions The Gold Report took to analysts  money managers and heads of silver mining companies  The answers may surprise you  In an impromptu poll at The Prospectors   Developers Association of Canada Convention  PDAC  in 2012  attendees were decidedly positive as they cited increased demand for silver from sources such as electronics  solar panels and medical uses  in addition to use as an investment vehicle  One year later  Jeffrey Christian  managing partner of CPM Group and the author of the investing book  Commodities Rising   predicts a 2 8  increase in silver demand on the fabrication front after a 1 2  rise in 2012 when solar panel use of silver actually fell about 25    Economic conditions actually may be a bit stronger in the U S   China and a few other major markets this year than they were last year and solar panel use may stabilize   he said   The lower silver prices we anticipate would help boost demand   The key sector to watch  he says  is jewelry and silverware  as that is the most price sensitive demand sector and uses more silver than any other segment of the market  On the investment side  continued political squabbling can have an impact on overall stock prices  but Christian posits that the market is getting tired of politicians playing games and becoming inured to the cacophony   Investors have heard a steady pounding about the imminent collapse of the U S  dollar  the Treasury  the euro  the ECB  and the global financial and banking systems since 2008   he said   We have had some really bad conditions  but the worst predictions have not happened  Investors are realizing the real problems are not the manufactured and overly hyped machinations in Washington  but the inability of government leaders to seriously address the long term deficit issues  Therefore  they are shifting from investing based on fears of an imminent catastrophic collapse of the global financial system to investing based on the expectation that the next many decades will see sub par economic growth  sub par stock market and bond market performance  persistent high unemployment  and massive deficit and debt problems in the industrialized economies   David Morgan  editor of Silver Investor com  explained that investment demand is counterintuitive  The higher the price  the higher the demand   I am optimistic the price will increase  but it will not be a huge increase  There will be some spikes due to derivative plays  quick buck artists driving the price up randomly as they did in April 2011  Underlying that is solid buying from hedge funds  Buying begets buying and silver is a darling of momentum players   He  too  believes that government crises like the debt ceiling are irrelevant as they are already priced in   Central banks have one tool  to debase currency  We all know that   SilverStrategies com Editor Sean Rakhimov sees industrial demand remaining robust over the next few years   The cost of the silver portion of the end product is still insignificant relative to the price of the product itself   Rakhimov explains  The exception is the solar panel industry  which accounts for some 130 million ounces  130 Moz  or 15  of the global silver supply   The solar panel industry is likely to be more materially affected by the rising silver price   Rakhimov explains   yet  I do not see it being a decisive factor in determining the price of silver  I believe the demand fundamentals for silver will remain favorable for a continued bull market for the duration of this cycle of which we are about half way through   On the supply side of the equation  silver production is less sensitive to the price of silver than many other metals because it is largely a byproduct  Bob Archer  CEO of Great Panther Silver Ltd   GPR TSX  GPL NYSE MKT   which generates almost 70  of its revenue from silver and some 20  from gold production  pointed out that as much as 77  of silver produced globally each year comes as a result of mining for other metals  Depending on whether it is coming with gold  copper or zinc  the silver credit can be an afterthought in the decision to go ahead with production   Often the silver credit is not important  It is more a function of what the primary metal will be   he says  Ross Beaty  chairman of Pan American Silver Corp   PAA TSX  PAAS NASDAQ  among other ventures  counters that the same inflationary pressures impacting silver also effect other metals  thereby limiting new silver production from both sources  He uses the example of the 35 Moz Pascua Lama gold and silver mine Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  decided to build six years ago on the border of Chile and Argentina at an estimated cost of  4 billion   4B  over three years   It could be one of the biggest silver mines in the world  but the mine is nowhere near completion and could be  10B by the time it is done  It s causing a severe stress to Barrick  the world s largest gold producer  Barrick will get the mine built  it s just taking a lot longer and costs a huge amount  more than anticipated  and it will make it or any company rethink any decision to do the same thing again  That will  over the long run  tend to constrain new supply   One of the world s biggest silver investors  Eric Sprott  pointed to the availability ratio between silver and gold for why the metal price could jump from  30 ounce   30 oz  to as high as  200 oz as he predicted in a recent   He quotes statistics that show once the industrial use of silver and gold is subtracted from the production and recycling new supply calculations  three times more silver is available for purchase each year than gold  However sales of gold and silver at the U S  Mint  through exchange traded funds  ETFs  and Sprott s own Physical Trust  show that investors are buying many multiples more silver than gold and have been for years  Sprott firmly believes that outsized demand in such a relatively small market   9 trillion for gold and  150 million for silver  will result in price inflation   We are surprised that the price of silver has remained at such a depressed level compared to gold  Historically  the price ratio between gold and silver has been 16 1  Today the ratio is 55 1  so what are the numbers telling us  We believe this is one of those times when smart investors will be well rewarded if they follow the money   When predicting the silver price  CPM Group s Christian was conservative   A year ago we said the silver market had peaked in April 2011 and was headed lower  Our view was that silver would average  29 90 oz in 2012  down 11 7  from  35 29 oz in 2011  The price averaged  31 17 oz in 2012  We thought it would not trade above  36 oz during 2012  It settled above  36 oz on only one day  Feb  28  For 2013  we projected an average price of  26 75 oz  We think the price may not rise above  33 oz this year  or  35 oz at the most   He based the lower silver price on the belief that investors  will grow suspicious about all the hype of silver going to  50 oz or higher   SilverStrategies com s Rakhimov believes silver is in the second half of the bull market and expects increased volatility and acceleration of the trend   I expect higher prices substantially higher prices toward the end of 2013 and into 2014  not unlike the trend we saw in 2010 2011   He predicts the bond market will be the catalyst propelling silver upward  as bonds are increasingly struggling to provide safety and investors look for other safe havens   I expect new highs in both silver and gold in the next couple of years and that may prove to be a conservative outlook   Rakhimov explains  How much per ounce does silver have to be in order to make most of the new projects out there economic  We asked those closest to the ground  Beaty  whose Pan American Silver produced 25 1 Moz last year  says that while most companies can make money at  30 oz  rising costs are hitting bottom lines across the industry   Whether open pit or underground mine  from exploration to production the price is multiples higher than it was a decade or even five years ago   Add to rising energy and labor costs  specific country challenges  social  political and environmental realities and unique geological conditions and the capital pressure is immense  Beaty stresses that investors look at total costs  He called  cash costs  a  ridiculous notion that means almost nothing   To really understand the return on equity  he suggests that investors look at the capital costs  which show up as a depreciation per ounce cost in annual reports  and direct operating costs along with royalties  taxes and social payments  That doesn t even include the price of exploring for replacements for depleted ounces   When you add all of those together  what might show up as  10 cash cost oz becomes  25 oz  If you are getting  30 oz  you don t have much delta there for a dividend or in case unforeseen things happen  Margins are slimmer and if there s any weakness in the silver price  a lot of silver mines are going to be in distress   Ever the optimist  however  Beaty points out that the challenges facing companies to build and operate mines should lead to constrained supply and increased prices  Ron Nichols  CEO of Dolly Varden Silver Corp   does not see one silver price determining the economic viability of silver mines  He explains   There will be a range of prices where a silver price as low as  10 oz may make sense for a large high grade underground deposit  A low grade  open pit scenario would likely need a much higher silver price to make the economics of a large tonnage operation processing much lower grades work in order to pay back the much higher capital needed to get the project up and running   The grade of the deposit and the style of the silver mineralization are important factors  Archer  whose Great Panther Silver operates the Guanajuato mine complex in Mexico  blames competition for increasing labor costs  particularly at the managerial level   There is a ripple effect  Higher labor costs  materials costs and lead times are making capital costs so much higher   Despite the number of companies with depressed share prices and bank accounts  Archer says he does not anticipate a lot of mergers taking place this year   It is important to have the right deal   he says  His company has been looking  but hasn t found the right opportunity  Beaty also predicts 2013 would result in fewer deals   Across the board in the mining industry  companies are less interested in growing simply for the sake of growing and more interested in their bottom line  Shareholders are demanding a return and companies have been very poor in the mining industry at using their cash flow well  There s been a real revolt among many shareholders asking for bigger dividends   Pan American bought Mindfinders in 2011 2012 and Beaty says the company is always looking at deals  but not necessarily looking for deals  It has focused more recently on increasing its dividend and buying back stock   Don t forget it s not just the exploration stocks that are cheap  It s also some of the producing companies  Generally there are a lot lower multiples for mining companies today than there used to be  That factors into less of an interest in acquiring other companies in this market   Nichols sees the fight for survival leading to some M A deals   It is probably inevitable that some companies combine in one way or another to cut down on overhead  and pool their properties to increase their prospects for discovery   Many early stage exploration companies are running out of funding options   Alternative financing really only comes into play at a more advanced stage such as the scoping study level or prefeasibility stage  Precious metal streaming companies are an option if the company is at or near production  but these work best for purchasing metals that are not the main economic commodity being exploited  Royalty companies are also likely to be a more viable alternative to advanced stage companies  However  I suspect that a great number of junior companies simply cannot display enough in the way of solid potential to attract financing in this type of market   Morgan predicts that while there will be some mergers and acquisitions  the more common fate will be a slow death as companies run out of money  The where silver companies will be located question probably won t change either  Two Latin American countries Mexico and Peru account for one third of the world silver production and the experts don t see a shift happening anytime soon  Archer sees Mexico as still possessing lots of opportunity   It has great geology and the country only recently opened the doors to exploring again  so there is a lot of upside   Beaty agrees because of the realities of geology regardless of country risk   Mines are built where silver tends to be  Mexico and Peru happen to have rocks that tend to contain more silver than anywhere else on the planet  so new silver mines tend to be there  There are only about 30 or so silver mines in the world  It s a very small number relative to the number of gold mines and copper mines   He cautions that companies have to do everything right in getting their social licenses and looking after the environmental aspects of mine development  but he sees the governments as friendly to foreign investors   They have not initiated the negative policies that some other neighboring countries like Bolivia and Argentina have enacted  They have good central banks  They re just great places to be so I think that will continue   Nichols believes Canada is a good jurisdiction for silver mining  being one of the top ten silver producing nations  Many areas with a history of high grade production are being looked at again in light of higher silver prices  which Nichols predicts will lead to an increase in Canada s silver production   Operating in a stable  mining friendly country like Canada certainly is a positive factor that cannot be under estimated   Wherever in the world they invest  CPM Group s Christian warns investors to  buy and hold silver intelligently  which may include hedging existing positions and buying when prices fall instead of when they are rising   Even equity investors can hedge by putting puts on commodities to take some of the risk out of the portfolio  That is what he did for clients during the fiscal cliff when he saw the false euphoria and intuited that prices would fall once people realized that it was a manufactured problem and others loomed   We believe investors should hold silver as part of their portfolios   Christian says   The period of sharp capital appreciation in silver prices may be behind the market  at least for the next few years  Even so  owning some silver makes sense as a portfolio diversification move  as a capital preservation tool  and as a safe haven   He is also positive about the equities behind the metal   Some excellent silver mining companies represent growth stocks by producing silver at attractive prices  These companies could outperform silver over the next couple of years  The issue is discriminating between the companies that reasonably can be expected to perform well and the myriad of mining and exploration companies that probably represent bad investment opportunities   DISCLOSURE  1  The following

Haynesville Partnership Co    HPC    which owns a 450 mile intrastate pipeline that delivers natural gas from northwest Louisiana to downstream pipelines and markets   2  a 50  membership interest in Midcontinent Express Pipeline LLC   MEP    which owns an interstate natural gas pipeline with approximately 500 miles stretching from southeast Oklahoma through northeast Texas  northern Louisiana and central Mississippi to an interconnect with the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line system in Butler  Alabama  and  3  a 30  membership interest in Lone Star  an entity owning a diverse set of midstream energy assets including NGL pipelines  storage  fractionation and processing facilities located in the states of Texas  Mississippi and Louisiana  Income from these unconsolidated affiliates in 2Q12 vs  2Q11 and in 1H12 vs  1H11 is summarized below  As indicated by Table 3  the primary driver of performance for the Joint Ventures segment is Lone Star which became operational in May 2011 and provided a full quarter s contribution in 2Q12  Given quarterly fluctuations in revenues  working capital needs and other items  it makes sense to review trailing 12 months   TTM   numbers rather than quarterly numbers for the purpose of analyzing changes in reported and sustainable distributable cash flows  RGP s definition of Distributable Cash Flow   DCF   and a comparison to definitions used by other master limited partnerships   MLPs   are described in an article titled   Using that definition  DCF for the trailing 12 months   TTM   period ending 6 30 12 was  330 million   2 09 per unit   up from  256 million   1 89 per unit  in the comparable prior year period  As always  I first attempt to assess how these DCF figures compare with what I call sustainable DCF for these periods and whether distributions were funded by additional debt or issuing additional units  Given quarterly fluctuations in revenues  working capital needs and other items  it makes sense to review TTM numbers rather than quarterly numbers for the purpose of analyzing changes in reported and sustainable distributable cash flows  The generic reasons why DCF as reported by the MLP may differ from sustainable DCF are reviewed   Applying the method described there to RGP s results through 1Q 2012 generates the comparison outlined in the table below   The principal differences between reported DCF and sustainable DCF relate to working capital  proceeds from asset sales  and RGP s substantial  but non controlling  stakes in the entities within its Joint Ventures segment  Under RGP s definition  reported DCF always excludes working capital changes  whether positive or negative  In contrast  as detailed in my prior articles  I generally do not include working capital generated in the definition of sustainable DCF but I do deduct working capital invested  this accounts for  24 million of the variance between reported and sustainable DCF in 2Q12   Despite appearing to be inconsistent  this makes sense because in order to meet my definition of sustainability the master limited partnerships should  on the one hand  generate enough capital to cover normal working capital needs  On the other hand  cash generated from working capital is not a sustainable source and I therefore ignore it  Over reasonably lengthy measurement periods  working capital generated tends to be offset by needs to invest in working capital  I therefore do not add working capital consumed to net cash provided by operating activities in deriving sustainable DCF  Similarly  I also do not add back into DCF items I do not regard as sustainable  such as proceeds from asset sales  The largest variance between reported and sustainable DCF related to RGP s substantial  but non controlling  stakes in the entities within its Joint Ventures segment  Pursuant to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  GAAP   the Partnership records its share of the net income in these other pipelines as income from unconsolidated affiliates in accordance with the equity method of accounting  However  for purposes of calculating DCF  RGP treats these as if they were fully consolidated by deducting its share of net income  adding its share of the earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation   amortization  EBITDA   and further adjusting to take into account its share of interest expense and maintenance capital expenditures  On the one hand  I can accept classifying RGP s share of cash flows generated from these entities in the sustainable category despite the fact that RGP does not control them  i e   cannot determine what to do with the cash they generate   This is because they are similar in every other respect to RGP s other pipeline assets and because RGP and or Energy Transfer Equity  L P   ETE   RGP s general partner  do exercise a significant degree of influence over them  On the other hand  RGP s share of cash flows generated from these entities  which accounts for the bulk of the  76 million and the  42 million in the  Other  line item  does not  as of the date of the report  appear on RGP s balance sheet and does not increase RGP s end of period cash balance  Coverage ratios  with and without this line item  are as indicated in the table below  Whichever way you look at it  these are thin coverage ratios I find it helpful to look at a simplified cash flow statement by netting certain items  e g   acquisitions against dispositions  and by separating cash generation from cash consumption  Here is what I see for RGP Simplified Sources and Uses of FundsNet cash from operations  less maintenance capital expenditures  less net income from non controlling interests did not cover distributions in both periods  The shortfall was  96 million for the TTM ending 6 30 12 and  45 million for the comparable prior year period  Table 6 therefore shows that distributions in both TTM periods were partially financed by issuing equity and debt  despite the fact that RGP s reported DCF exceeded the amount distributed  as shown in Tables 4 and 5   The reason  as previously noted  is that reported DCF included items that never make it into the cash flow statement  i e   cash flows from the non consolidated pipelines and some other adjustments  Growth capital expenditures in 2012  including capital contributions to RGP s unconsolidated affiliates  i e   the non controlling  stakes in other pipelines   are expected to total   800 million  of which    373 million was expended in 1H 2012  With long term debt at  4 4x EBITDA for the TTM ending 6 30 12 and over  400 million of growth capital expenditures required in 2H 2012  I would not be surprised to see additional equity issuances in 2012  The projects being financed will begin to impact RGP s results only in 2013 2014 Energy Transfer Equity  L P   ETE   RGP s general partner  is entitled  via its incentive distribution rights   IDRs    to 48  of any increase in RGP s current distributions  RGP is at a significant disadvantage in terms of cost of capital compared to MLPs who are at a lower threshold or have eliminated IDRs altogether  Roughly speaking  an incremental project must generate  15 4  cash return of which  7 4   48   would be distributed to ETE and  8  to the limited partners As of 8 24 12  RGP s current yield of 8  is higher than of most of the other MLPs I cover  For example  4 60  for Magellan Midstream Partners  MMP   4 82  for Enterprise Products Partners L P   EPD   4 93  for Plains All American Pipeline  PAA   6 02  for Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  KMP   6 20  for El Paso Pipeline Partners  EPB   6 22  for Williams Partners  WPZ   6 41  for Targa Resources Partners  NGLS   and 7 92  for Boardwalk Pipeline Partners  BWP   RGP s yield is lower than the 8 52  offered by Buckeye Partner  BPL  and the 8 48  by its affiliate  Energy Transfer Partners  ETP  In light of the low coverage ratio  the relatively high leverage and my discomfort with the structural complexity surrounding ETE and ETP  I would stay on the sidelines despite the attractive yield ,2012-08-26,Ron

158208,379724,PAAS,David Goguen   Senior Golds Look To Juniors For Growth ,opinion,Senior producers seeking to replenish depleted gold reserves will be looking to promising juniors to provide needed ounces  suggests Dave Goguen  director of institutional sales for PI Financial Corp  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Goguen provides his views on where senior gold producers will be hunting and which companies will meet newly stringent criteria in the risk averse but increasingly gold hungry world marketplace of today and tomorrow  The Gold Report  Dave  tell us a little bit about PI Financial  David Goguen  PI Financial Corp   PI  is one of Canada s largest  independent  employee owned full service investment dealers  PI has been advising and financing the mining sector for the past 30 years and I have been providing resource sales coverage to institutional clients for over 15 years  TGR  It s been a tumultuous year in the mining space  Maybe gold prices haven t hit the highs that we saw in 2011  but with prices hovering around  1 700 oz  most gold producers can make a profit  On the other hand  equities particularly the mid caps  small caps and micro caps have been decimated by summer doldrums or investor disinterest  PI Financial obviously sees opportunity in the mining sector  DG  A very good proxy for the senior gold companies is the Van Eck Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  GDX   Going back 12 months from today  this ETF is down 23   Over the same period  the Market Vectors Junior Miners ETF  GDXJ  is down considerably more  by 39   I think a key reason for the underperformance is due to the recent challenges that juniors have had to face in raising capital to fund continuing exploration and development  Historically  smaller and less liquid mining companies are hardest hit in a risk averse   risk off  market  The junior mining sector is delivering a lot of technical studies that have been underway for the last year  These studies will provide the insights by which investors will choose certain development projects over others as they assess capital cost of construction and project rates of return  This process will see investors supporting companies that they expect will lead the way in the next cycle  TGR  You ve predicted that some of these junior miners will have a recovery in the fall  Could senior producers that need to replace reserves be shopping for mid size junior companies with promising projects to acquire  Do you see merger and acquisition  M A  activity in the fall and going into 2013  DG  I agree that there will be mergers and acquisitions  driven by poor returns on some senior gold producers  larger capital development projects  Looking back on the second quarter reporting season  which just ended  commentary reflects management and shareholder displeasure with the rate of return on some of the larger capital development projects  Unanticipated project cost escalation due to increased capital expenditures  capex   schedule extensions and geopolitical risk has meant that the cost of executing on these construction programs exceeded what was originally factored into budgets by a very wide margin  Barrick Gold Corp  s  ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  statement that  returns drive production instead of production driving returns  has become a new mantra echoing among senior gold companies  Projects are going to be assessed with a more critical evaluation of risk adjusted returns  and capital allocation discipline is really going to be stressed  We would expect greater scrutiny of some of the more marginal projects in the development pipeline  some of which may be put on hold or even canceled  A prime example from the base metal space is BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP NYSE  BHPLF OTCPK  putting  63 billion of capital programs on hold  Barrick Gold has suspended projects as well  TGR  If senior companies use more fiscal discipline and scrutinize potential acquisitions more carefully  won t margins improve and financials look correspondingly better  Couldn t this be a positive thing for shareholders  DG  Fewer projects will satisfy the decision criteria for development and construction  With fewer projects launched and fewer marginal ounces coming onstream  there is going to be reduced supply in the global gold market  As development projects idle and the effects are felt in future production and global supply numbers  there will be a resulting reduction in gold supply or at minimum a reduction in future supply growth  This  in turn  should mean higher gold prices in the intermediate and longer term and should be positive for the junior gold companies  TGR  What else will that mean  DG  In the past  the capital requirements and capital risk of developing larger projects especially larger projects in remote locations has been underestimated  As a result  the majors will likely look at smaller projects  instead of the larger ones previously targeted  These projects are potential producers of  perhaps  200 000 to 400 000 ounces  oz  year  instead of 500 000  oz year  Their development cycle is shorter and their ultimate capital costs can be contained  These are the smaller projects held by some of the junior companies that we follow  Investors should focus on companies with projects that are amenable to phased development and can be scaled up offering smaller initial capital outlays and future expansions funded out of project level cash flows  TGR  So the majors are going to be looking at smaller projects with lower capex requirements and higher margins  as opposed to pursuing larger development programs in more remote places with smaller margins  DG  Exactly  TGR  Given that backdrop  in what parts of the world are majors going to be sniffing around  DG  We would focus on Latin American based projects  Latin America has historically had one the highest allocations of exploration capital  PI Financial produces a quantitative research piece called  Select Golds  that focuses on Latin American precious metal companies  We examine advanced explorers  emerging producers and junior producers  We track their evolution and progression through each of those categories and into production  TGR  In what countries  DG  We specifically like Mexico  The geology is excellent and continues to yield new discoveries both in precious metals and in base metals  Mining has a long history in Mexico  There is an ample skilled labor force and a strong network of technical suppliers and technical services  Permitting and mining laws are transparent  with a record of fair treatment  Technical submissions and permit applications are responded to and processed by the various ministries in a timely manner  Mining is socially accepted in Mexico  A good example of a locale that provides technical services to mines and to development projects within the Sierra Madre is Hermosillo  Mexico has proven its ability to cater to companies that are developing assets there  Brazil is also well regarded for supporting mining exploration and development  Processes for getting approvals are both well laid out and well understood  Brazil also has the bureaucratic infrastructure to approve permits  So  the path from development to production in Brazil is a relatively straightforward one  TGR  What are some particularly promising companies and projects in Brazil  DG  In Brazil  the Volta Grande project is being developed and advanced by Belo Sun Mining Corp   BSX TSX V   This project has a lot going for it  It has attractive size  with over 5 million ounces  Moz  Measured and Indicated and Inferred  It has attractive grade  at 1 7 grams per ton  g t  gold  The resource should support a meaningful production profile  likely 250 000 to 350 000 oz year  And  the deposit sits in a prospective greenstone belt that is 100  controlled by Belo Sun  So  if a major were to come in and acquire Belo Sun for the Volta Grande project  that major would also expect the benefit of an entire greenstone belt package on which to fund continued exploration  while maximizing purchase value through additional discovery within the prospective belt  TGR  What other Latin American companies that might be not as well developed as Belo Sun offer potential for M A  DG  Considering the new criteria for M A interest that we ve discussed  in Mexico  Torex Gold Resources Inc   TXG TSX  would certainly be a company the majors could be looking at  Torex has 4 8 Moz in the Measured and Indicated category with a grade of 2 79 g t  This open pit development is expected to be ready to begin construction in mid 2013  with production by early 2015  And  Torex is due to deliver a feasibility study shortly  It is my belief that this study will further validate the project and show that it has sufficient resource to merit interest from intermediates and majors  TGR  Is this in the Hermosillo area you mentioned  It looks as if it s actually relatively close to Mexico City  DG  Torex is in the state of Guerrero  within the Guerrero Gold Belt  Torex has features that make it an attractive acquisition candidate  with a project located in a productive gold belt that has geological exploration upside potential and future optionality on discovery  Any prospective buyer of Torex is ultimately going to enjoy the benefits of any subsequent discoveries in the belt  TGR  Torex is also an unusual company because it has a sizeable treasury at this point  DG  Yes  Torex has  69 million  M  in cash as of July 31  2012  But  with delivery of a feasibility study expected soon  this capital will be needed for long lead time expenditures  The capex on this project is going to be somewhere in the  500 700M range  and that means equity and debt financing will be needed  TGR  What other names are there in Mexico  DG  Timmins Gold Corp   TMM TSX V  TGD NYSE A  is in Sonora  Mexico  Timmins started production approximately two years ago and is on track to produce 100 000 oz in 2012  The company has made good progress in its revitalization of the San Francisco mine  Expansion plans currently underway target a production level of 130 000 oz year  Improvements in throughput rates have raised monthly gold production  After a period of spending cash flow on capital development and mine optimization  Timmins is turning the corner and is expected to generate coveted free cash flow  For intermediate gold companies looking to grow and for investors looking to position themselves in real value  Timmins is also especially attractive  When we look at other junior developers that are attempting to build mines of the same scale as Timmins  San Francisco  it becomes very clear that Timmins is trading well below replacement value  TGR  What other companies do you like in Mexico  DG  On the development side I would be looking at Esperanza Resources Corp   EPZ TSX V   Esperanza looks like a good value in the junior gold space  Esperanza has the Cerro Jumil project  This time last year  Esperanza delivered a preliminary economic assessment  PEA  that called for just over 100 000 oz year of production  for an initial capex of approximately  114M to construct a heap leach operation mining 35 million tons  Mt   of material grading 0 83 g t gold  They ve achieved surface land and made submissions for water permits  At present gold prices  the Cerro Jumil project has an internal rate of return in excess of 50   Esperanza is expected to deliver a prefeasibility study shortly  along with a revision in resource expectations  I think that resource could see the project mine life expand from six years to upward of 10 years  and further define the ability to scale up the size of the annual production profile  Importantly  Esperanza also benefits from a new management team  The development  construction and operation team comes from Minefinders Corporation Ltd   which was recently taken over by Pan American Silver Corp   PAAS NASDAQ  PAA TSX   I m quite confident that Esperanza is going to be able to move the Cerro Jumil project from prefeasability to production  The Esperanza team is experienced in Mexico and is very experienced with this particular kind of ore body and with this type of process flow sheet  TGR  It also looks as if Esperanza has other projects in the pipeline  DG  Esperanza is doing regional exploration  When the time comes  there are both local and regional exploration targets that will be of interest  TGR  We ve spoken about four companies in Mexico on the development side and four on the production side  Which explorers or project generators in Mexico do you like  DG  Almaden Minerals Ltd   AMM TSX  AAU NYSE  is a very well disciplined  well managed project generator with a very good track record of making discoveries  and from either joint venturing or advancing them further  Its present flagship asset is the 100  owned Ixtaca property  which is a discovery Almaden made in August 2010  The original discovery hole was 300 meters of 1 g t gold and 48 g t silver  Almaden has four drills operating and has now drilled over 200 holes on the project  Mineralization has been traced for over a kilometer  and a parallel zone has been discovered  which has also been yielding some good results  Almaden is expected to publish its maiden resource in December  TGR  Almaden s Duane Poliquin invented the whole model of the resource generator  didn t he  DG  Almaden is a classic example of the project generation model  After 26 years in the exploration business  Almaden still has only 59 2M shares outstanding  Almaden has shown that it can fund the company through joint ventures and by monetizing assets and projects that have been developed and sold to other companies  TGR  Other than Mexico  what other countries do you particularly like in Latin America  DG  Nicaragua fits that description perfectly  although those taking a cursory glance might conclude otherwise  The operating experience of B2Gold Corp   BTO TSX  BGLPF OTCQX  in Nicaragua has been exceptionally good  It has no doubt benefited from the quality management team it brought to Nicaragua  But the country  through its government and permitting processes  has been refreshingly responsive to this junior gold company s needs  As a result  B2Gold has been successfully operating the Limon mine  a 40 000 oz year producer  The La Libertad mine was developed and is now a 100 000 oz year producer  Cash costs for B2Gold were  583 oz in the last quarter  The company has recently raised its production forecast  anticipating the development of what s called the Jabali zone  This zone exists in a 15  kilometer long corridor of prolific rocks that are host to some higher grade mineralization that will be put through the La Libertad Mill  TGR  Based on its success  is B2Gold more of an acquisitor or an acquisitee  DG  I think B2Gold is more of an acquisitor  It has exhibited the bench strength and the management capacity to operate a company three times its size  TGR  B2Gold has successfully negotiated and navigated the Latin American political waters  The fact that it can have such a successful project in Nicaragua suggests that it can also be successful in Peru  And perhaps it can be successful in other areas  like Argentina or maybe even Chile  DG  B2Gold s management has a long history in Chile  having formerly been with Bema Gold Corp   acquired by Kinross Gold Corp   K TSX  KGC NYSE   on the Cerro Casale project and others  TGR  Moving to a more macro discussion  do you see a general and continuing recovery in the precious metals equities  What other macro indicators  in your view  portend continued recovery of the space  DG  High levels of global  unsustainable debt continue to support the upward trend in gold prices  Unfunded debt impairs the ability of countries to grow and erodes confidence in currency  whether that currency is the euro or the U S  dollar or something else  All the moves by the various central banks to effectively print money through bond purchase programs to keep the yields and the interest rates low just further debase currency  Many smart observers in the marketplace have recognized that gold offers protection from those activities  As it becomes increasingly evident that central banks have no intention of stopping the printing of currency  gold should continue to rise again  This is a process that is not going to sort itself out in weeks or even in months  It s going to take years  While some of this pain is discounted in present valuations already  volatility will continue as the global central banks work their way out of this mess  TGR  What a great summary by which to end our conversation  What else would you like to add  DG  Perhaps more than any other time in the recent past  the Q2 12 reporting season has cleaned the slate with respect to disclosures among senior mining companies  intermediates and even junior companies  This fundamental reconciliation of the challenges gold companies have had with their associated assets paves the way for better news going forward as these challenges are overcome  The prospect of better news is what we re starting to see get discounted in share prices  hence the sector is in the early stages of moving higher  TGR  What new interest is there in the junior gold space from institutional investors  Considering that we have a cleanly set table  what different people are at the table than you ve seen before  DG  The past six months have brought a kind of cleansing process to institutional portfolios  The shares of companies that did not meet expectations and projects that did not evolve as hoped are being sold  And the resulting proceeds are being reinvested in some of the better companies that remain  It is those better companies that we see now leading the market higher in junior golds  TGR  Excellent  We and our readers value your comments   is PI Financial s director of institutional mining sales  where he focuses on the mining sector  Goguen s focus includes Select Golds advanced  exploration  emerging

158210,379726,PAAS,Pan American Silver s Acquisition Doesn t Add Up,opinion,As long term shareholders of Pan American Silver  who ve held it for more than a decade  we were surprised to hear that its management has decided to purchase Mine Finders    whose PE ratio is roughly twice that of PAAS s  We ve taken a closer look at the proposed financials and the deal does not add up On August 26  2011  PAAS shares were low enough that the company initiated a stock repurchase program for up to 5  of the stock  At the time it was stated that  in the opinion of its board of directors  the market price of its common shares  from time to time  may not fully reflect the underlying value of its mining operations  properties and future growth prospects   The price of PAAS closed that day at  31 72  It s rather dubious that a stock price  which was considered cheap at  31 72  is now considered well priced to use as buying collateral at  23  Typical  Doesn t ApplyGenerally  acquisitions are accretive when a company with a large cash balance uses it to purchase a profitable business in cash  or when a fair to highly priced company trading near the highs of its PE range uses its stock as collateral to purchase a business with a lower price and higher growth rate  In the case of PAAS buying MFN  neither of these conditions apply  PAAS has proposed to make a stock purchase using its shares with a PE in the 7 8 range of MFN whose PE is in the 15 16 range  Furthermore PAAS earnings are projected to grow faster than MFN Shareholders Will Suffer Immediate LossBased on the data above  we estimate that due to the proposed acquisition of MFN  PAAS shareholders will suffer an immediate loss of  1 11 per share for the cash payout  and an additional 15  dilution in earnings  We estimate that instead of trading at  23 18 today  PAAS would be trading at  27 77 implying a total dilutive loss of 20   It is worth noting that PAAS s massive Navidad project in Argentina is not currently priced into either the earnings projections or price of its stock  As a result  Navidad is an effective call option  which could potentially double the production from roughly 22 to 44 million ounces of silver per year  Since this isn t priced into the stock  the dilution of current shares could prove to be even more folly pending approval of Navidad by the Argentinean government At the end of 2011  Bill Fleckenstein resigned from the board  While we don t know the reason for sure  we now know that this directly preceded PAAS s dilutive bid of MFN  Perhaps Mr  Fleckenstein opposed the dilutive action It s difficult to buy and hold a stock  which is underpriced by the market  It s even more difficult to learn that management of the company attempts to justify the low price by diluting the company s value  We expect PAAS to underperform its peers going forward as it consolidates the dilutive loss The Real WinnersThe largest winners of this deal will be the management teams of PAAS and MFN  The largest losers will be PAAS shareholders  One year ago  MFN stock was trading in the  11 range and PAAS was above  40  Had they purchased MFN then  it would have been far less dilutive  Now  PAAS shareholders are paying almost twice the price for the same acquisition  We plan on voting against the acquisition  and would support an effort to replace current board management ,2012-09-30,TradePlacer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pan-american-silver's-acquisition-doesn't-add-up-138114,138114
158211,379727,PAAS,Profiting From Silver Mining In The Age Of Resource Nationalism  Sean Ra,opinion,Resource nationalism is becoming a growing problem for many mining companies  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Sean Rakhimov  editor of SilverStrategies com  shares his insights for safely investing in silver mining companies in a volatile world  The Gold Report  You have written that the pace of global resource nationalism is gaining momentum  affecting the supplies and prices of many commodities  You believe resource nationalism in all of its current forms is likely to affect silver more than other metals  particularly investable silver  Would you explain why  Sean Rakhimov  The effect of resource nationalism on the physical supply market has not been significant yet  but I do think it s going to affect future supply  Large scale projects like the Navidad in Argentina owned by Pan American Silver Corp   PAA TSX  PAAS NASDAQ   the Corani and Santa Ana projects in Peru owned by Bear Creek Mining Corp   BCM TSX V  and most recently the Malku Khota project in Bolivia owned by South American Silver Corp   SAC TSX  SOHAF OTCBB  are already affected  Combined  these projects represent about a billion and a half ounces that were expected to be coming on line at this time  Yet sales are nowhere on the horizon and it s largely due to the actions of the governments where these projects are located  TGR  If you had to take a guess at which one of those is least in jeopardy  which would you choose  SR  It s a bit of a toss up between Navidad and Corani  Navidad is higher grade and would likely bring more revenue to the government of Argentina  so the government may reconsider  On the flip side  Peru is largely a mining country  Mining makes up a large part of the economy compared to Argentina  These projects are so remote that I don t necessarily buy some of the arguments and reasoning why their development has been held up  These economies need additional money  Large scale projects such as the ones in question would generate thousands of jobs and bring hundreds of millions of dollars of investment  Logic would suggest that respective governments should soften their stance  yet Argentina is still going full tilt to the other side where it is not only tightening screws on mining but also is creating obstacles for any foreign business  TGR  Can we go back to your original thesis of how resource nationalism is going to affect investable silver  SR  Venezuela has been on that path of resource nationalism for the longest time  Ecuador is on that list as well as other countries  I think any new money coming into the sector will likely be diverted away from those countries  Look at Bolivia  for example  It has a number of operating mines  but it turned around and nationalized the exploration projects  TGR  Why did Bolivia nationalize South American Silver s silver project instead of a project that it could take over that doesn t need developing  SR  I don t have the definitive answer  Most likely it was a political decision to appease a certain constituency  In addition  the decision had a pragmatic element in that if you nationalize an operating mine  the implications in the international trade circles are further reaching and more negative  It could lead to some trade sanctions by other countries and so on  TGR  In an article entitled  Shrinking Silver Space  on SilverStrategies com  you argue that silver investors are largely limited to Mexico  Canada  the U S   Europe and to a lesser extent Australia  To the casual investor that seems like a fair number of choices  Isn t that enough  SR  It may be enough  but I think the underlying theme here is that perhaps it is advisable to avoid the jurisdictions we mentioned earlier  Their actions demonstrate that your money is at a greater risk if you re investing in those jurisdictions The key thing is that some monster projects located in risky jurisdictions are not coming on line and future silver supplies are going to be affected  Silver supply growth may not be there a few years from now  Right now the supply is growing about 3  a year  but I don t see a lot of big projects coming on line  The last big one that came on line was Penasquito  owned by Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE  in Mexico  And the next one is supposed to be the Escobar project in Guatemala  Lack of silver supply growth is going to be significant because the demand is increasing at a healthy pace  I liken this event in some respects to what s going to hit the uranium market at the end of this year when Russia stops its megatons to megawatts program  which would probably take away a good portion of the current uranium supply worldwide  Another event with similar implications is the mining labor unrest in South Africa  That affects the platinum and gold markets  but the major impact is squarely on the platinum market  These are major events for the sectors  TGR  Do you think the resource nationalism is going to result in a significant rise in silver prices  SR  Over time  yes  We re not going to get a billion and a half ounces of silver from the aforementioned projects in countries with unfriendly mining jurisdictions  That s one and one half years of annual worldwide supply  TGR  Do you think that we re ever going to get to what Eric Sprott is saying  that eventually silver will return to its historic 15 1 silver to gold price ratio  SR  I think it s in the cards at some time toward the end of the cycle  probably by the end of this decade  I don t have a more specific time frame  That s mainly because this cycle is different from a number of previous ones from recent history  this one is a worldwide crisis and we re talking about systemic problems with the global currencies  The four dominant currencies in the world the U S  dollar  euro  British pound and Japanese yen are shaky  We re talking about 80  or so of the currency market  This cycle has been going on for a long time  If this were an ordinary cycle  I think things would have been played out by now  We re about 10 years into it  TGR  Is this the beginning of a seismic shift  SR  Yes  this cycle is larger and more severe by an order of magnitude  and because of that it may take longer  There s a lot more at stake and a lot more powerful forces are involved  These forces will be much more active in trying to affect the outcome or timeline of events and they have already  TGR  One of the interesting features about SilverStrategies com is that you take some companies to task for things that you believe were not in the best interest of shareholders  One of your favorite targets is Hecla Mining Co   HL  and you suggest that it  successfully squandered its vast advantages over other silver companies when the current cycle began more than 10 year ago   But more recently Hecla has taken a different tack and it is borrowing its strategy essentially from a competitor and other larger companies in the precious metals space  Can you tell our readers about that  SR  Hecla used to be the household name when people thought about silver companies  But look at it today  It s trading at  1 7B market cap and probably a half dozen companies that either didn t exist or were half its size 10 years ago have outgrown it  Its management did not adjust when the boom times started  so today it doesn t have much of a growth pipeline  Take a look at its closest competitor  Coeur d Alene Mines Corp   CDM TSX  CDE NYSE   Both companies started in the Silver Valley in Idaho  Coming into the cycle both firms were established companies  roughly comparable peers  In that timeframe  Hecla didn t do much and has little to show for the last 10 years  But look at Coeur d Alene Mines  It went into Mexico and bought Palmarejo  one of the top 10 silver producing mines in the world  It also built mines in Bolivia and Argentina and extended its reach into Australia  Management completely reinvented the company  despite not being known as a risk taking company or at the cutting edge of anything coming into this cycle  It was an obscure company  but it certainly handled things better in this cycle than Hecla  No wonder that today it has about  1B more in market cap than Hecla  TGR  Hecla recently took a step to possibly develop its pipeline of projects  Tell us about that  SR  Hecla recently made a strategic investment in another junior company and that was a good move  The company is Dolly Varden Silver Corp   DV TSX   That project is in northern British Columbia and is a high grade underground past producing mine  It s a small mine but underground mines usually start small and then can grow to significant size  Hecla s familiar with that  It s the company s bread and butter  underground mining  It s good to see it making adjustments to the game plan here  It may be worth noting that Hecla also made a bid for U S  Silver Corp   which is in the Silver Valley  But it didn t happen despite Hecla offering a higher price than RX Gold   Silver Inc   RXE TSV V   the company that ultimately succeeded in the bidding  Dolly Varden has promise  The paths it is pursing geologically are very similar to Eskay Creek in terms of its origins  The hope is that the company will find deposits that are similar or comparable to Eskay Creek  Now that Hecla made that cash infusion  Dolly Varden has the funds to actually do some work on the ground  TGR  Some silver producers are generating significant cash flow as silver prices hover around  32 ounce  Are there producers that you are more fond of than others  SR  One producer I m very fond of is First Majestic Silver Corp   FR TSX  AG NYSE  FMV FSE   The company has grown throughout the cycle to become a very significant player  I think it will soon become a major in this space  certainly a growth company  It has been very aggressive in building the company  The company made a number of acquisitions and built mines  expanded them and has a very healthy pipeline of projects to grow the company and production  TGR  OK  What about another one  SR  Coeur D Alene would fall in that camp as well  though it s a major and that s not an area where I spend a lot of time  In the smaller companies  one of the companies I like a lot is SilverCrest Mines Inc   SVL TSX V  SVLC NYSE MKT   This is a company that I ve followed for a very long time and is another company that was victimized by resource nationalism  It had a major silver project in El Salvador years back  but the government wouldn t let the company develop it  So SilverCrest came to Mexico and got back to work  Since then it made a discovery  built a mine and that mine is now in production  SilverCrest is making about  3 million  M  a month at current metal prices  TGR  Do you think that that s fully priced into the stock  SR  That may be fully priced into the stock  That s hard to call mainly because the price of the metal moves and that changes the bottom line on a weekly basis  or what the bottom line would be based on that price  TGR  Are you getting the La Joya exploration potential for free with that  SR  Absolutely  I believe that the expansion of the Santa Elena mine to go underground and to build a mill is not priced in  Granted it is at least a year away for that expansion to come on line  but I believe the current plan is to finance that mill out of cash flow  I don t think the expansion is priced in because that would take them toward about 5 million ounce  Moz  silver production  on par with a company like Aurcana Corporation  AUN TSX V  AUNFF OTCQX  that is trading something like  400 600M in market cap  Another company in that range is Fortuna Silver Mines Inc   FSM NYSE  FVI TSX  FVI BVL  F4S FSE   although Fortuna has a base metal segment to it  There s certainly room for growing the valuation of SilverCrest based on that expansion and because the La Joya project is going to be very big  The company already has about a 100 Moz silver equivalent  the equivalent coming half from gold and half from copper  So 75  of value is in precious metals  between silver and gold  I believe it should come out with a new resource calculation sometime this year  which I expect to significantly increase the overall resource  I believe SilverCrest is getting no value for La Joya  which is common for producing companies  They get very little value for assets that are not in production once a company is valued on a cash flow basis  TGR  Are there any other producers you want to talk about  SR  There are two new ones that I am tracking closely  One is a company called Huldra Silver Inc   HDA TSX V   It will likely declare commercial production early in 2013  This is a high grade mine in British Columbia  TGR  What sort of production is the company looking at for its first year  SR  Something on the order of 2 Moz  This is a very good project and it s very high grade  There are other companies that are in the same group  One would be Excellon Resources Inc   EXN TSX   which has a mine in Mexico  Two other companies in the same category are Alexco Resource Corp   AXR TSX  AXU NYSE MKT   which is in Canada  and Silvercorp Metals Inc   SVM TSX  SVM NYSE   which operates mines in China  The reason I bring those three companies up is that they re all high grade underground silver lead zinc mines  Huldra would be another one whose ore grades are somewhere around 800 900 grams per ton  which is quite high for the industry  TGR  Why haven t investors heard of Huldra Silver  SR  It s a very young company  It started  or re started  in March 2010  and we haven t had the best resource markets since then  with the exception of that brief silver spike through  49 ounce  oz   It also has had a very tight share structure with not a lot of stakeholders  The new management team has done a good job  It came in and took things over  and in two and a half years the company went from a dormant project to one with over 100 employees  The mine is operating and the mill has been built and is running as we speak  Another impressive accomplishment is that the management got the mine permitted in British Columbia in a very short time  TGR  Do you think some of these midtier and larger silver producers will use some of their burgeoning cash flow to pick up some underpriced assets  SR  Absolutely  Usually the mergers and acquisitions in the sector happen in waves  often at the top or bottom of the market  We had an intermediate term top when gold hit  1 800 oz in spring 2011 and silver hit  49 oz  When the cycle is topping  large companies are usually flush with cash and they re looking to grow the company because that s the expectation from the market and investors to demonstrate future growth  Companies have two ways to spend it  dividends and growth buy somebody  increase production  Larger companies  balance sheets are in much better shape than exploration companies or junior companies  In addition  their valuations are higher  trading at several times better valuations than juniors  So these firms go for value and buy companies that are trading very cheaply  TGR  What are some companies that are trading very cheaply  Are there some potential takeover targets that you think might be enticing  SR  Merger and acquisition activity dovetails with what I have been saying about resource nationalism  A lot of capital has been flowing into Mexico and other  safe  jurisdictions  As far as takeover targets go  Global Minerals Ltd   CTG TSX V  DPF FSE   which is advancing a past producing silver project in Slovakia  could be a possibility  The project is growing and Europe doesn t have many large scale projects in the silver space  So Global is probably the next silver mine in Europe and it would be good acquisition target  The Mexican story that I like a lot is Santacruz Silver Mining Ltd   SCZ TSX V   It raised  20M at  0 90 share in April 2011 in a weak and declining market  In the initial public offering  IPO  the company did not offer any warrants  and yet it was fully subscribed  When was the last time you saw a junior exploration company do a  20M IPO  The company has done very well since  It is rapidly advancing one of its projects toward production  There are a lot of reasons to like this company  Santacruz has three projects and all are good grade with significant size potential  Santacruz is already building a mill at its first  smaller Rosario project  It plans to be in production within a year of the IPO and eventually to be producing 2 Moz year from this project  That s significant  The other two projects are larger and there aren t a lot of these types of projects to be had  There aren t a lot of producing mines with good grade and decent mine life  therefore  Santacruz s Gavilanes and San Felipe projects can potentially provide a growth pipeline  TGR  You once told us that you never sell silver bullion  but is now a good time to buy it  Or would you wait  SR  It s always a good time to buy silver  I don t do much timing as a trading strategy  I think you should be buying silver when you have excess cash  TGR  Is silver any closer to being purchased as a reserve currency by the world s central banks  as you once speculated it would be  SR  I think silver will be purchased at a point where gold is priced out of range for small central banks  The central banks are well aware of the gold silver ratio  which is around 50 1 now and should be going down  The trend is in that direction and  as I mentioned earlier  I expect it to hit 15 1  I m not sure how exactly it will play out  As discussed earlier  this is a much larger cycle than the last several  and a lot more is at stake here  And there will be a currency crisis  We re beginning to see governments around the world buying gold to add to their currency reserves and gold is still within central banks  price range  But if gold goes to  say   5 000 oz  as is routinely forecasted by many these days  are we going to see governments continue buying it as they do today  I don t know  Maybe they ll buy silver  maybe they ll buy palladium  But at some point I expect countries to buy silver because  in addition to being a precious metal  it is also a strategic metal like the rare earths or uranium  Silver is an important industrial commodity and countries that don t have any will have to either source it elsewhere including the open market or export manufacturing to some place where silver is available  TGR  Thanks for your time   launched his website    in 2004  His writing has appeared on such Internet portals as Le Metropole Cafe  24hGold  321gold  Kitco

158236,379752,PAAS,Follow The Money    Latin America Is The Place To Be,opinion,We are confident that Latin America will not only bring into production many new deposits in the following years  but that many new discoveries will be made as well  We follow the money as Latin America is apparently the place to be    Latin America continues to be the most popular destination for exploration investments in the world  According to the latest  World Exploration Trends  by the Metals Economics Group  25  of total exploration investments worldwide were headed to Latin America in 2011  in contrast to 10  in 2003   whereas 15  of all spending worldwide went to 3 countries  1  Mexico  6    2  Chile  5   and 3  Peru  4    More than  425 billion in investments have already been budgeted by international resource companies for the development of deposits in Latin America for the next 5 10 years  whereas the lion s share flows to Chile  Peru and Colombia Still  Unexplored Most near surface deposits in other regions of the world with traditional sound mining jurisdictions have already been discovered and are increasingly being depleted thanks to technological advances in exploration and mining since the 1970s  Many of the largest deposits worldwide are being brought into production in Latin America these days  yet Latin America is still considered as being relatively underexplored  because its laws were not favorable for foreign companies in the past  During the last decade  a drastic change in politics and attitude toward foreign mining companies has occurred in Latin America with the result that most exploration funds are now flowing there continuously  Peru  Chile and Mexico rank among the three mining friendliest countries in Latin America  according to the Fraser Institute  and the Top 10 in the world  While the frameworks and jurisdictions for exploration and mining are worsening in many other regions  e g  Australia or China   Latin America is increasingly improving its regulations  Peru is ranked third in the world in terms of gold  silver  copper and zinc reserves  yet from a mining standpoint  only 15  of the country has been explored leaving immense potential for future discoveries  Already  Peru has experienced 10 years of consecutive economic growth and ranks as one of the fastest growing economies in the world  in 2006 2009  GDP grew on average 9  per year  in hand with one of the lowest inflation rates in Latin America  This is mainly due to Peru being the largest silver producer in the world  the third largest in copper and zinc  the fourth largest in lead and the sixth largest gold miner  The government looks favourably on foreign mining investments as a method of helping to finance the countrys development  The credit rating agencies Standard   Poors  DBRS  Moodys and Fitch have all given the country  Investment Grade  status  In 2009  mineral exports made up 61  of export revenue  Peru has signed Free Trade Agreements with China  Canada  USA and other countries and has executed more than 30 international investor agreements which effectively protect investors Peru Does MiningIn no other Latin American country does mining represent the main engine of the economy as is the case with Peru  Exports from the mining sector total some  30 billion  out of which around  10 billion is earned from gold and  7 billion from silver exports  With an output of 170 tons in 2010  Peru ranks as the worlds sixth largest gold producer  Illegal mining accounts for around 25  of that output  with a strong tendency that it will shift to foreign companies as mining regulations are increasingly tightened by the Peruvian government  for the benefit of sound regulated mining   The third largest gold producer  USA  mined 210 tons in 2010  whereas  2 Australia had an output of 255 tons and China 345 tons    which translates into Peru having a realistic chance of ranking among the 3 largest gold producers in the near future as a production increase of around 25  is solely required to achieve this  The map from Infomine com shows major mines in Peru with Yanacocha in the northern Andes being one of the largest and most profitable gold mines in the world  with varying amounts of silver   The Yanacocha district is a 10 x 4 km area of altered rocks within an extensive belt of Tertiary volcanics that extends the whole length of Peru and which also hosts the epithermal gold deposits Lagunas Norte and Pierna    The recent violent protests by anti mining groups lead to the Peruvian government stepping in rigorously  which shows how pro mining politics are increasingly turning these days and even radically enforceing the development of new mines as they know how beneficial foreign investments really are  mining already accounts for 61  of its economy  whereas fresh foreign investments of some  50 billion stand ready today for the development of only a few large deposits during the next years      Perus government declared a 30 day state of emergency on Monday night after two people were killed and dozens of police officers injured in violent anti mining protests against Swiss based Xstrata near Cuzco  in south eastern Peru  The protesters  reports local paper El Comercio  accuse the Tintaya copper mine  owned by the world s fourth largest copper producer Xstrata  of polluting local water supplies and killing farm animals  Peru s president of the cabinet  Oscar Vald s  said in an official statement the government was urgently seeking to restore dialogue  These protesters are very radical and opposed to dialogue and so to ensure safety we are declaring a state of emergency  he said  Until negotiations are restored  Peru s army and security forces will have special powers to quell protests and clear roadblocks that have cut off the mine  Reuters reported shortly thereafter   Thousands of Peruvians marched in support of the countrys biggest ever mining project yesterday  a day after the government implemented emergency powers to control an anti mining protest in the south that turned deadly  The rally in the northern region of Cajamarca in favour of Newmont Minings  4 8 billion Conga project praised the economic benefits of mining  a contrast to demonstrations in Cusco against Xstratas Tintaya mine in which two people were killed  Conga has gold deposits worth about  15 billionat current prices and would be the biggest investment ever in Peru mining  It is a crucial test for newly installed Humala who has on many occasions publicly backed the project  Royalties and taxes to the government from Conga  which would also produce copper  could total  800 million per year and operation was scheduled to start in 2014    Foreign resource companies not only make possible the export of a country s resources to global markets  but also the import of money  technologies and know how creating new industries  infrastructure  incomes  jobs  qualified work forces and taxes  If the people of a country feel they are not participating in that knowledge and wealth creation  then they must pressure the government and not foreign mining companies as the latter are just doing what they are allowed to do as per the framework set by the respective government   The MinersOther senior mining companies with operations in Peru include Barrick  BHP Billiton  Rio Tinto  Xstrata  Pan American Silver  First Quantum  Rio Alto  Hudbay  Candente Copper and Chinese state owned Chinalco  While it is typically the large mining projects that traditionally face heavy protests by anti mining groups  smaller projects normally go through the stages from exploration to production smoothly and without much public notice  Since Peru is so rich in minerals  there are many thousand of small illegal mines producing for example  40 tons of gold per year  This is possible mainly due to the geological characteristics of hydrothermal gold and silver deposits which are typically a few meters wide with high grade veins running for some hundred meters near the surface making possible low cost underground mining using adits a few meters wide to follow the veins  If the veins are sufficiently enriched with gold and or silver  a mining operation can start rather quickly as immediate cash flow is generated by the very first meters in following the veins which enables company to re invest that cash flow into further low cost exploration and infrastructure on site Silvercorp Metals Inc   TSX    started  financing  its mining operations exactly like that and is today one of the worlds most profitable silver mines  As it is rather unlikely to find another such large silver deposit in the world today as Silvercorp did some 10 years ago  there exist hundreds of smaller  less complex and less costly deposits especially in Latin America that would enable a  private or public  company to start production relatively fast within a few months after discovery and initial resource calculation  In such cases  no year long and multi million dollar drill campaigns and feasibility studies must be undertaken as the mining operation is to be classified as a small mining operation generating cash flow of some 10s million dollar per year for a couple of years with only small and low cost infrastructure required on site    One of the exploration companies we follow closely is Sunset Cove Mining Corp   TSX    which was founded in 2008 by Lorne Woods and Marc Blais  We know Woods from the elephant sized success story of Osisko Mining Corp   TSX     which discovered  10 million gold ounces in Canada and is now worth   3 billion  We also follow Woods  because he regularly writes good readable articles in his blog about global economies  stock markets  resource stocks and countries like Peru  where he  as the CEO   President of SSM  manages the development of some high grade near surface silver veins into a small mine within a relatively short time  Together with Blais  both have 35 years of experience in managing mining operations and in financing public companies  As we know them from Osisko times  we also know them as having access to a handpicked international network of private and institutional investors  banks and brokers  During the last few years  they have installed an uniquely experienced Peruvian team consisting of a Mining Engineer  a Mining Geologist and a well established General Manager all of whom have extensive experience in working with international and Peruvian mining companies  Together  they have access to a crucial network rich in local knowledge and experience in bringing deposits into production without much hassle  Base MetalsCurrently  its flagship is the Carolay polymetallic silver property  where advanced exploration drilling is taking place during 2012  The mineralization found on Carolay and the adjacent Mara on sector fits into the model of hydrothermal polymetallic and feeder vein systems with  mantos   metasomatic replacement zones rich in base metals like zinc  lead  gold  silver and copper  and is similar to that found in the highly prolific Coeur DAlene silver district in Idaho  which historically has produced more silver than any other silver district in the USA The company s NI43 101 Technical Report for Carolay  which now totals 5 784 ha  demonstrates a mineable grade of 269 g t silver  A new vein  Carolay 4  has recently been discovered and surface samples taken from its 13 meter length show 352 g t silver  whereas one sample returned 4 674 g t silver  There are also indications of a disseminated copper ore body on the property  potentially porphyry style  Porphyry deposits are the single largest source of copper in the world and can also be major sources of silver and gold During 2012  SSM intends to focus on its flagship Carolay property by continuing its core drilling campaign of around  6 000 meters until the end of the year and completing an updated NI43 101 Technical Report to accomplish two objectives  1  To prepare the first Carolay resource calculation  2  To begin exploring the recently acquired Humberto and Mara on sectors  which were acquired in late 2011 and have more than doubled the property to 5 784 ha  Surface sampling has been positive and both are ready to be explored by drilling to reveal their potential  Additionally  the highly prospective Carolay 4 vein will be more thoroughly developed All of SSMs properties are located near existing significant mining or exploration projects  The company is not only publicly traded on the Toronto Exchange  TSX V  SSM   but also on the Bolsa de Valores de Lima in Peru  BVL  SSM   SSM is headquartered in Toronto  Ontario  with an office in Montreal  The companys wholly owned Peruvian subsidiary is based in Lima  Minera Sunset Del Peru SAC  Former  Artisanal  Mining SitesCarolay is located near the village of Ushnobal in La Libertad  Low volume artisanal silver mining had taken place at Carolay during the 1870s  The previous titleholder had insufficient capital to fund further exploration  After a thorough evaluation process and negotiations  SSM took possession of the property Located 550 km NNW of Lima  the regional geography at Carolay is made up by Precambrian aged metamorphic rocks of the Maranon Metamorphic Complex famous both for its rich mineralization and its potential for discoveries  It is co magmatic with the Pataz Batholith located within the gold and silver Pataz mining district  Both geological formations   Maranon and Pataz   stem from the same magma flow  Carolay is located on the fringes of the Pataz Batholith  The productive Pataz Mining Belt is internationally known for its rich gold and silver deposits  According to the Geological  Mining   Metallurgical Institute of Peru  6 million gold ounces have been produced in the Pataz  Parcoy and Buldibuyo mining districts from 16 mines over the last 100 years  Nearby and around the Carolay property there are blocks of claims held by Minera Aurifera Retamas and Consorcio Minero Horizonte  These Peruvian mining companies operate well known precious metals deposits in the general area of the Mara on Fault  a well known metallotect  Several claim holders are present immediately south and contiguous to Carolay  Within a 50 km radius  the important gold and silver producers Poderosa  Mara on  Retamas and Horizonte operate producing mines  The same geological features found in these precious metal production zones can be found at Carolay  whereas the topographic  tectonic and petrographic setting is similar Economic grades of silver have been found in the samples taken for the NI43 101 report on Carolay  such as 269 g t silver  0 9  zinc  0 8  lead  and 0 3  copper  The mineralization found on the Carolay property and the adjacent Mara on sector fits into the model of polymetallic and feeder veins and is similar to that found in the Coeur DAlene silver district  On May 30  SSM released the assays from the first drill hole intersecting a high grade vein with 151 g t silver for almost half a meter  Further assays from the ongoing drill program will be released any time now plus providing the stock with a regular news flow potentially confirming the extension of such veins and discovering new zones of high grade mineralization   SSMs ability to find and acquire properties like Carolay stems from the network it has established in Peru through decades of working in country and through the relationships that its Peruvian staff have made after a combined 48 years working for major Peruvian and multinational companies  This ability provides the company with an advantage that few others can meet Disclaimer The above editorial is not to be construed as

158237,379753,PAAS,Henk Krasenberg   Equities The Way To Benefit From Gold s Strength  ,opinion,Henk J  Krasenberg  analyst and founder of the European Gold Centre and author and publisher of the GOLDVIEW newsletter  sees no lack of potential among small cap equities  especially for investors willing to look beyond the U S  borders  He offers names in Europe and Africa what he calls  the poorest and richest continent  and reminds us that Mexico produces a lot more than silver  In this exclusive Gold Report interview  Krasenberg counsels patience because  you have to wait for the development     The Gold Report  Henk  what did you make of the June 17 Greek election  What does the country s apparent decision to stay in the Eurozone say about the sustainability of the European Union  EU     Henk Krasenberg  I am happy with the result because it shows that common sense prevailed  It seems that Greece will do everything to stay in the EU  Also  it prevented immediate chaos in the European markets    Of course  it does not mean all the problems are over  but the immediate threat of a chain reaction in Spain  Portugal and Italy is gone for the time being  I don t think the Eurozone will fall apart  It would be awkward for us all to go back to our own currencies again  I am confident that the EU and the euro will stay    TGR  Do you think the average European retail investor is as concerned about European debt problems as investors in North America    HK  I do not think the European retail investor is really a party  In general  European private investors are pretty quiet and not so spontaneous in their investment reactions    What is more important is the attitude and investment behavior of the institutions  They are concerned about European and American debt  In general  we are confident that the EU  the European central banks and the International Monetary Fund will come up with solutions  although most of those solutions are political    TGR  The interest rate on Spain s 10 year Treasuries is now 7  and its economic growth is less than 1   How does that affect the stability of the EU    HK  Interest rates are important for governments  institutions and corporations  but not so much for investors  I remember a prominent Dutch investment manager saying 20 years ago   I only talk about interest rates when I m drunk   I have always remembered that    People cannot influence interest rates  They are beyond our reach  We can look at interest rates  we can comment on them  but someone else is deciding what will happen    TGR  In the past  you have said the real problem with the global economy is that the U S  refuses to admit that it is bankrupt  Yet  over the last two years  U S  markets have outperformed European markets by nearly 40   How do you argue against that    HK  If you are big enough  you usually do not go bankrupt  So  the U S  will not go bankrupt  But if you look at its financial situation  it is in fact bankrupt  If it were to really fail  the impact would be too severe  so it will be saved    The Federal Reserve is handling the situation quite well  manipulating a lot of things  including gold  And I think the Fed is doing everything to hide the real situation    I think there is excessive optimism in the American markets  and I think the pessimism in the European markets is an overreaction    TGR  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke announced a continuation of the Twist program  basically an exchange of short term debt for long term debt  What do you make of that    HK  Bernanke is in a terrible position  The Fed will not make any statement that would really hurt itself or change things overnight  If you change short term debt for long term debt  it is only delaying the execution  Sooner or later  you have to admit that you cannot pay your debts    TGR  You like gold because you believe it will hold its purchasing power over time  but you like small cap gold equities because they offer what you call flexibility  What do you mean by that    HK  I like gold  but it is too static  When you own gold  you sit there and wait  Only very sophisticated investors sell and buy or steer with instruments like options or futures    With mining shares  you can be much more flexible  You can keep your commitment to the metal  but you can adjust your holdings as things change within the companies  within the industry  with the preference of metal and with the performance of metal prices  Eventually  if you play your cards right  equities should be a better way to benefit from the underlying strengths of the metals    TGR  Over the last 18 months investors would have been a lot better off holding their money in  static  gold versus gold equities    HK  People get impatient  The mining and exploration companies are longer term plays  You have to wait for the development  Some of those companies are grossly undervalued while they are doing great  Sooner or later  the market will have to correct itself    TGR  When will that happen    HK  That is difficult to say  Internationally  only 2  of people s money has been invested in gold and mining shares  I expect that to increase in due time  We are waiting for institutions to make a shift  But before that happens  the industry has to make some changes  too    When mining and exploration companies come to Europe to present themselves to the investment community  the most often heard reaction is that they are so small  Professional European investors cannot look at a company with a market cap of  10 million  M  or less  I expect there will be many more mergers in the next 12 months because we need bigger entities in the market  Pension funds are starting to nibble now  but they would like to see more larger companies    TGR  Is that not related to the amount of risk a fund is allowed to own    HK  Perhaps  but it is also the practical response of big investment fund managers who are mostly managing very large portfolios  too large to spend time and effort to look at all those small companies    That is why the exchange traded funds  ETFs  and mining investment funds are growing  It would be ideal if the European pension funds and other institutions would take part in these funds to get them more comfortable with the industry    Up until now  there is only a relatively small group of European institutions that buy mining shares  and you really have to look for them  That is what I try to do with my publications  to find the metals  and mining receptive people in the institutions    TGR  There are hundreds of companies seeking economic metals and mineral deposits in Europe  What do North American retail investors need to know about investing in Europe    HK  The general thing I would like to say to American investors is that the world is a lot larger than your own country  Asia  Australia  Africa  Europe and Latin America all offer great opportunities  Canada and Mexico are in your backyard  and there are opportunities there  You do not need to invest in Europe  If you do  great  but it is not a priority    TGR  What are some of your favorite European mining plays    HK  Sweden is the most active country here in Europe  Historically  it had a lot of zinc and iron mining  but nowadays its mining and exploration of many more metals are all over the place  Sweden has some nice producing gold mines  Nordic Mines AB  NOMI ST  NOM OSLO  and Gold Ore Resources Ltd   GOZ V   for example    In other metals  Northland Resources Inc   NAU TO  is constructing one of the world s largest iron mines  Tasman Metals Ltd   TSM V  TAS NYSE  has built a great portfolio of rare earth element metals and will do remarkably well  Mawson Resources Ltd   MAW TO  originally built an extensive position in uranium but has recently reorganized the company and its holdings  Its flagship is now in gold uranium in Finland    Spain and Portugal have long mining histories  primarily in coal  However  the EU wants to stop coal mining  Several companies are now exploring and some are moving closer to mining in both countries  Spain and Portugal have good potential and an experienced labor force waiting  exploration activities have increased and will be directed to gold  tungsten  copper and zinc    Astur Gold Corp   AST V  acquired a former gold producer and is now in the permitting stage  Because it is located just a few hundred meters from the coast  the company had to change the infrastructure to dewater the mine to avoid pollution  The Spanish and local governments are very cooperative and laborers are waiting to be employed    Also in Spain  I like Ormonde Mining Plc  ORM L  and Edgewater Exploration Ltd   EDW V   Edgewater is also active in Ghana in Africa  It just announced that it commissioned a finance firm to raise  120M to put its Spanish project into production    TGR  Are the Spanish and Portuguese governments more likely to fast track these operations to spur economic development    HK  At an EU minerals conference two years ago  the Spanish Minister of the Economy said the government would do everything to accommodate the resource industry  the provincial governments in Spain also have a good attitude toward more mining and exploration    Portugal recently opened up new tenders for additional licenses and has been awarding them  Avrupa Minerals Ltd   AVU V  just acquired some of these new Portuguese licenses  Avrupa is the Turkish word for Europe  But that is the only Turkish thing about the company  apart from the president s 15 years as a geologist there  He is looking for gold  tungsten  zinc and copper  Colt Resources Inc   GTP V  is also in Portugal with gold and tungsten projects    TGR  You note in your newsletter that European investors are more likely to invest in African metals plays  Is the reason as simple as proximity    HK  That depends on your definition of proximity  Not as a matter of geographic proximity  no  But Europeans have a background in Africa  Colonialism is not the proudest part of our history  but it must be recognized  As a result  Europeans have more direct experience with Africa  Americans have no ties there  thus there is very little sentiment toward investing in Africa    TGR  Which African countries do you like    HK  Most people look at the historical gold areas in South Africa and Ghana  Both are solid gold producers  Several exploration projects in Ghana are close to resuming production  Other historically important countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC  with gold  copper  diamonds and important strategic metals such as coltan  and Zambia with its famous copper belt    Newer mining countries like Tanzania  Burkina Faso and Mali  now ridden with political troubles  and lesser known Eritrea  Ethiopia and Mauritania are interesting  Also in East Africa the interest in natural resources is moving forward    I always say Africa is known as the poorest continent but it is also the richest continent on earth  It has resources everywhere  but still remains largely underexplored  There is great potential    TGR  Which African companies do you like    HK  In the production sector  I adore SEMAFO Inc   SMF TO   It has producing mines in Burkina Faso  Niger and Guinea  It has first class management and social programs to be proud of    I used to like Etruscan Resources Inc   EET TO   which was taken over by Endeavour Mining Corp   EDV TO  EVR ASX   The company solved some problems and now has two producing gold mines in Ghana and Burkina Faso and a great portfolio of properties    Of course  African Barrick Gold Plc  ABG L  is by far the best choice you can have  I also like Randgold Resources Ltd   GOLD NASDAQ  RRS L   a company with four producing mines in Mali and C te d Ivoire  it is developing a big mine in the DRC  as well as several advanced exploration projects in Mali  C te d Ivoire  Burkina Faso and Senegal    Also  Toronto based New Dawn Mining Corp   ND TO  is steadily producing gold in Zimbabwe  a most difficult country  and is worth mentioning    Tanzania is perhaps the most promising country for exploration  Tembo Gold Corp   TEM V  is well organized  Its management is highly experienced in Tanzania and has worked with Barrick  The local office is dealing with the local infrastructure  the project and the exploration site  Everything else is done from Toronto  That is an impressive corporate structure  and I feel comfortable with David Scott as CEO    TGR  Tembo has a property next to African Barrick s Bulyanhulu mine  If Tembo outlines a significant resource  will it become a takeover target    HK  There is that possibility  but Tembo s management may not be eager to do that  First  a lot of development work remains to be done  If anyone has a chance to know what the territory could bring  it is the people at Tembo    TGR  African Barrick has had issues in Tanzania with local artisanal miners  Has that been a problem for Tembo    HK  I do not think so  although artisanal mining is a problem all over Africa  There are two ways to deal with it  You can scare them off  That means complicated situations  which turn local forces against you  Or you can work with the artisanal miners  Artisanal mining is not a threat  it only goes 5 or 10 meters deep  Companies should turn the negative into a positive and use the artisanal miners as an extension of their own exploration forces    In Ghana  African Gold Group Inc   AGG V  reached an agreement with the artisanal miners  While making it clear that the property belongs to the company  the agreement gave the artisanal miners a part of the property where the company would not explore for the time being  It said  go ahead  everything you find is yours with one obligation tell us what you find  We will not take it  but we want to know  That is how to handle artisanal miners    TGR  Tembo also has the backing of major financial institutions  How important is that    HK  A few intelligent young guys are behind Tembo  They have a very good rapport with financiers and they know where to get money  This makes David Scott very happy because he can focus on his skill  advancing the property    TGR  Any other African names    HK  In Tanzania  I like Helio Resource Corp   HRC V   a Vancouver company  It also is exploring gold properties in Namibia  These companies complete my list  Nevsun Resources Ltd   NSU TO  and Sunridge Gold Corp   SGC V  in Eritrea and Stratex International Plc  STI L  in Ethiopia and Djibouti    TGR  Your supporters include a number of companies operating in Mexico  Tell us about them    HK  Mexico is a priority country for mining and exploration and is generally mining friendly  But in the past  it was difficult to acquire large pieces of land  Only in the last 10 years has the industry has really materialized  Companies like Great Panther Silver Ltd   GPR TO  GPL NYSE   Excellon Resources Inc   EXN TO   Minefinders Corp   MFL TO  MFN NYSE   recently taken over by Pan American Silver Corp   PAAS TO  PAAS NASDAQ    AuRico Gold Inc   AUQ TO  AUQ NYSE   Endeavour Silver Corp   EDR TO  EXK NYSE   First Majestic Silver Corp   FR TO  AG NYSE  and SilverCrest Mines Inc   SVL V  all have moved from exploration to successful production over the last few years and will continue to do well    I also like Aurcana Corporation  AUN V   which is increasing capacity at its La Negra mine  Scorpio Mining Corp   SPM TO   which has been kind of quiet  and Avino Silver   Gold Mines Ltd   ASM V  ASM NYSE   a silver producer in the past that is now restarting production    In the exploration sector  MAG Silver Corp   MAG TO  MVG NYSE  is a very good one to mention  it will probably be one of the next producers    I have followed Canasil Resources Inc   CLZ V  for a long time  Its president  Bahman Yamini  is an intelligent mining operator and explorer  but people have not recognized the promise of his project base  Canasil is a great takeover candidate  although Yamini is a shrewd negotiator  an acquirer will have to pay the price    Newer companies include Riverside Resources Inc   RRI TO   Revolution Resources Corp   RV TO  and El Tigre Silver Corp   ELS V   It is not hard to find good candidates    But Mexico is not only about silver  it also has other metals such as gold  copper and zinc  As a gold producer  I like Timmins Gold Corp   TMM V  TGD NYSE   It brought its San Francisco mine into production in a relatively short time and has good potential to grow    TGR  Aurcana is developing a silver mine in Texas  where uranium mines have also come into production  What do you think of Texas as a viable mining jurisdiction    HK  When I saw Aurcana s presentation in Geneva just a month ago  I was very surprised to learn about silver mining in Texas  Hearing Lenic Rodriguez talk about the Shafter mine  I did some homework and discovered it is situated in an historical silver mining area    There is a kind of revival of U S  mining and exploration  And it is not just Texas  Developments are taking place in Montana  Idaho  the Carolinas and Arizona  I even heard one company talking about exploring in Washington state    TGR  Is that due to the economy    HK  In part  but more broadly  people recognize that the resource industry is not just a short term play  They recognize the world will continue to need metals and that metal prices offer viable opportunities  Aurcana  for example  can produce silver at  7 8 oz and sell it at  28 oz  What other business has profit margins like that  Other industries are looking at eroding end prices  but not the resource industry  I think that is behind this revival of mining in America    TGR  Henk  thank you for your time and insights     is the founder of the   which analyzes and comments on gold  other metals and minerals and international mining and exploration companies

158238,379754,PAAS,Traders Would Not Expect These ETFs To Carry Political Risks,opinion,Stemming from a lack of cross border diversification  country specific ETFs expose investors to some level of political risk  This holds particularly true in emerging and frontier markets    For example  the primary reason for the Global X FTSE Argentina 20 ETF s  NYSE  ARGT  year to date loss of almost 21 percent is likely the country s growing reputation for hostility towards foreign companies looking to do business there    However  political volatility does not begin and end with country or regional ETFs  As Argentina and a number of other countries have shown in 2012  some sector funds also expose investors to significant political uncertainty  Below are four of these politically sensitive sector funds    Market Vectors Coal ETF  NYSE  KOL  In regards to politics  the Market Vectors Coal ETF is a curious case because its political issues stem from the US government  rather than less stable emerging nation governments  In the US  2012 is an election year and major coal producing states such as Pennsylvania and West Virginia are viewed as swing states  That means President Obama and Mitt Romney may tell coal miners what they want to hear in an effort to gain their support    Talk is cheap  So is natural gas  To this end  natural gas  an abundant commodity in the U S   burns more cheaply than coal  Natural gas has political momentum  but it does not mean death for KOL and its constituents  This political momentum may mean  however  that U S  coal companies will become more dependent on exports to emerging markets as profit drivers  Granted  that shift might only be possible if Chinese and Indian economies hit on all cylinders   a premise that is not currently occurring    Global X Silver Miners ETF  NYSE  SIL  Approximately two thirds of SIL s country weight goes to companies based in Canada  the U K  and the U S  As a result  the home docile of many of SIL s holdings may not be a source of significant political instability  Instead  silver miners may face political instability where they go to extract the white metal    A generous assessment says three of the top 10 silver producing countries are politically risky  That trio is Russia  Bolivia and Argentina  though some would argue and Peru and China belong are politically volatile as well  Within the list of the top 20 silver producing nations  at least five others could be considered less than trustworthy at the political level    Pan American Silver  NASDAQ  PAAS   SIL s fourth largest holding  is facing some political headwinds in Argentina  This news highlights common risks involved with the production of precious metals    ETFS Physical Palladium Shares  NYSE  PALL  Russia and South Africa dominate global palladium production  In 2009  the pair produced 85 percent of the world s palladium  Each nation presents investors with a different set of political challenges    Of the palladium duo  Russia may be the more concerning  The country s palladium export data could be questionable  This forces many market participants to analyze Swiss customs data  Switzerland is a major hub for precious metals trading in Europe    Beyond that  Russia may not be forthright regarding its palladium stockpiles  Assuming Russia has larger stockpiles than traders believe it has  the country could flood the market if palladium prices surge  Or  Russia may not want others to know if its palladium stocks are quite low  The country might withhold this information because its release would likely lead to a sudden jump in prices    Both scenarios are speculation  but Russia s secretive nature regarding its palladium reserves only increases palladium price

158240,379756,PAAS,A Closer Look At Suburban Propane Partners  Distributable Cash Flow ,opinion,Suburban Propane Partners  SPH  markets and distributes fuel oil  kerosene  diesel fuel and gasoline to residential and commercial customers  and is now the third largest retail marketer of propane in the United States  measured by retail gallons sold On August 1  2012  Suburban Propane Partners consummated its acquisition of the retail propane business of Inergy L P   NRGY  in exchange for consideration of   1 8 billion consisting of  i   1 billion in newly issued notes   ii   184 8 million in cash to NRGY note holders  and  iii   590 million of new SPH units distributed to NRGY  all but  5 9 million of which will subsequently be distributed by NRGY to its unit holders  The notes and cash were issued and paid to holders of   1 2 billion NRGY notes  In addition  SPH paid   65 million to these note holders as a consent payment SPH typically sells   2 3 of its retail propane volume and   3 4 of its retail fuel oil volume during the peak heating season of October through March  In an article dated 4 21 12  I noted that fiscal 2012 will not look good compared to fiscal 2011  Indeed  a review of the first 9 months of the fiscal year illustrates the difficult business environment faced by SPH  Retail propane gallons sold in third fiscal quarter ended 6 30 12  3Q FY2012  decreased   5 6 million gallons  or 10 3   to 49 0 million gallons compared to 54 6 million gallons in the prior year third quarter  Sales of fuel oil and other refined fuels decreased approximately 1 3 million gallons  or 23 2   to 4 3 million gallons during the third quarter of fiscal 2012  compared to 5 6 million gallons in the prior year third quarter The most significant factor cited by management as impacting volumes in both segments during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was a near record warm April 2012  which added to the effects of a record warm second quarter of fiscal 2012  across the SPH s service territories  SPH has maintained its distribution per unit at  3 41   0 8525 per quarter  for the last 9 consecutive quarters despite deteriorating business fundamentals  At 8 5   SPH offers an enticing distribution yield  However  investors should review SPH s results of operations as of its third fiscal quarter ended 6 30 12  3Q FY2012  and the implications of SPH s  1 8 billion acquisition of NRGY s propane business consummated on 8 1 12  in an attempt to ascertain whether the distribution is sustainable  Distributable cash flow   DCF   is a quantitative standard viewed by investors  analysts and the general partners of many master limited partnerships   MLPs   as an indicator of the MLP s ability to generate cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in quarterly distribution rates  Since DCF is not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles   GAAP   measure  its definition is not standardized In fact  as shown in a   each MLP may define DCF differently  SPH does not define DCF at all and the only non GAAP measure it reports is adjusted EBITDA  A review of its cash flows and the sustainability of its distributions can still be performed  albeit without a comparison to reported DCF  Given quarterly fluctuations in revenues  working capital needs and other items  it makes sense to review trailing 12 months   TTM   numbers rather than quarterly numbers for the purpose of ascertaining whether distributions are sustainable DCF and whether they were funded by additional debt  by issuing additional units or other sources of cash that I consider non sustainable  A good starting would be to compare sustainable cash flow to partnership distributions  Table 2 indicates that for the TTM ending 6 30 12 sustainable DCF fell significantly short of covering distributions  The gap has not been filled by issuing debt or equity  but rather by reducing cash reserves  This can be seen from a simplified cash flow statement in Table 3 below As of 6 30 12 SPH s balance sheet was strong with equity capital at  896 million  down from  976 million in the prior year  and long term debt only at  348 million  unchanged from a year ago   The EBITDA multiple for the TTM ending 6 30 12 was conservative 3 4x  There were no intangible assets to speak of The acquisition of NRGY s retail propane business was consummated after the end of the fiscal quarter and its results of operation are not reflected in Tables 1 3  They are provided in a pro forma statement issued 8 6 12 and indicate deteriorating margins  operating income and net income The reason the interest expense in Table 4 is so low is that the   1 billion of debt assumed by SHP is not on the balance sheet of Inergy Propane  so the interest expense does not appear on the income statement  Adding depreciation and amortization to operating income for the 9 months period ending 6 30 12 gives us   150 million of operating cash flow  From this we should deduct maintenance capital expenditures  say  8 million   interest expense on  1 billion of debt for 9 months  say  57 million   leaving   85 million The  590 million worth of SPH units will require distributions of   38 million  on a 9 month basis   so there should be an excess of   47 million   63 million annualized  which makes the deal accretive for SPH unit holders  If  in addition  SPH can extract operating efficiencies from the combined businesses  sustainable DCF may cover distributions  With the units trading at around  40  this may be an opportune time to establish or increase a position in SPH Unlike some of the other MLPs I have covered  including for example  El Paso Pipeline Partners  EPB   Enterprise Products Partners  EPD   Magellan Midstream Partners  MMP   Targa Resources Partners  NGLS   Plains All American Pipeline  PAA   and Williams Partners  WPZ   I don t see much potential for growth in distributions  However  the yield is already at 8 5  and if the coverage ratio improves there is the possibility for some capital appreciation ,2012-08-08,Ron

158241,379757,PAAS,A Closer Look At Buckeye Partners  Distributable Cash Flow As Of 2Q 2012,opinion,On August 3  2012  Buckeye Partners L P   BPL  reported results of operations for 2Q 2012  Revenues  operating income  net income and earnings before interest  depreciation   amortization and income tax expenses  EBITDA  were as follows The decrease in net income primarily reflects a gain of  34 1 million on the sale of a minority equity interest in West Texas LPG Pipeline Limited Partnership recorded in 2Q11  Lower revenues in 2Q12 and 1H12 are primarily attributable to BPL s Energy Services   BES   business  a wholesale distributor of refined petroleum products in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States  Basis volatility and continued market backwardation  see   negatively impacted the value of its inventory and its sales margin  BES segment revenues in 2Q12 and 1H12 declined by  117 3 million and  138 million  respectively  compared to the similar prior year periods  BES  EBITDA dropped significantly  as can be seen in Table 2 below Flat or declining operating performance over the past 6 quarters is also evident from Table 3 below  I discussed the problems facing BPL and its investors several times over the last few months  see   another   and a third   After 32 consecutive quarterly increases in distributions per unit  the 1Q12 amount declared on May 4  2012  was  1 0375  the same as for 4Q11  This is also the amount declared for 2Q12  Given quarterly fluctuations in revenues  working capital needs and other items  it makes sense to review trailing 12 months   TTM   numbers rather than quarterly numbers for the purpose of analyzing changes in reported and sustainable distributable cash flows  The definition of DCF used by BPL is described in an article titled   That article also provides  for comparison purposes  definitions used by other master limited partnerships   MLPs    Using BPL s definition  DCF for the TTM ending 6 30 12 was  309 million  up slightly from  300 million in the TTM ending 6 30 11  per unit comparisons are not meaningful due to the November 19  2010  merger between BPL  BGH  the general partner  and the general partner of BGH  The generic reasons why DCF as reported by the MLP may differ from sustainable DCF are reviewed in an article titled   Applying the method described there to BPL results through 6 30 12 generates the comparison outlined in the table below  There is no appreciable difference between reported DCF and what I term sustainable DCF for the TTM ending 3 31 12  Coverage ratios  whether viewed from a 3  6 or 12 month perspective  are below 1 0 as seen in Table 5 below I find it helpful to look at a simplified cash flow statement by netting certain items  e g   acquisitions against dispositions  and by separating cash generation from cash consumption  Here is what I see for BPL Simplified Sources and Uses of FundsTable 6 indicates a  146 million excess amount after deducting maintenance capital expenditures  net income from non controlling interests and distributions from net cash from operations in the TTM ending 6 30 12  by contrast  there was a shortfall in the comparable prior year period   This  however  is due to liquidation of working capital  mainly inventory  amounting to  188 million  see Table 4   Absent this non sustainable source  there would have been a shortfall BPL expects to spend a total of   270 million on expansion and cost reduction projects in 2012  of which  124 million has been spent in 1H12  Unlike some of the MLPs I have covered  including El Paso Pipeline Partners  EPB   Enterprise Products Partners  EPD   Plains All American Pipeline  PAA   Williams Partners  WPZ  and Targa Resource Partners  NGLS   BPL has not been generating excess cash which could help fund these capital expenditures and must therefore fund them with debt  equity or asset sales  With essentially zero cash on the balance sheet and long term debt that  at  2 3 billion  is already at 4 7x Adjusted EBITDA on a TTM basis  BPL is likely to offer additional equity  further diluting current limited partners  in February 2012  it issued 4 3 million units   Sale of the Natural Gas Storage business will reduce the amount of equity required to be raised but it is not possible to predict whether  and at what price  a sale will occurThere are some favorable factors to consider   i  2Q12 volumes on legacy pipelines and terminals increased over both 1Q12 and 2Q11   ii  the initial stage of the BORCO expansion  1 1 million barrels of storage capacity and related infrastructure  was completed on time and on budget and is fully leased   iii  performance could improve if next winter exhibits normal temperatures   iv  in June 2012  the first month with a comparable year ago period under BPL ownership  the terminals acquired from BP North America  Inc    BP   experienced over a 10  increase in revenues  and over a 14  increase in volumes compared to June 2011 and thus provided positive indication of the value BPL can extract from its acquisitions  and  v  net income in 2Q12 was negatively impacted by several special items that hopefully will not be repeated  including  2 million for environmental remediation   2 5 million of relocation expenses and  2 million of severance costs related to BP There are also negative factors  BPL missed consensus estimates every single quarter in 2011  an unfavorable trend that continued into the first and second quarters of 2012  Also of concern is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  order of March 30  2012  that disallowed proposed rate increases on the Buckeye System that would have become effective April 1  2012  The proposed rate increases were expected to increase BPL s annual revenues  and  I presume  EBITDA  by approximately  8 million  But if forced to resort to FERC s generic rate setting mechanism  the adverse impact goes well beyond forgoing this increase and could have a substantial adverse affect on BPL because it would lower tariffs on pipelines that account for  70  of BPL s revenues  This is a major issue overhanging this MLP  Consequently  despite the attractive 7 75  yield based on the current price   53 57 on August 10   I would remain on the sidelines ,2012-08-14,Ron

158251,379767,PAAS,A Closer Look At Magellan Midstream Partners  Distributable Cash Flow,opinion,On August 1  2012  Magellan Midstream Partners  L P   MMP  reported results of operations for 2Q 2012  Revenues  operating income  net income and earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization and income tax expenses  EBITDA  were as follows Strong performance was exhibited by all segments  Results for 2Q12 are inflated by a   28 million gain from a futures contract that does not qualify for a hedge treatment and therefore flows through the revenue and operating margin numbers all the way to the bottom line  Comparisons across quarterly periods can therefore be difficult to make  Net income per limited partner unit was  1 22 in 2Q12 and would have been  1 01 had the gain been excluded  Still  even absent this gain  2Q12 numbers would have exceeded management s due to improved gasoline and crude oil transportation volumes and higher commodity sales  MMP s definition of Distributable Cash Flow   DCF   and a comparison to definitions used by other master limited partnerships   MLPs   are described in one of my   Using that definition  DCF for the 12 month period ending 3 31 12 was  468 million   4 14 per unit   up from  432 million in the TTM ending 3 31 11   3 89 per unit   Given quarterly fluctuations in revenues  working capital needs and other items  it makes sense to review trailing 12 months   TTM   numbers rather than quarterly numbers for the purpose of analyzing changes in reported and sustainable distributable cash flows  In an article titled  I present the definition of DCF used by EPD and provide a comparison to definitions used by other master limited partnerships   MLPs   Using MMP s definition  DCF for the trailing twelve month   TTM   period ending 6 30 12 was  485 million   4 29 per unit   up from  449 million in the comparable prior year period   3 99 per unit   As always  I first attempt to assess how these figures compare with what I call sustainable DCF for these periods and whether distributions were funded by additional debt or issuing additional units The generic reasons why DCF as reported by the MLP may differ from sustainable DCF are reviewed in an article titled   Applying the method described there to MMP results through 2Q 2012 generates the comparison outlined in the table below  The principal differences of between sustainable and reported DCF numbers are attributable to working capital consumed  TTM ending 6 30 11  and risk management activities  both TTM periods   As detailed in my prior articles  I generally do not include working capital generated in the definition of sustainable DCF but I do deduct working capital invested Despite appearing to be inconsistent  this makes sense because in order to meet my definition of sustainability the master limited partnerships should  on the one hand  generate enough capital to cover normal working capital needs  On the other hand  cash generated from working capital is not a sustainable source and I therefore ignore it  Over reasonably lengthy measurement periods  working capital generated tends to be offset by needs to invest in working capital  I therefore do not add working capital consumed to net cash provided by operating activities in deriving sustainable DCF Risk management activities present a more complex issue  I do not generally consider cash generated by risk management activities to be sustainable  although I recognize that one could reasonable argue that bona fide hedging of commodity price risks should be included  The MMP risk management activities seem to be directly related to such hedging  so I could go both ways on this Coverage ratios appear strong  as indicated in the table below The simplified cash flow statement in the table below gives a clear picture of how distributions have been funded in the last two years  The table nets certain items  e g   debt incurred vs  repaid  and separates cash generation from cash consumption Simplified Sources and Uses of FundsThe numbers indicate solid  sustainable  performance  Net cash from operations  less maintenance capital expenditures  less cash related to net income attributable to non partners exceeded distributions by  255 million in the TTM ending 6 30 12 and by  42 million in the comparable prior year period MMP is not using cash raised from issuance of debt and equity to fund distributions  The excess enables MMP to reduce reliance on the issuance of additional partnership units or debt to fund expansion projects  Since 3Q 2010  MMP has not sold partnership units  a rare achievement in the MLP universe  It benefits from low cost of capital given there are no general partner incentive distribution rights Management raised its 2012 DCF guidance by  30 million to approximately  520 million and announced its intention to increase annual distributions by 18  for 2012  double its previous 9  growth target  with the goal of raising distributions an additional 10  for 2013  Net income per limited partner unit is estimated to be  3 90 for 2012  with third quarter guidance of  0 76  In fact  MMP s net income has equaled or exceeded distributions in each quarter since 2Q10  another rare achievement in the MLP universe  Based on past performance  there is certainly no reason to doubt management s ability to achieve its targets Over the last 8 years MMP has spent   2 5 billion on acquisitions and organic growth projects  and currently has  700 million of organic growth projects underway of which it projects spending approximately  500 million in 2012 with additional spending of approximately  200 million in 2013 to complete these projects  Of particular note is the conversion of a large portion of the partnership s Houston to El Paso pipeline to crude oil service  At  375 million  this is the largest organic growth project ever undertaken by MMP The reversed pipeline system will transport crude oil from Crane  Texas to refiners or third party pipelines in Houston and Texas City  Texas  Based on a successful open season  the capacity is being expanded from approximately 135 000 to 225 000 barrels per day and the entire capacity is fully subscribed with Permian Basin production  The reversed pipeline is expected to be operational by early 2013 and to have a materially favorable impact on MMP s results of operations beginning in 2013 In 1H12   97 million was spent on growth capital expenditures  so roughly  400 million remains to be expended during 2012  MMP has been retaining an extraordinarily high level of cash on its balance sheet since 3Q11  Cash and cash equivalents increased from  13 million as of 6 30 11 to   210 million at year end and to  234 million as of 6 30 12  Thus  MMP can fund over 50  of the remaining 2012 growth capital requirements from cash on hand Long term debt stands at a comfortable 3 1x EBITDA  2 8x if the cash is netted out  for the TTM ending 6 30 12  so I see no need  barring a major acquisition  for MMP to dilute its unit holders through additional issuances  Management prides itself on being fiscally disciplined and has stated it is unwilling to pay the premiums that other MLPs have been paying for acquisitions MMP s current yield of  4 64   as of 8 15 12  is at the lowest end of the MLP universe  Enterprise Products Partners L P   EPD  yields  4 82  and Plains All American Pipeline  PAA   4 91   but almost all the other MLPs I cover yield significantly more  For example   5 95  for Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  KMP    6 18  for Williams Partners  WPZ    6 24  for El Paso Pipeline Partners  EPB    6 37  for Targa Resources Partners  NGLS    7 87  for Buckeye Partner  BPL    7 83  for Boardwalk Pipeline Partners  BWP   and  8 15  for Energy Transfer Partners  ETP  For conservative investors MMP s price may be justified given its performance track record  disciplined management team  portfolio of growth projects  structure  no general partner incentive distributions   excess cash from operations  and proven ability to minimize limited partner dilution ,2012-08-16,Ron

158252,379768,PAAS,A Close Look At PAA s Cash Flow,opinion,On August 6  Plains All American Pipeline L P   PAA  reported results of operations for Q2 2012  Revenues  operating income  net income and earnings before interest  depreciation   amortization and income tax expenses  EBITDA  were as follows Strong performance was exhibited by all segments  particularly Supply   Logistics Two Factors Drive GrowthThe extraordinary growth in Supply   Logistics s segment profit is attributed by management to two main factors  One is the   impact of higher volumes due to increased production related to the active development of crude oil and liquids rich resource plays  The increase in volumes was primarily a result of increased drilling activities in the Bakken  Eagle Ford Shale  West Texas  Western Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle producing regions   The other relates to   increased margins related to production volumes exceeding existing pipeline takeaway capacity in certain regions and the associated logistics challenges   Management cautions that the margins delivered in 2011 may not be repeated    a normalization of margins may occur as the logistics challenges are addressed   quotes are from PAA s 2011 10 K   Results for Q1 2012 indicated a 3 8  decline in that segment s contribution compared to the prior year period  see my    However  in Q2 12  Supply   Logistics s profit contribution jumped 81  over the prior year period  Given quarterly fluctuations in revenues  working capital needs and other items  it makes sense to review trailing 12 months   TTM   numbers rather than quarterly numbers for the purpose of analyzing changes in reported and sustainable distributable cash flows  In an article titled  I present the definition of DCF used by Plains All American Pipeline L P   PAA  and provide a comparison to definitions used by other master limited partnerships  Using PAA s definition  DCF for the TTM ending 6 30 12 was  1 385 million   8 86 per unit   up from  897 million in 2010   6 29 per unit  in the TTM ending 6 30 11  As always  I first attempt to assess how these figures compare with what I call sustainable DCF for these periods and whether distributions were funded by additional debt or issuing additional units  The generic reasons why DCF as reported by the MLP may differ from sustainable DCF are reviewed in an article titled   Applying the method described there to PAA results through 6 30 12 generates the comparison outlined in Table 3 below  Big YoY IncreaseTable 3 indicates net cash provided by operating activities in the TTM ending 6 30 12 increased by  793 million vs  the TTM ending 6 30 11  The three major components of the large increase are   1  net income increased by  552 million   2  there a  121 million inventory valuation adjustment in 2Q12 which reduced net income but involved no cash outflow  and  3  working capital was consumed in the TTM ending 6 30 11 but generated in the TTM ending 6 30 12  for a net difference of  111 million  These three items total  784  The balance is accounted for by other items  For the TTM ending 6 30 12 the difference between reported DCF and sustainable DCF is mostly in the  other  category and its largest component are non cash charges  such as the inventory valuation adjustment mentioned above  that management excludes from its definition of DCF  Also worth noting is that under PAA s definition  reported DCF always excludes working capital changes  whether positive or negative Coverage ratios appear strong  as indicated in Table 4 below I find it helpful to look at a simplified cash flow statement by netting certain items  e g   acquisitions against dispositions  and by separating cash generation from cash consumption  Here is what I see for PAA Net cash from operations  less maintenance capital expenditures  less cash related to net income attributable to non controlling partners exceeded distributions by  725 million in the TTM ending 6 30 12 and by  109 million in the TTM ending 6 30 11  Clearly PAA is not using cash raised from issuance of debt and equity to fund distributions  Of the  3 2 billion gross amount spent in the TTM ending 6 30 12 on growth capital projects and acquisitions  net of sale proceeds   only  2 2 billion was funded by debt and the issuance of additional partnership units  the balance was funded from internal cash flow  This is an impressive achievement  as is the ability of PAA to generate net income in excess of distributions per unit every quarter so far since Q1 11 Growth OutlookCapital growth projects are forecasted to total  1 175 million in 2012  of which  511 million was expended in H1 12  My hope is that PAA funds the balance with debt  which it can easily do without exceeding its announced credit profile parameters  and or internally generated cash flow in order to minimize dilution to limited partners  The fact that the general partner gets 50  of any distributions in excess of  2 70 per unit per annum pushes up PAA s cost of capital and constrains the ability to increase distributions to limited partners  In the TTM ending 6 30 12  distributions per unit increased by 7  As of 8 15 12  PAA s current yield of  4 91  is higher than the  4 64  yield of Magellan Midstream Partners  MMP  and the  4 82  yield of Enterprise Products Partners L P   EPD   but lower than all the other MLPs I cover  For example   5 95  for Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  KMP    6 18  for Williams Partners  WPZ    6 24  for El Paso Pipeline Partners  EPB    6 37  for Targa Resources Partners  NGLS    7 87  for Buckeye Partner  BPL    7 83  for Boardwalk Pipeline Partners  BWP   and  8 15  for Energy Transfer Partners  ETP  PAA  EPD and MMP are all outstanding MLPs  The relatively low yields notwithstanding  their operational results have been excellent and have driven up unit prices  thus generating significant capital gains for the partners  They are a solid choice for more conservative MLP investors  The only reason I would favor EPD and MMP over PAA is the capital structure    no general partner incentive distributions for EPD and MMP vs  50  in the case of PAA
